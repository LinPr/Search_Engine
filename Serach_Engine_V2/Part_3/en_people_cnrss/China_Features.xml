(Graphic: Zero-sum or zero-carbon/People's Daily Online)</span></p> <p> The Glasgow climate summit held last year was largely viewed as a chance for redemption. After the grim outcome of the (2°C) mitigation target set at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, humanity's "last chance" to save the planet, nations were nudged to give climate cooperation another shot. Few world leaders are more zealous and vocal on the matter than US president Joe Biden, who has proposed a portfolio of ambitious goals and called for joint collaboration between major players and, in particular, the US and China.</p> <p> Then, last February, in a surprise move, the Biden administration announced that it would extend the Trump-era Section 201 tariffs slapped on solar panels, in a bid to "continue facilitating positive adjustment to competition" from imported photovoltaic cells. Though the administration did offer some clues on the "positive adjustment," almost four years after the tariffs were levied, experts argued that America's solar industry remained nascent in its development despite full-blown trade barriers and that the decision came at an emissions cost.</p> <p> In an opinion essay published earlier this month in <em>The Hill</em>, John Paul Helveston, an American researcher, debated that tariffs won't help the US build a "robust solar industry." He contended that China's tremendous R&amp;D efforts on photovoltaic (PV) innovations, which helped slash the prices of most PV panels from $2,000 per kilowatt to just $300 per kilowatt, cannot be simply duplicated. It is highly unlikely that another nation will be able to "replicate China's skills in the time frame needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change," he cited an article he co-wrote in <em>Science </em>back in 2019, adding, "Rather than continuing the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese solar panels, the US and others should be partnering with Chinese firms to obtain low-cost technologies and components to increase domestic deployment of renewables as fast as possible to meet the narrow window left to decarbonize."</p> <p> Low-cost solar technologies and components, however, have been the very items subject to Washington's ongoing investigation.</p> <p> The New York Times reported on April 29 that, amidst an investigation by the US Commerce Department targeting Chinese-made PV parts, the US solar industry has been "frozen," with over 300 solar projects being "canceled or delayed." American energy enterprises, big and small, have all been dragged into the quagmire of self-censorship over Chinese solar parts. "The investigation is having a catastrophic negative impact on the renewable energy sector and driving up electricity prices. With each day the tariff investigation continues, the country is falling further behind in achieving our climate goals," said Nick Bullinger, COO of a Chicago-based solar company, in an interview that appeared in the <em>Times </em>article.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0512/FOREIGN202205121524000530389177826.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>U.S. President Joe Biden (R) speaks during an event, at the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, on May 9, 2022. Biden said that the administration is "discussing" whether to drop hiked tariffs on Chinese products. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> From the perspective of environmental benefits or from the standpoint of economic interests, Washington's 4-year-long-and-counting solar clampdown is cost-ineffective, as it collides with even Biden's own climate agenda.</p> <p> US president Joe Biden attended the Glasgow summit with high hopes—100% renewable energy by 2035; but the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), an NGO, estimated that America's current production capacity only makes up 15% of its demand. Neither will taxing and purging Chinese solar panels or PV parts help "bring jobs back home," since even with heavy tariffs the US remains heavily dependent on imported PV products.</p> <p> Besides, the volume of jobs generated by solar installations in the US is ten times larger than the manufacturing jobs created by the nation's entire solar sector, according to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). As a letter sent to President Biden last January by eight American senators (from both parties) stated, the Section 201 tariffs had "led to the loss of more than 62,000 American clean energy jobs and 10.5 gigawatts of foregone solar deployment." It is difficult then to tell who the tariffs and investigation are designed to punish: overseas solar producers or the American labor force?</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0512/FOREIGN202205121527000336131916818.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> But it's not hard to detect what formula is being applied in America's zero-carbon solution—its default zero-sum fixation. After all, the one-nation's-gain-representing-another's-loss mindset takes various shapes in the China-US relations from Washington's point of view.</p> <p> On the global stage, it is reflected in Washington's unreasonable belief that China's global presence, such as donating COVID-19 vaccines to developing nations, will undermine the superpower's global influence.</p> <p> In the economic sphere, it is manifested in America's obsession with punitive tariffs, which it deems will help reverse trade deficits and boost domestic industry, even though the burden will ultimately be shifted towards American consumers in the form of rising prices.</p> <p> In the technological and academic realms, it is showcased in America's year-long crackdown on Chinese tech companies and its unjustified witch-hunt targeting Chinese academics and students.</p> <p> ... ...</p> <p> The aforementioned aspects of Washington's zero-sum practices are epitomized by its now-stagnant solar industry, which in turn has demonstrated why such a mindset won't work. Internationally, it will risk hindering the joint cause of emissions reduction; economically, it will impede the low-hanging fruits and long-term benefits brought by the should-be full-fledged solar sector; and, from the perspectives of innovation and technological progress, it will further dampen the outlook of cooperation on green innovations.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0512/FOREIGN202205121521000527071017527.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 800px;" /></p> <p> <em>Aerial panoramic photo taken on April 21, 2022 shows the Dalad Photovoltaic Power Base in Dalad Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Liu Lei)</em></p> <p> Dwelling on a planet that is currently plagued by a global pandemic (accompanied by inflation and a possible recession), haunted by continuous wars and conflicts, and overshadowed by the looming threat of global warming, we all know that a zero-sum fixation and a Cold-War mindset won't help fix any of these global problems. On the contrary, they are destined to make the planet warmer, wars deadlier, and other global puzzles more insoluble.</p> <p> For Washington, it needs to face the reality that it cannot achieve technological hegemony or climate leadership by setting up a new Iron Curtain to deter and isolate China. Returning to a rational and pragmatic China policy is the sole way to nurture healthy and sustainable China-US ties and encourage the two sides to work together on issues of common and global concern. Conversely, the zero-sum mindset is bound for a lose-lose path.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291627000231064255975.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 480px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Graphic/People's Daily Online</em></p> <p> A shooter. A gun. A train of helpless commuters. In what should be a rush-hour nightmare on the NYC subway on April 12, Gerard Baker saw something different. The renowned Wall Street Journal columnist diagnosed the Brooklyn subway attack as an emblem of the "failure of American government at all levels." The failure, as he elaborated in his opinion piece headlined <em>A Crime Scene Where the Victims Wore Masks</em>, has permeated everything: from the mask mandate to law enforcement to the border crisis…</p> <p> Except for one thing: gun control.</p> <p> Ignoring the gun issue in a gun violence incident is ridiculous enough, and it is equally absurd that mask-wearing had to bear the onus at a crime scene. But sadly, such an attitude falls in line with the popular belief shared by a significant number of Americans, that "excessive" mask mandates are somehow more noxious to society than an excessive number of guns. It reflects a disturbing anomaly in today's America, where, even during a pandemic, guns are viewed as a necessity while masks are treated as a liability.</p> <p> Too many guns have always been a perennial problem in American society, which has gradually explored its own way of "living with guns"—defending firearms with more firearms. On average, one hundred Americans own some 120.5 guns, according to available data published by the Small Arms Survey, which estimated that 81.4 million Americans who possess (393 million) guns make up about 46% of the world's total civilian firearms ownership.</p> <p> America's superabundance of civilian-held guns is a problem of its own making. Gun shops in the US are so omnipresent that they outnumber Starbucks, McDonald's and grocery stores combined, according to Statista. With lax and counteractive federal and state laws as well as loose background checks, buying a lethal weapon in America is so easy that "it doesn't make sense," as former US president Barack Obama once declared.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291630000171159557858.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 601px;" /></p> <p> <em>Guns are on display at the Dallas Gun Show in Parker, a suburban city of Dallas, Texas, the United States, Jan. 22, 2022. (Photo by Lin Li/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> During the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans' gun hoarding habit has grown out of control. Forbes reported that Americans bought 19.9 million firearms last year, the second-highest year only after 2020, which saw a record-setting of 22.8 million purchases of firearms. "There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic," said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, an American politician.</p> <p> Accompanying the surging gun sales is the soaring number of gun violence incidents: both gun-related suicides and homicides have spiked in the US. Between March 01, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the US saw a 30% upsurge in nationwide gun violence rates, according to a report published in Nature. In 2020 alone, 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US, of which 54% were suicide deaths, 611 people died from mass shootings and 19,508 from gun-related homicide or murder (In 2021, all of these numbers continued to climb).</p> <p> Racism-driven shootings (e.g., 2021 Atlanta spa shootings) and indiscriminate mass shootings (such as the Brooklyn subway shooting), among other gruesome gun-related homicides, occur so often that they almost make America's gun crisis sound like a cliché, receiving a period of attention that is so short-lived that hardly has the next gun tragedy arrives that the previous one starts to fade away from the public's radar. So much so that Americans and the global audience have already developed their immunity to the "horrifying shooting—crying for gun control—political impasse—more horrifying shooting" vicious circle.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291649000526489401587.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>A sign reminding passengers to wear face masks is seen on the window of a subway train in Chicago, the United States, on Feb. 28, 2022. (Photo by Vincent D. Johnson/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> Masks, on the other hand, have faced a totally different fate in American society. Their very existence has come under serious doubts and "life-threatening" challenges since the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed almost one million Americans.</p> <p> They survived two American presidents: Trump mocked the act of mask-wearing and refused to wear one until July 2020; Biden prematurely dropped the mask mandate for vaccinated people briefly before another surge of cases hit the US.</p> <p> They were rendered useless in states like Florida and Texas, belittled as ineffective by politicians, including US senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, and portrayed by popular media outlets such as the FOX News as something that can achieve nothing, but are attacks on the public's "liberty" and "freedom."</p> <p> Finally, on April 18, a Florida judge struck down the federal mask mandate on airplanes and other public transit systems. At a time when only 66% of Americans are fully vaccinated, a rate far below the number needed for optimal herd immunity, and with daily averages still above 50,000 new cases, the ruling has invited grave concerns and criticisms. "The science on masking did not change (with the ruling)," wrote Aaron E. Carroll, a public health expert, in a New York Times article. He added that the reason why several governors and businesses didn't hesitate to abandon mask requirements (even long before the ruling) is that "these groups have interests that compete with science."</p> <p> Despite their treatments being poles apart, guns and masks point to the exact same crisis management mechanism in the US, where one group's liberty takes precedence over the whole society's safety, where science and expertise yield to political or business interests, where saving more lives isn't as convincing to some politicians as saving more votes. In such an upended reality, it's hard to fathom when enough will finally be enough.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

According to statistics released by the World Health Organization, artemisinin has save millions of lives since artemisinin-based drugs were promoted globally as antimalarials. More than 240 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have benefited from artemisinin treatment, and about 1.5 million patients have escaped death thanks to this treatment.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291053000556323044209.jpg" style="width: 832px; height: 578px;" /></p> <p> <em>Chinese herbal expert Tu Youyou wins the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for her contributions to malaria treatment, Oct. 5, 2015.</em></p> <p> The story of artemisinin mirrors the mutual assistance offered by China and other developing countries.</p> <p> As a result of China's success in eradicating malaria at home, it has also launched large foreign-aid programs to help other countries prevent the disease with artemisinin.</p> <p> By the end of 2021, China had provided billions of doses of artemisinin medicines, trained tens of thousands of anti-malaria professionals for developing countries, assisted in the construction of malaria prevention and treatment centers for 30 countries, and sent 28,000 medical team members to 72 developing countries for malaria prevention and treatment.

Solidarity and cooperation remain the most powerful weapons against global and regional public health challenges. Be it joining hands with the rest of the world to combat malaria, or joining international cooperation in the fight against SARS, bird flu, Ebola and COVID-19, China has always been giving a helping hand to other countries to tide over difficulties.</p> <p> Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has carried out its largest emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It has provided hundreds of billions of anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations and supplied 2.1 billion doses of vaccine to more than 120 countries and international organizations. It is making COVID-19 vaccines an accessible and affordable public product for developing countries.</p> <p> From eliminating major infectious diseases such as malaria, to promoting international cooperation on the fight against COVID-19, China has always put people and their lives in the first place, which is responsible for not only the health and lives of the Chinese, but also the global public health cause. With concrete actions, the country is practicing the vision of building a global community of health for all and building a powerful joint force for the world to fight COVID-19.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> Chinese President Xi Jinping called on countries to continue developing and strengthening Asia, demonstrate Asia’s resilience, wisdom and strength, and make Asia an anchor for world peace, a powerhouse for global growth and a new pacesetter for international cooperation in his recent keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2022.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0427/FOREIGN202204270919000350970247272.png" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>The CDA5B1 meter-gauge AC transmission diesel locomotives produced by CRRC Qishuyan Co., Ltd. for Thailand are loaded onto a ship at a wharf of Changzhou west port in Changzhou city, east China’s Jiangsu province, Dec. 20, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/Shi Kang)</em></p> <p> Having been through hot and cold wars, hardships and tribulations, people in Asia deeply cherish the value of peace and understand that development gains do not come easily. Xi’s propositions put forward at the recently-concluded annual conference of the BFA&nbsp;charted directions for maintaining peace, promoting cooperation, and enhancing solidarity among Asian countries and pointed the way for their seizing historic opportunity to build a community with a shared future for Asia.</p> <p> Over the past decades, Asia has enjoyed overall stability and rapid and continued economic growth, making possible the Asian Miracle.</p> <p> “Peace and stability in our region does not fall into our lap automatically or come as charity from any country. Rather, it is the result of the joint efforts of countries in the region,” Xi pointed out in his speech.</p> <p> Rising from the misery inflicted by colonialism, militarism, and hegemonism, Asia knows the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century.</p> <p> The current European security crisis has made more and more Asian countries realize that they can only keep their future in their own hands when they&nbsp;honor such principles as mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, and follow a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0427/FOREIGN202204270920000019914984621.png" style="width: 863px; height: 575px;" /></p> <p> <em>The first special train running between Yichun city, east China’s Jiangxi province, and the ASEAN countries via Ningbo city, east China’s Zhejiang province, is being loaded at the section No. 370 of the Jiangxi provincial bureau of the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration at Yichunxi Railway Station, Jan. 27, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Zhou Liang)</em></p> <p> Against the backdrop of&nbsp;weak and faltering global economic recovery, Asia is an important powerhouse for global economic growth.</p> <p> In 2021, the share of the Asian economy in the world economy rose to 47.4 percent at purchasing power parity, and the growth rate of the Asian economy is expected to reach 4.8 percent in 2022, higher than the global average, according to a report released during the BFA Annual Conference 2022.</p> <p> Win-win cooperation is a sure path to Asian development and the key to Asia’s long-term steady development.</p> <p> Asia-Pacific countries have always upheld globalization and multilateralism, said Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, member of Council of Advisors of the BFA, former Under-Secretary-General&nbsp;of the United Nations (UN), and former Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP).</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0427/FOREIGN202204270920000345666692732.png" style="width: 865px; height: 576px;" /></p> <p> <em>The first international freight train trip from Xi’an, capital of northwest China’s Shaanxi province to Vientiane, capital of Laos, via the China-Laos Railway starts from Xi’an International Logistics and Trade Park, April 22, 2022.

Countries on the continent are bound to make new strides in mutually beneficial cooperation.</p> <p> The prosperity and stability in Asia is hard-won and couldn’t be cherished too much. Choosing dialogue and cooperation over zero-sum games, openness and inclusiveness over a closed-door and exclusive approach, and exchanges and mutual learning over a sense of superiority: this is the only choice worthy of the broad-mindedness of Asians.</p> <p> It is the heartfelt wish shared by people in Asia that countries follow the path of peace and development, seek win-win cooperation, and contribute to an Asian family of unity and progress together.</p> <p> Asian countries are wise and capable enough to cement ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture, and uphold a regional order that balances the aspirations and accommodates the interests of all parties.</p> <p> As Asia enjoys sound development momentum, countries both in and outside the region should all add splendor rather than trouble to the region, which should be the basic norm for their participation in Asian affairs.</p> <p> Any attempt to stick to the Cold War mentality and deliberately provoke confrontation to undermine the development of Asia will find little support.</p> <p> As a member of the Asian family, China will always be an active participant in and important contributor to the peaceful development and win-win cooperation in Asia, no matter how the world changes.</p> <p> China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, as well as openness and cooperation, actively advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and promote the implementation of the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative it proposed, thus continuously injecting positive energy into the peace, development and win-win cooperation in Asia and the world.</p> <p> As Xi said, to break through the mist and embrace a bright future, the biggest strength comes from cooperation and the most effective way is through solidarity.</p> <p> The open, inclusive, and confident China will stand with various countries in solidarity under the banner of true multilateralism. They will stay committed to the regionalism featuring lasting peace, common development, and openness, and jointly build a community with a shared future for Asia and a community with a shared future for mankind.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

Acts to remove any single part will cause serious problems to its operation. When that happens, both the victims and the initiators of such acts will stand to lose."</p> <p> President Xi's simile vividly explained that countries around the world share a same future. Facing outstanding global challenges, the right choice remains to enhance international cooperation and give full play to the global governance system, rather than doing the opposite and arbitrarily hindering international cooperation under all kinds of excuses.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, some countries have been trying to tie the whole world to it, turning world economy into a political issue, a tool and even a weapon, with a total disregard for whether it would impact the life of the people around the world.</p> <p> Such practice will not help solve the crisis at all, and may destroy the international economic cooperation outcomes achieved in the past decades.</p> <p> As it confronts global governance challenges, the world must uphold real multilateralism.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0426/FOREIGN202204260933000562681600379.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 449px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 17 shows the International Conference Center of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)</em></p> <p> While the globe remains in the grip of the pandemic, it is facing new traditional security risks. Meanwhile, the widening development gap is further bothering the sluggish global recovery, and new issues such as digital governance are emerging while climate change and other governance issues still need to be addressed.</p> <p> It is never a good idea to go it alone to solve these problems. Global actions, response and cooperation are required to overcome these concerns. Only by practicing a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, can countries expand common ground and build the most powerful strength.</p> <p> Hegemonism and power politics are presently posing a grave danger to the world's peace and progress. It is urgent to uphold true multilateralism and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which is also a common aspiration of the international society.</p> <p> Major country must fulfill their responsibilities as the world rises up to global governance challenges.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0426/FOREIGN202204260935000006442891302.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" /></p> <p> <em>A sub-forum of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 is held, April 20, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)</em></p> <p> A country’s international status is measured by its openness of mind, breadth of vision, and sense of responsibility rather than its size, strength or power. "It is particularly important for major countries to lead by example in honoring equality, cooperation, good faith and the rule of law, and act in a way befitting their status," President Xi said.</p> <p> To maintain their hegemonic status, a few major countries have stuck to Cold War mentality and provoked confrontations, which further exacerbated tensions and separation, making more troubles for the troubled world.</p> <p> In today’s world, unilateralism and excessive pursuit of self-interest are doomed to fail; so are the practices of decoupling, supply disruption and maximum pressure; so are the attempts to forge “small circles” or to stoke conflict and confrontation along ideological lines. Major countries should follow the trend of the times and play a constructive role in global governance.</p> <p> China is enhancing and improving global governance with concrete actions. Facing the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, it is actively promoting all relevant parties to improve global public health governance, so as to build concerted strength against the virus. When addressing the outstanding security risks, it has proposed a Global Security Initiative to contribute to the reform of the global security governance system. To jump-start the sluggish world economy, the country is also committed to improving global economic governance and building an open world economy. It has raised and is implementing the Global Development Initiative to help countries tide over difficulties.</p> <p> Countries around the world are like passengers aboard the same ship who share the same destiny. For the ship to navigate the storm and sail toward a bright future, all passengers must pull together. The thought of throwing anyone overboard is simply not acceptable.</p> <p> Difficulties and challenges are not to be afraid of. What's important is to up hold solidarity and be courageous. China will collaborate with the international community to follow the trend of the times featuring peace, development and win-win cooperation, cope with global challenges with cooperation and enhance global governance with concrete actions, so as to move in the direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

It represents vivid practice of the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind in the security field, and contributes China’s solutions to problems haunting global security governance.</p> <p> “It has been proven time and again that the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century,” Xi said in his keynote speech.</p> <p> Building a world that enjoys universal security is a shared aspiration of people in all countries. Humanity is living in an indivisible security community, and countries must explore a path that ensures security for all, by all and of all.</p> <p> In order to maintain peace and stability in the world, countries must adhere to the correct security vision. The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi stressed that it is important that all countries stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250910000219508789290.jpg" style="width: 864px; height: 576px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo shows a view of the sub-forum on energy development of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, which kicked off in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province, on April 20, 2022.

It represents the core concept and laid a basic foundation for building a world that enjoys universal security.</p> <p> Countries must abandon the outdated Cold War mentality if they want to maintain world peace and stability. Quite a number of the security issues today have been caused by certain countries’ pursuit of hegemonism and power politics.</p> <p> The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi calls on countries to stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reject the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and say no to group politics and bloc confrontation; and stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, uphold the principle of indivisible security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the pursuit of one’s own security at the cost of others’ security.</p> <p> Conforming to the historical trend toward economic globalization, multi-polarity in the world and democracy in international relations, the Global Security Initiative emphasizes that security is universal, equal, inclusive, and should be based on mutual respect between countries and the premise that all countries jointly uphold the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which sets forth specific principles at bilateral and multilateral levels for building a world that enjoys universal security.</p> <p> Responsible actions must be taken so as to maintain peace and stability in the world. In today’s world, security means much more than before and its implications go well beyond a single region or time frame. All sorts of factors could have a bearing on a country’s security.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250910000561674456196.jpg" style="width: 865px; height: 486px;" /></p> <p> <em>Aerial photo taken on April 12, 2022 shows the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) International Conference Center in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province.&nbsp;(People’s Daily Online/Yuan Chen)</em></p> <p> The ways countries resolve differences and disputes and respond to various security threats determine the direction in which the international security situation develops.</p> <p> The Global Security Initiative encourages countries to stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between them through dialogue and consultation, support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, reject double standards, and oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction; and stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and work together on regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity.</p> <p> By stressing the importance of promoting security through dialogue and cooperation, taking a multi-pronged and holistic approach, and basing actions on the present situation while adopting a long-term perspective, the initiative offers feasible ideas for achieving long-term peace, stability and security in the world.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo/Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Grenada)</em></p> <p> Countries should follow a people-centered approach, place development and people’s well-being high on the agenda and advance practical cooperation in such key areas as poverty reduction, food security, development financing and industrialization, in a bid to address uneven and inadequate development, Xi pointed out, adding that China is working with the international community on the solid implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) he proposed last year.</p> <p> Xi’s proposals demonstrate China’s sense of responsibility and unwavering commitment to advancing the global development cause and build a global community of development with a shared future.</p> <p> “The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously eroded the gains the world has made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Uneven recovery is aggravating inequality across the world, further widening the North-South divide,” Xi noted.</p> <p> The impacts of the Ukraine crisis have continued to spill over into more regions, putting more strain on the world economy, which has already faced with fragile and weak recovery.</p> <p> Changes of the world, of the times and of history are posing severe challenges to the global development cause, which must be taken seriously by humanity.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250906000105053426654.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 3, 2022 shows the busy Nansha Port, Longxue Island, Nansha district, Guangzhou city, south China’s Guangdong province. (People’s Daily Online/Wei Jinsong)</em></p> <p> The pandemic has resulted in the relapse of several emerging nations into poverty and instability. Numerous people in developed countries are also living through a hard time due to the pandemic.</p> <p> “Safety and health are the prerequisite for human development and progress,” Xi said, emphasizing the need of countries supporting each other, better coordinating response measures and improving global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic.</p> <p> More than 10 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally, but about 83 percent of Africa’s population has yet to receive a single dose. The top priority for countries at the moment is to close the immunization gap.</p> <p> China has honored its commitment to making Chinese COVID vaccines a global public good and tried to ensure their accessibility and affordability in developing countries, according to Xi. The country has provided over 2.1 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations, and will follow through the pledged donation of 600 million and 150 million doses of vaccines to Africa and ASEAN countries respectively.</p> <p> The global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted; commodity prices continue to climb; and energy supply remains tight. These risks amplify one another and exacerbate the uncertainties surrounding economic recovery.</p> <p> The global low inflation environment has notably changed, and the risks of inflation driven by multiple factors are surfacing. If major economies slammed on the brakes or took a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability.</p> <p> Xi urged countries to increase macro policy coordination, turn to science and technology for more growth drivers, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and prevent serious negative spillovers from policy adjustments in some countries to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development.</p> <p> In the planet that we call home, humankind shares the same future. Only by staying on top of the dominant trend of economic globalization and adhering to the times' tendency of peace, development and win-win cooperation can human beings jointly surmount difficulties and embrace a brighter future.</p> <p> True development is development for all and good development is sustainable. The entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the completion and operation of the China-Laos Railway have effectively improved regional “hard connectivity” of infrastructure and “soft connectivity” of rules and standards, demonstrating how win-win cooperation between countries drives development.、</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250906000242369811511.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 534px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 17, 2022 shows national flags of various counties fluttering in the wind at the Qionghai Boao Airport in Boao township, south China’s Hainan province, host township of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People’s Daily Online/Meng Zhongde)</em></p> <p> China has actively pressed ahead with high-quality Belt and Road cooperation for high-standard, sustainable and people-centered growth, injecting strong impetus into the sustainable development of countries along the routes of the initiative. The GDI proposed by China has been echoed and supported by the United Nations and other international organizations and nearly 100 countries. These are convincing evidence of China’s efforts to promote the global development cause in pursuit of win-win results.</p> <p> As the Ukraine crisis continues to escalate, geopolitical factors are encumbering global economic recovery and further disrupting the global development cause; developing countries are bearing the brunt of the effects.</p> <p> China has persisted in promoting peace talks and stressed that all parties should create the necessary environment and conditions for advancing peace talks. This is a decision made by the country not only for world peace and security, but for global development.</p> <p> “A review of human history teaches us that the more difficult things get, the greater the need grows to stay confident,” Xi pointed out. China will continue to join hands with various countries and create tremendous synergy through win-win cooperation to together overcome various roadblocks along the way, promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development, and push forward the global development cause.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has prompted the international community to reflect upon security issues plaguing today’s world.</p> <p> “The root cause of the Ukraine crisis is the regional security tensions in Europe that have built up over the years. A fundamental solution is to accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all relevant parties,” pointed out Chinese President Xi Jinping when meeting via video link with President Charles Michel of the European Council and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission on the evening of April 1.</p> <p> By advocating the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, China has played a constructive role in easing the tensions between Russia and Ukraine.</p> <p> In today’s world where economic globalization is enjoying intensive development, all countries share weal and woe and a common future, and no country in the world can enjoy absolute security.</p> <p> Under such new circumstances, the implications of security go far beyond the security based on confrontation and balance of power during the Cold War, but show more interconnectedness and diversity.</p> <p> A new security situation in the world calls for a new vision of security. “We need to keep pace with the changing circumstances and evolving times. One cannot live in the 21st century with the outdated thinking from the age of Cold War and zero-sum game. We believe that it is necessary to advocate common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security in Asia,” Xi said at the fourth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia in 2014.</p> <p> Since then, the Chinese leader has continuously expounded on and developed this security outlook to facilitate the adoption of a new security vision in line with the trend of the times by the international community, which fully demonstrates China’s sincere desire to strengthen global security governance.</p> <p> The vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security is based on profound insights into the experience and lessons learned by human society in dealing with security issues and focused on the goal of long-term peace, stability and security of the world. It has injected new and rich connotations into global security governance.</p> <p> Common security means respecting and ensuring the security of each and every country involved. Security is a two-way and interconnected issue, Xi said at the opening ceremony of the 86th Interpol General Assembly in 2017. It is inadvisable for a country to care only about its own security in total disregard of the security of others and seek the so-called absolute security of itself at the expense of the security of others, such practice would end up hurting oneself.</p> <p> Comprehensive security means upholding security in both traditional and non-traditional fields. As traditional security threats and non-traditional ones are intertwined, only by introducing a multi-pronged and comprehensive policy can countries effectively deal with various security challenges.</p> <p> Cooperative security means promoting the security of both individual countries and the region as a whole through dialogue and cooperation. As a Kazakh proverb goes, “One who tries to blow out other’s oil lamp will get his beard on fire”, which is a vivid reflection of the current reality. Countries must abandon the zero-sum game mentality and promote peace and security through cooperation.</p> <p> Sustainable security means that the countries involved need to focus on both development and security to realize durable security. Only by paying attention to development deficit behind security deficit can countries consolidate the foundations for security and address both symptoms and root causes of security issues.</p> <p> The Ukrainian crisis has made the world realize that in this day and age, global and regional security frameworks should no longer be built with Cold War mentality.</p> <p> To promote a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and the resumption of peace, China has continuously promoted peace talks, stressed that a fundamental solution to the crisis is to accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all relevant parties, and supported the establishment of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism.</p> <p> China’s constructive stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict demonstrates its sense of responsibility as a major country in practicing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and persisting in world peace construction.</p> <p> However, the NATO led by the U.S. has sought its own security at the expense of the security of other countries and regions and pursued regional security by expanding a military bloc with Cold War mentality, posing the biggest threat to international security.</p> <p> The Ukraine crisis has revealed to the world that real security requires joint construction and sharing, rather than forming a small circle to keep others out by exaggerating security threats.</p> <p> At present, the world is neither tranquil nor stable. The prevailing trend of peace and development is facing serious challenges. Therefore, upholding and practicing a correct security vision becomes a matter of great urgency.</p> <p> China will stick to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and join hands with other countries to strengthen global security governance, address various security challenges, and make unremitting efforts to build a world of lasting peace and universal security. &nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> “In the U.S., there was a continued rise in the anti-Asian incidents during the period when the coronavirus pandemic ran rampant in the country,” said a report released by the China Society for Human Rights Studies on April 15.</p> <p> The report reveals the dark history and harsh reality of the racial discrimination against Asians in the U.S. society, emphasizing that Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans are subject to discrimination and violations in various forms, and cannot fully enjoy their human rights.</p> <p> It claims that the increasing racial discrimination against Asians exposes the country’s fundamental racist nature.</p> <p> Some U.S. politicians and media outlets are reluctant to acknowledge the racial discrimination against Asian Americans, but massive incidents are telling the truth that such discrimination is getting severer.</p> <p> According to a survey released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB), hate crime cases in the U.S. decreased by 7 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, but those against Asian Americans increased by 149 percent.</p> <p> According to a report published on Nov. 18, 2021 by the national coalition Stop Asian American and Pacific Islander Hate, from March 19, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, a total of 10,370 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander people were reported to the organization, with the majority of the incidents took place in public spaces such as public streets and businesses.</p> <p> Statistics released by the New York City Police Department on Dec. 8, 2021 showed that anti-Asian hate crimes in the city rose by 361 percent from that of 2020.</p> <p> There’s a Chinese saying that it takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in March 2021 that "Thousands of incidents across the past year have perpetuated a centuries-long history of intolerance, stereotyping, scapegoating, exploitation and abuse."</p> <p> Discrimination on a systematic basis is akin to a long-standing malignancy in the United States. In the late 19th century, some politicians and media deliberately stigmatized Asian Americans as "Yellow Peril," and in 1924, all Asians were forbidden to immigrate to the U.S.</p> <p> Asian Americans have suffered from long-time prejudice, exclusion, and racial violence. The Associated Press once observed that "Racism against Asian Americans has long been an ugly thread in the U.S. history."</p> <p> In recent years, U.S. politicians have poisoned the U.S. society through political manipulation, which made the racial discrimination against Asians even more rampant. They politicized, labeled and stigmatized the virus, further exacerbating the discrimination against Asian Americans.</p> <p> White House press secretary admitted that there was "no question" that the former U.S. administration's "damaging rhetoric" led to "elevated threats against Asian Americans." In September 2020, 164 Republican congressmen voted against the bill condemning discrimination against Asian Americans.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the current U.S. government proceeded to manipulate the public opinion and politicize the COVID-19 origins tracing, further stoking the Anti-Asian sentiments within the U.S. Deceived by some U.S. politicians' and media's lies about the coronavirus pandemic, some African Americans mistook Asian Americans as their enemy and attacked Asian Americans to vent their anger. What the U.S. politician did has further indulged the racial discrimination against Asian Americans.</p> <p> The increasing racial discrimination against Asians reflects a mindset of the U.S.: bullying the weak, which comes from the “white supremacy” environment. The U.S. government and society have long turned a deaf ear to Asian Americans' complaints of racism and discrimination. The U.S. has never compensated for or reflected on the sufferings it has inflicted on Asian Americans, and even tries its best to cover up or blur relevant facts.</p> <p> In the U.S., Asian Americans are portrayed as outsiders in racial conflicts. Such identification of Asian Americans in the U.S. makes them the target of racist exclusion. Numerous vicious violent attacks against Asian Americans have gone unfiled as hate crimes. After the three shootings that occurred in Atlanta on March 16, 2021, the spokesman of the local police office openly denied that it was a hate crime and even defended the shooter by claiming that he was having a "bad day." Being labeled as a "permanent alien" is a traumatic experience shared by many Asian Americans, said BBC in a report.</p> <p> The cold reality reflects that Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans are subject to discrimination and violations in various forms, despite the fact that they have made prominent contributions to the progress of the U.S. society and that the ethnic composition of the United States is changing.</p> <p> The poor records of the U.S. on racial problems mirror the deep-rooted institutional and structural deficits of the U.S. society, profoundly reveal the hypocrisy of the “American human rights,” and debunk the so-called “beacon of human rights.”</p> <p> (Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

The report filled with lies and prejudice pointed fingers at the human rights situation of nearly 200 countries and regions around the world, and, just like its predecessors released in previous years did, discredited and smeared China on issues including those related to northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and southwest China’s Tibet autonomous region.</p> <p> A U.S. politician recently claimed that there has been “an alarming recession of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights in many parts of the world.” As a matter of fact, it is the U.S. that should reflect on the recession of its democracy and human rights situation more than any other country.</p> <p> The January 2021 Capitol Hill attack has revealed to the world the reality of American democracy disorder.</p> <p> A national public opinion poll of America’s 18- to 29-year-olds showed that 52 percent of the respondents believed that the American democracy was “in trouble” or “failing,” and only 7 percent of the surveyed young Americans viewed the U.S. as a “healthy democracy”, according to an article published on the website of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School on Dec. 1, 2021.</p> <p> “While President Biden is hosting a global democracy summit, our own democracy right here is falling apart,” an article in USA Today quoted Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a voting rights group, as saying.</p> <p> “The United States must first lead by example and address its own failings,” the article said.</p> <p> U.S. President Joe Biden should be “entirely honest about the grave problems in his own country’s democracy”, according to an article published in American magazine The National Interest, which stressed that “democratic standards should apply to everyone, and are not just a vocabulary that the powerful use to lecture the weak.”</p> <p> While repeatedly hyping up lies including the false allegations of the so-called “genocide” and “forced labor” in Xinjiang, politicians in the U.S. chose to forget their country’s disgraceful records in history as well as at present, including the slaughter of Indians, forced labor, and appalling prisoner abuse at black sites set up by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) all over the world.</p> <p> The U.S. has a long and dark history of violating the rights of indigenous people, including Indians, who have experienced bloody massacres, brutal expulsions and cultural genocide.</p> <p> Under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the actions of the U.S. constitute genocide, pointed out The Washington Post.</p> <p> The U.S. has been faced with serious problems of human trafficking and forced labor. In the past five years, up to 100,000 people have been trafficked into the U.S. for forced labor annually.</p> <p> The reality is slavery never ended in America, said an article published on the website of Richmond Times-Dispatch, the major daily newspaper in Richmond, Virginia.</p> <p> The U.S. has set up black sites in at least 54 countries and regions around the world under the pretext of “War on Terror”, and secretly put the alleged terrorist suspects under arbitrary detention and extorted confessions by torture. About 100,000 people have been detained, and the detainees include Muslims, females and children. These black sites are ironclad evidence of America’s willful trampling on the rule of law and violation of human rights.</p> <p> The U.S. should really make efforts to alleviate its deteriorating human rights situation, instead of making indiscreet remarks on the human rights situation of other countries.</p> <p> Over the past more than two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. has reported a cumulative total of more than 80 million confirmed cases and nearly one million deaths from the virus, while the average life expectancy in the country fell by 1.13 years, becoming the world’s No. 1 anti-pandemic failure.</p> <p> The combined assets of the richest one percent of Americans were nearly 16 times that of the poorest 50 percent, and the gap between rich and poor has been aggravated, according to the Report on the Economic Well-Being of the U.S. Households in 2020 released by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the U.S.</p> <p> The “virus” of deeply-entrenched racism in the U.S. has been spreading along with the novel coronavirus, with racial economic divide increasingly widening and racial inequality continuously growing.</p> <p> Gun violence has been on the rise in the U.S. At least 10,362 people were killed by gun violence in the U.S. in the first three months of 2022, and an average of more than 115 people in the country lose their lives to gun violence every day.</p> <p> In March 2021, during the review of the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review of the U.S. by the 46th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, many countries pointed out that the human rights situation in the U.S. was terrible and urged the country to immediately stop human rights violations in all forms and take practical measures to avoid further deterioration of human rights situation.</p> <p> By politicizing and weaponizing human rights issues, the U.S. has wantonly interfered in the internal affairs of other countries and maintained its hegemony under the pretext of human rights.</p> <p> In recent years, the rise in China’s comprehensive national strength has given some politicians in the U.S. the “anxiety disorder”. Sticking to the Cold War mentality, these politicians have racked their brains to play zero-sum games and use democracy and human rights as tools to smear China and whitewash their own hegemonic acts.</p> <p> The so-called human rights advocated by the U.S. government are not in the least related to the genuine concept and that the country only takes advantage of the banner of human rights to advance its global strategy, said James Peck, adjunct instructor with New York University in History and East Asia Departments.</p> <p> Democracy is by no means the prerogative of a few nations, and should not become a tool used by one country to put pressure on other countries and engage in political blackmail.</p> <p> The U.S. has acted against the trend of history and intensified efforts to promote politicization of human rights issues in a bid to safeguard its hegemonic interests, seriously hindering the sound development of global human rights cause.</p> <p> The U.S. government should immediately stop fabricating the so-called Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and concentrate its energies on facing up to and improving its own human rights situation.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

Should the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which had been built upon the premise of countering the Soviet superpower, also become history with the demise of its raison d'être? Some pondered. But still, a host of politicians from NATO member states cautioned against its abolishment and argued that, even after the Soviet Union collapsed, the need to "preserve the strategic balance in Europe" still remained. It was with the belief of swapping Europe's strategic autonomy with the ostensible "strategic balance" that NATO offered, a bygone concept from the Cold War-era reemerged and eventually widened its scope in a new century, and instead of shrinking or fading away it has instead expanded, incorporating more and more Central and Eastern European nations into its membership.</p> <p> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>NATO, Asian edition?</strong></span></p> <p> NATO's ambition and appetite have never been just confined to the Trans-Atlantic, as hardly had the Iron Curtain ceased to exist when NATO began to involve itself in wars of regime-change and invasions into Iraq and Afghanistan. In recent years the Western military alliance has also been rising in strength at an alarming rate, spreading its tentacles further to reach regions in Asia. High-level officials from Japan, South Korea, India, and Australia (with the latter, strictly speaking, simply being a nation that happens to be adjacent to Asia), among others, all being non-NATO states, and have long been frequently invited to join NATO meetings (including the one that was held earlier this month), at which NATO has spared no efforts to exercise its "long-arm jurisdiction" over issues such as the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.</p> <p> Since the simmering tension between Russia and Ukraine (the latter has been keen to join NATO despite the former's fierce objection) escalated into a deadly war, Washington, the de facto leader of NATO, has grown increasingly active in preaching about the alliance's significance. Not only have senior US officials turned their global visits into opportunities for the special promotion of NATO, but they have also repeatedly cited the so-called "China threat" and "Ukraine lesson" as excuses to urge military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region to be further cemented and bolstered. In a flurry of meetings and phone calls after the eruption of the Ukraine conflict, US president Joe Biden praised the "supportive" role of the Quad, an alliance between the US, India, Japan, and Australia, while reassuring the bloc's partners of Washington's commitment to supporting Australia with nuclear submarines and other advanced weaponry (such as hypersonic weapons) under AUKUS, a trilateral pact between the US, UK, and Australia.</p> <p> Whatever intentions Washington may harbor—whether integrating more Asian nations into the already loaded roster of the NATO alliance, or duplicating and nurturing more NATO replica or quasi-NATO intergovernmental organizations around the world—they will surely be equally NA(o)TO-rious and hazardous, both militarily and economically.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0415/FOREIGN202204151645000493572392184.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 684px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Cold War schemer Cartoon: Xu Zihe/GT</em></p> <p> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>A security mirage</strong></span></p> <p> To begin with, Washington's attempts to build a NATO replica organization—or, as many are calling it, an "Asian NATO"—will only serve to sabotage regional security and stability instead of "promoting" these goals.</p> <p> Through bilateral security treaties and multilateral defense alliances like the Quad and AUKUS, Washington has for years laboriously weaved its so called Indo-Pacific "collective defense web" into something akin to that of NATO, all at the expense of the common peace and stability shared by the entire region.</p> <p> But the idea of seeking "collective security" through "collective defense" doesn't hold water because Washington's strategy by nature is hostile and "coercive," which is exactly what Barry Blechman has written and argued, an American scholar focusing on nuclear disarmament, in his 2020 book <em>Military Coercion and US Foreign Policy</em>.</p> <p> Holding the banner of bloc politics and power politics, the US has relentlessly borrowed coercive and hegemonic tactics from its Cold War toolbox: stationing its omnipresent troops, deploying defensive systems, conducting joint naval exercises, and selling lethal weapons. All of these tactics, however, only serve to create a mirage of security, one that is parochial, unsustainable and can fail at any time (As Blechman pointed out, during the post-Cold War period US efforts to coerce other states failed as often as they succeeded).</p> <p> Take the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula as an example. Washington has always acted as the major player on the issue, and with its perilous moves, the US has sometimes grabbed the limelight away from even the ROK and DPRK themselves. In 2016, Washington announced that it would deploy THAAD, an anti-ballistic missile defense system, in South Korea, against vehement protests from countries within the region and from South Koreans. This omnipotent but unnecessary defense system was combined with a bombardment of sanctions and unrelenting joint military exercises. This shows that Washington has utilized every coercive device at its disposal despite the crisis having become even more convoluted and insoluble in recent years.</p> <p> Washington's military presence in the region has not only given rise to on-and-off tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but the US army itself has also been muddling the otherwise pacific and stable state of the region. Its spy planes have continued hovering and buzzing over sensitive waters, its ships and vessels have continued cruising in an often provocative manner, and one of its nuclear submarines was met with a collision in the South China Sea.</p> <p> Setting NATO as an exemplar, Washington is bent on constructing a hostile and turbulent climate, where any sense of security and stability is exclusive to only those nations living under its military umbrella. The ongoing Ukraine conflict has offered the world a wake-up call that NATO's eastern expansion and growing coercion is no solution for peace, on the contrary, it was only the prelude to a shattered peace and a disrupted "strategic balance" in Europe. This scenario is exactly what the nations in Asia should act to prevent. For the Asia-Pacific region, an "Asian NATO," even in its embryonic form, will be destined to heighten military risks, create more turmoil, and risk draging the entire region into Washington's insatiable gambit for geopolitical clout and hegemony.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0415/FOREIGN202204151653000362877940939.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 540px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Australian doublespeak Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</em></p> <p> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>A lose-lose trap</strong></span></p> <p> For years, China's peaceful rise and its dynamic trade ties with countries in Asia and beyond have become a thorn in Washington's side. Under the disguise of its "overarching" Indo-Pacific strategy, the US is utilizing military alliances to kidnap economic ties in the region, creating a lose-lose trap that no nation, except the US, wants to see.</p> <p> The souring China-Australia relationship is the perfect case study of how Washington's bloc politics can take a toll on bilateral relations—and economic ties in particular—in the region of Asia and beyond.</p> <p> China stands as Australia's largest trading partner, having imported approximately USD 164.8 billion worth of Australian goods last year, according to statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China. By comparison, the US imported only around USD 12.5 billion worth of goods from Australia in 2021.</p> <p> With Australia's trade axis leaning clearly towards one direction, Aussie leaders are still somehow convinced of the merits in shifting their foreign policies in another direction. Since the second half of 2020, Australia has joined Washington's call to smear China with baseless accusations, interfere in China's domestic affairs, and hype up the so-called "China threat," all against growing domestic concerns raised in Australia's frenzied anti-China rhetoric, stoked on by the US. This may fray the China-Australia relationship, one that Scott Morrison, Australian prime minister, has acknowledged as "valuable."</p> <p> A possible Asian NATO may reflect part of Washington's efforts to resuscitate its "Pivot to Asia" strategy, but Asian nations' common interests have never revolved around the US: they remain deeply intertwined and deeply rooted in Asia.</p> <p> Vibrant regional intergovernmental organizations in Asia like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), together with promising free trade agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which consists of the 10 members in ASEAN, plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, can serve as a strong indication that peace and development are still being prioritized and cherished and that multilateralism and cooperation can still prevail over bloc politics and confrontation.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0415/FOREIGN202204151650000238303445243.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 592px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>(Cartoon by Ma Hongliang)</em></p> <p> The world is not a land divided by different ideological lines or carved by different camps, awaiting Washington and the US military's alliances to conquer or deter enemies. In times of conflict and turmoil, we should all do more to cherish peace, a peace that is consolidated through common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security rather than sustained by pressure politics or Cold War-like power equilibriums. An "Asian NATO," by its nature, goes against the peace as we know it and will inevitably impair the stability and prosperity of the region. If anything, it is beneficial—only for its architect, the US itself.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> Japan is being extremely selfish and irresponsible by willfully clinging to its decision to release nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean in disregard of the strong opposition of the international community.</p> <p> Its despicable act constitutes gross infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of its neighboring countries, severe breach of international justice and its obligations under international law, and major threat to the marine environment and the right to health of people around the world.</p> <p> On April 13, 2021, the Japanese government unilaterally decided to dump a massive amount of nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) into the ocean despite doubts and opposition from home and abroad.</p> <p> One year has passed since Japan announced the erroneous decision and the country still hasn’t realized how terrible a mistake it is. According to a plan recently released by TEPCO for the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water generated by Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the country will soon begin official preparations for the release of the contaminated water and plans to begin long-term discharge of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean in the spring of 2023.</p> <p> While Japan opted for the discharge of the contaminated water into the ocean, an option with the least economic cost to itself, it posed the biggest environmental health and safety risk to the world. What an act of selfish calculation!</p> <p> Data from TEPCO showed that the contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear accident still contains many kinds of radionuclides with a long half-life even after secondary treatment.</p> <p> Japan plans to release more than one million tons of nuclear-contaminated water over a period of 30 years. The amount it intends to discharge, the duration of the release, the sea area covered, and potential risks that can be generated by the activity are all unprecedented.</p> <p> The decision has aroused deep concerns and strong opposition from all sectors of society even at home. About 180,000 people in Japan recently signed a petition against the decision to dump nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. Several organizations in Japan, including the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, have reiterated their opposition to the decision.</p> <p> According to an article published on Fukushima Minpo, a newspaper based in Fukushima prefecture of Japan, the Japanese government should respect the opinions of its citizens, listen to the voices of local residents, and terminate the plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean.</p> <p> As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, Japan has knowingly breached its obligations under international law.</p> <p> It didn’t conduct full consultation with its neighboring countries and other stakeholders before announcing its decision to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. After its announcement of the decision, many countries, including China, South Korea, Russia, and the Philippines, as well as relevant international institutions, have expressed concerns over the issue and raised doubts and concerns with the Japanese side over the legitimacy of the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, the rationality of the discharge plan, the credibility of data about the nuclear contaminated water and the reliability of the equipment to purify the nuclear-contaminated water.</p> <p> However, to this day, Japan has yet to give a full and credible explanation for its decision and serious responses to relevant doubts and concerns.</p> <p> People in Japan's neighboring countries and countries on the Pacific Rim have rights to health and life as well as the environment. Japan, on the other hand, wants to make short-term money at the expense of these rights.</p> <p> The United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council released a report urging that the Japanese government should face up to its responsibility for the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water.</p> <p> In a joint statement, U.N. human rights experts said that Japan’s decision to release contaminated water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean is “particularly disappointing” and “very concerning”.</p> <p> “The release of one million tons of contaminated water into the marine environment imposes considerable risks to the full enjoyment of human rights of concerned populations in and beyond the borders of Japan,” they said in the joint statement.</p> <p> The international community has frequently expressed voices of justice, such as “The Pacific is not a dumping ground for radioactive waste water” and “keep our Pacific nuclear-free”. However, Japan has turned a deaf ear to all of them.</p> <p> In this February, a technical working group of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Japan for the first time and raised many questions to the Japanese side about its controversial plan to release radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. Evaluation of the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima nuclear power plant is still in progress.</p> <p> Surprisingly, Japan has not only ignored the concerns of various parties over the discharge of its nuclear-contaminated wastewater, but preset results for the evaluation conducted by the IAEA technical working group. The country repeatedly concealed information and covered up the truth.</p> <p> When doubts about its decision to dump radioactive water into the ocean poured in, the country made no attempt to reflect on the legitimacy of the decision and correct its mistake, but blamed those who doubted its decision for damaging its reputation.</p> <p> The Japanese side should know that no matter what it does to whitewash the plan to release the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, it would only increase the international community’s concerns.</p> <p> The disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water is never Japan’s private matter. Instead, it bears on the marine environment and public health of the whole world.</p> <p> Japan should pay careful attention to and respond to the concerns of its neighboring countries and other members of the international community, stop pushing forward with preparations for the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, and withdraw its erroneous decision, so as to avoid further damage to its credibility.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> U.S. President Joe Biden recently delivered a speech full of the Cold War mentality in Warsaw, capital of Poland. In his speech, Biden spent considerable time discussing the victory of Western countries, including the U.S. in the Cold War and tried to play up ideological confrontation, attempting to show the world the so-called solidarity between the U.S. and its allies and the deterrent effect of the economic sanctions and military deployment of the “Western world”.</p> <p> U.S. President talked about practically everything in his speech, but only failed to mention how to stop the war and realize peace, indicating that certain U.S. politicians have never abandoned their Cold War mentality even though the Cold War ended more than 30 years ago, some media outlets pointed out.</p> <p> The Russia-Ukraine tensions have evolved into a war exactly as a pernicious consequence of America’s sticking to the Cold War mentality and continuously pushing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) eastward.</p> <p> According to British scholar Martin Jacques, the U.S.’s post-1991 hubris resulted in two disastrous decisions: to remake the world in its own image; and to treat Russia as a defeated nation.</p> <p> The U.S. has promoted NATO’s enlargement through five rounds of eastward expansion, leading to seriously imbalanced regional security. As a result, Ukraine, which should have been the bridge of communication between the East and the West, was gradually transformed into an outpost for major powers confrontation.</p> <p> George Kennan, former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, pointed out that the decision to expand NATO up to Russia’s borders “would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era” and may be expected to “restore the atmosphere of the Cold War to East-West relations”.</p> <p> Today, as Ukraine remains mired in turmoil and the embers of conflict rekindle on the European continent, facts prove again that the Cold War mentality is the greatest threat to global peace and stability.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. has pursued its geopolitical goal with a Cold War mentality, rather than fostering peace negotiations. The country, which believes that it can exploit the Ukraine crisis to provoke ideological confrontation and deepen Europe’s dependence on America, has been enthusiastically escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, fanning the flames of discord, and forcing other countries into taking sides.</p> <p> Besides taking aim at Russia, the U.S. has also continued to propagate disinformation to defame China and misrepresented China’s responsible stance on the Ukraine issue: promoting dialogue and peace talks.</p> <p> As Iliya Kusa, a political analyst with the Ukrainian Institute of the Future, pointed out, China has played a constructive role in the Ukraine crisis, while the U.S. is still focusing its attention on what it can do to weaken China.</p> <p> Although the U.S. has frequently claimed that it does not seek a “new Cold War”, the country has taken advantage of any chance to suppress China and Russia. Regarding the two countries as its top strategic competitors, it has made arrangements to gain at their expense.</p> <p> Obviously, America’s insistence on the outdated Cold War mentality is the root cause of the escalation of regional and global security tensions.</p> <p> “I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe, but it’s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it’s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing,” said Biden during his visit to Europe. The remarks exposed the true colors of the U.S., a hypocrite that stops at nothing to create crises, shift its burden of crises onto others, and utilize crises to maintain its hegemony.</p> <p> As the world’s major exporter of natural gas and oil, the U.S. can certainly put on sanctified airs and understate the consequences of obstructing the supply of Russian natural gas, for it does not have to suffer the consequences.</p> <p> Though the U.S. promised to ensure supply of natural gas to Europe, its allies, after learning how unreliable and untrustworthy it can be from lessons in the past, have deep concerns over its strategic purpose behind the promise.</p> <p> The origin of the Russia-Ukraine conflict lies in NATO, and Europe would only get hurt if it waded into muddy water with the U.S., noted Klaus Ernst, a senior member of the German federal parliament.</p> <p> The Ukraine crisis has helped various sides see clearer how harmful the Cold War mentality can be. As a well-known quote from Albert Einstein goes, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”</p> <p> Since the deep-seated Cold War mentality of the U.S. is the root cause of the Ukraine crisis, the country will only make it more difficult to solve problems for the current crisis as long as it still sticks to the mentality.</p> <p> As a Chinese saying goes, “He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off.” In order to settle the Ukraine crisis, relevant countries must discard the Cold War mentality, the attempt to maintain their own security at the cost of others’ security, and the practice of pursuing regional security by expanding military blocs. Instead, they should seek the establishment of a balanced, effective, and sustainable European security mechanism through dialogues and negotiations on the basis of attaching importance to and respecting the legitimate security concerns of various countries.</p> <p> The U.S. needs to realize sooner rather than later that the Cold War is over, and a “new Cold War” will not get any support.</p> <p> The world wants peace, justice, and cooperation, rather than war, hegemony, and confrontation. If the U.S. truly wants to de-escalate the tensions between Russia and Ukraine, it should face its responsibility for the current situation in Ukraine, stop pursuing selfish gains from the crisis, respond to the legitimate concerns of all parties, and take practical steps toward world peace.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

He also shared his views on how to settle the Ukraine crisis under the current circumstances.</p> <p> When President Xi paid a historic visit to the EU headquarters in March 2014, he suggested that China and Europe work together to foster a China-EU partnership for peace, growth, reform and civilization, which has endowed the China-Europe comprehensive strategic partnership with new connotations.</p> <p> This vision remains unchanged today and is of practical significance under the current circumstances. As the world has entered a period of new turbulence and transformation, China and the EU should offset uncertainties in the international landscape with the stability of China-EU relations, deepen economic globalization through open cooperation, and meet global challenges through solidarity and collaboration.</p> <p> China and the EU are two major independent forces that share broad strategic consensus and common interests. Dialogue and cooperation remain the mainstream of China-EU relations, and mutual benefit is the keynote of China-EU cooperation. It's a consensus between the two sides that they need peace, multilateralism and dialogue, instead of war, unilateralism, and confrontation.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0407/FOREIGN202204070905000303109393821.jpg" style="width: 863px; height: 575px;" /></p> <p> <em>Cooking utensils to be exported to the European and American markets are being assembled at a workshop of the Anhui Hualing Kitchen Equipment Co., Ltd. in Ma'anshan, east China's Anhui province, April 1, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Wang Wensheng)</em></p> <p> China and the EU should perceive their relations from broader strategic and more profound historical perspectives. Xi said they should take the lead in defending the international system with the UN at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and jointly reject the resurrection of rival-bloc mentality and oppose attempts at a new Cold War, with a view to maintaining world peace and stability.</p> <p> Xi called on the EU to form its own perception of China, adopt an independent China policy, and work with China to promote the steady and sustained growth of China-EU relations and to add stabilizing factors to a turbulent world.</p> <p> China and the EU are important trading partners of each other. They carry out cooperation in a wide range of fields and their interests are interwoven.</p> <p> China has remained the largest trading partner of the EU for two consecutive years, and the trade volume between the two sides reached a record high of more than $800 billion last year. The trade structure between them is constantly optimized, with prominent growth observed in aerospace, biology, optoelectronics, and electronics.</p> <p> China's solid efforts to deepen reform and expand opening up have created important opportunities for European business investment. The China-EU agreement on geographical indications has further facilitated bilateral trade, and the China-Europe freight trains are also contributing to the stability of the international industrial and supply chains.</p> <p> As two major economies, China and the EU enjoy strong resilience and huge potential in economic and trade cooperation. The cooperation between them is conducive to not only their own development, but also the economic recovery of the world.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0407/FOREIGN202204070903000508526661905.jpg" style="width: 862px; height: 601px;" /></p> <p> <em>A freight train bound for Madrid, Spain is ready to depart from Yiwu, east China's Zhejiang province, April 1, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Gong Xianming)</em></p> <p> Facing increasing global challenges, China and the EU need to follow true multilateralism and advocate a vision of global governance featuring the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.</p> <p> From jointly making important contributions to the reaching of the Paris Agreement to leading cooperation on biodiversity, and from offering mutual assistance in the fight against COVID-19 to further enhancing anti-pandemic cooperation for narrowing the global immunity gap, China and the EU enjoy a solid foundation in strengthening cooperation.</p> <p> China welcomes the EU's support for and participation in the Global Development Initiative. The two sides' efforts to promote world peace, economic growth and common prosperity will contribute wisdom and strength to improving global governance.</p> <p> Concerning regional and global peace and stability, the situation in Ukraine is receiving high attention from the international society. During the meeting with President Michel and President von der Leyen, President Xi called on the global community to encourage peace talks, prevent a humanitarian crisis on a bigger scale, foster lasting peace in Europe and the Eurasian continent, and prevent the regional conflict from magnifying. His proposals fully demonstrated China's major responsibility to always stand on the right side of history and play a constructive role in safeguarding world peace and the common interests of mankind.</p> <p> Promoting peace talks, keeping the situation under control, preventing larger-scale humanitarian crisis and spillover of the Ukraine crisis are a consensus reached between China and the EU. Both of the two sides are unwilling to see the world divided, and oppose a new Cold War in any form.</p> <p> There is no conflict of fundamental interests between China and the EU. Cooperation far outweighs competition, and consensus far outweighs disagreement. The two sides should maintain their mutual understanding, and adhere to mutual trust, dialogues and cooperation for win-win results, so as to make constant progress of China-EU relations, and make their contributions to world peace and development as two major forces, big markets and great civilizations.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> <strong>--Washington's relentless fanning the flames, shirking of responsibilities, and throwing of dirt have cast an ominous shadow on any possible de-escalation.</strong></p> <p> <strong>--Washington is&nbsp;wilfully&nbsp;driving the train of Ukraine's future not toward peace, but all speed ahead into a future riddled with more uncertainties and untold suffering.</strong></p> <p> In his high-stakes trip to Poland last week, US president Joe Biden was scheduled to meet with leaders from Europe to discuss the response to the "humanitarian and human rights crisis" arising from the over month-long Russia-Ukraine conflict. At least that was what a White House statement prior to Biden's visit read.</p> <p> The response—it turned out—was a cascade of personal attacks targeting Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, together with an insinuation that the US would respond "in kind" if chemical weapons were deployed, and backtracking from his campaign promise to only use the US nuclear arsenal as a defensive last resort.</p> <p> His flabbergasting remarks, which were described by many as a "gaffe," have drawn harsh criticism both at home and abroad. James Freeman, a Wall Street Journal columnist, half-jokingly commented that Americans would all be much safer if their president "would make greater use of prepared statements on subjects such as, for example, weapons of mass destruction." Even former US President Donald Trump, who is famous for his imprudent and often impromptu political language, slammed his successor's rhetoric as provocative.</p> <p> European leaders have also expressed their deep concerns over Biden's fiery speech while distancing themselves from it. French President Emmanuel Macron, who in the past months had been busy mediating between Russia and Ukraine, expressed that such inflammatory rhetoric went against the joint efforts for a ceasefire and could possibly throw future negotiations into jeopardy.</p> <p> Despite that high-level US officials have come forward several times to clarify that Washington harbored no intentions of using chemical weapons and sought no regime change in Russia, the international community, including American allies, has grown increasingly wary and confused with Washington's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p> <p> Is the US willing to help allay the tensions and deescalate the situation? Or is it determined to fuel the flames and incite even fiercer confrontations? Seen from Washington's inflammatory rhetoric and actions, it has apparently chosen the latter course.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0402/FOREIGN202204021535000071060133728.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 592px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>(Cartoon by Ma Hongliang)</em></p> <p> <strong>Quelling fires with fuel</strong></p> <p> Since the Ukraine conflict broke out over a month ago, the US has deployed over 12,000 troops to the periphery of Ukraine and pledged to send more armed forces to Eastern Europe. This week, when a knifes-edge peace talk was held between Russia and Ukraine, the general in charge of American forces in Europe hinted that the US would still need more troops in the region even after the Russia-Ukraine conflict begins to wane.</p> <p> At a time when NATO's expansion, together with its defense budget hikes and military build-ups, served as a prelude to the seemingly irreconcilable Ukraine crisis, Washington has intended to reinforce the vicious circle, paving the way for yet more budget hikes, more military build-ups to maintain its extreme pressure on Russia that lies at the root of the crisis.</p> <p> <em>[Related Reading:<a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0330/c90000-10077519.html" target="_blank"><u> Cold War-minded U.S. eyes more military spending to sustain hegemony amid geopolitical tensions</u></a>]</em></p> <p> As Tulsi Gabbard, a former US Congresswoman who once served in Iraq sharply and correctly pointed out, the crisis and suffering "could have easily been avoided if the Biden administration and NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border."</p> <p> In a recent interview on Fox News, Gabbard reiterated her belief that Washington had purposely, as it always did, fanned the flames of the conflict instead of helping to mollify it. "The strategy and tactics are the same as our (America's) previous regime change wars: inflicting severe hardship and suffering on the population in order to incite revolt and chaos," she highlighted.</p> <p> Washington has posed as an arbitrator, a peacekeeper in the Ukraine crisis, and a ballast of stability and security in Europe, but it has failed to acknowledge the culpable roles it played in the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the protracted instability of the region.</p> <p> NATO's five waves of expansion, American and NATO leaders' luring Ukraine into the military alliance, together with NATO's growing military budgets and deployment of troops and defense systems near Russia's doorstep, have not only undermined the strategic autonomy of Europe, enticed paranoia and an unnecessary arms race (even a nuclear one) around the entire world, but also have given rise to disastrous scenarios like the Ukraine crisis that the US and NATO had purported to wish to prevent.</p> <p> The US branded NATO as a shield, a stabilizer, as well as an umbrella, but it could never erase the military alliance's notorious record of unjustified bombings in Yugoslavia or its inglorious involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.</p> <p> The US may feel complacent about a rare moment of unity among NATO member states, including the unparalleled military and economic clout it can wield, but as long as the crux of the crisis remains—Washington and NATO's overreaching and bellicose stance—then conflicts and suffering will persist. The US cannot expect to put up the fire with fuel.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0402/FOREIGN202204021538000249297887632.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 684px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Unmasking The Superpower: Vampires in the war Illustration: Xu Zihe/GT</em></p> <p> <strong>Fishing in troubled waters</strong></p> <p> "People say the Pentagon does not have a strategy. They are wrong. The Pentagon does have a strategy. It is 'Don't interrupt the money flow, add to it,'" as so famously said by John Boyd, a former Pentagon consultant and military strategist during the second half of the last century.</p> <p> America's motto of feeding on turmoil and profiting from conflicts, which was upheld during the Persian Gulf War, America's invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and its military interventions in Syria and Libya, etc., is still enshrined in the heart of the US military to this day and couldn't be more relevant and explanatory as regards Washington's stance on Ukraine.</p> <p> The US may continue complaining about surging oil prices, but it can't deny that it is <em>the </em>nation—probably the sole nation—standing to gain from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p> <p> One needs to look no further than Wall Street. Even though the US market has, overall, ebbed and flowed with the developments of the Ukraine conflict, its defense stocks have risen significantly, especially upon hearing the news that Germany, along with other NATO member states, would massively hike their defense budgets, increases Washington had been eager to see for years.</p> <p> Axon Enterprise, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, coupled with other US aerospace and weapons manufacturers, have seen strong performances and rosy outlooks with the unfolding Ukraine conflict. Lockheed Martin, the world's largest weapons manufacturer, registered a 25 percent increase since the beginning of this year. Boeing, which invests heavily in the defense industry, has predicted a 31 percent 12-month upside potential.</p> <p> <em>[Related Reading: <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0331/c90000-10078284.html" target="_blank"><u>U.S. arms companies make big fortune amid Russia-Ukraine conflict</u></a>]</em></p> <p> Wherever the Russia-Ukraine conflict may go, America's defense giants will undeniably make big bucks for the financial elites, much like they always do when America's war machine is ratcheted up globally, or when the US is busy handing over lethal weapons to intensify the tragedies of the Middle East or spell more trouble in the Asia-Pacific region.</p> <p> Washington may again gamble on a geopolitical endgame from which it has little to lose and much to gain, but with its dangerous and reckless words and deeds, it has also dragged Ukraine and Russia, with the latter being a nuclear power, toward the cliff of a more brutal confrontation, a scenario where there is no turning back.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0402/FOREIGN202204021538000574978287334.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 592px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>(Cartoon by Ma Hongliang)</em></p> <p> <strong>Throwing dirt</strong></p> <p> American politicians and media outlets, almost in tandem with the Ukraine conflict, have continued circulating and spewing out anti-China disinformation that is simply fake.</p> <p> Starting earlier last month, the New York Times, joined by other mainstream media outlets, falsely claimed that Chinese officials had "known" beforehand about Russia's plans for the conflict. Their evidence? An unsubstantiated "Western intelligence report." Their source? Several unnamed officials. Apparently, America's disinformation machine has never once run out of steam with the same fuel.</p> <p> Less than two weeks later, American media outlets cooked up something richer and even more fantastical. This time, they cited a US intelligence official who suggested that China "has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance," as CNN reported. To even consider giving an official response to such a pure fabrication was not worth the time. Yet, Chinese officials have on multiple occasions shown their utmost patience in debunking the flagrant and sinister lies of the Americans.</p> <p> Then, last month, the New York Times published a preposterous analytical article headlined "China Takes a Back Seat in International Diplomacy Over Ukraine," in which it suggested that "China has repeatedly called for peace talks in Ukraine," while adding that "What it has not done is press Russia to negotiate." It is somewhat of a relief to see that the Times used the word "negotiate" instead of "sanction." But their tone seems to suggest that China somehow has a greater ability to sway Russia or press the "stop" button on the conflict than either the US and most of its Western allies combined might have.</p> <p> In the American media's warped narratives on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US is whitewashed as a mediator, a peacekeeper, and a savior who protects the vulnerable from utter despair, while China is blackwashed as the nation that "stands aloof," "waits and sees," and hesitates to "act."</p> <p> But in reality, China's stance on Ukraine has been consistent and clear-cut from the outset: it seeks to promote peace talks rather than carry out indiscriminate sanctions or set up obstacles for possible de-escalation; it acts to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine instead of supplying lethal weapons; it strives to foster lasting peace in Europe and the Eurasian continent rather than get stuck in the Cold War mentality and remain obsessed with expanding geopolitical clouts and forging military alliances.</p> <p> On the contrary, America's sanctions stick and bellicose rhetoric are only worsening the situation, narrowing the window for a possible clawback from escalation, and steering Ukraine and Russia away from the negotiating table.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0402/FOREIGN202204021539000310536779369.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 540px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Peace talks Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</em></p> <p> ***</p> <p> As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its seventh week, the international community is counting on the hard-won yet fragile peace talks between the two sides. But Washington's relentless fanning the flames, shirking of responsibilities, and throwing of dirt have cast an ominous shadow on any possible de-escalation. As the <em>driver </em>that caused multiple <em>train wrecks</em> in the past, Washington is wilfully driving the train of Ukraine's future not toward peace, but all speed ahead into a future riddled with more uncertainties and untold suffering.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The U.S.-controlled biological laboratories in Ukraine have recently become a focal point of the international society as the fallout of the news continues.</p> <p> Russia accused the U.S. of violating the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in Ukraine, while the U.S. denied it and claimed it was based on fabricated evidence given by the Kremlin.</p> <p> It is no secret that the U.S. hosts the most bio-military activities in the world, and is the only country that opposes the establishment of a verification mechanism for the BWC.</p> <p> The activities of U.S. biological laboratories matter to the security of global biological safety. However, the White House's response to this grave worry has been denial. It has never offered any valuable or convincing information. Such perfunctory and arrogant response has further exacerbated worldwide society's concerns about the safety of U.S. bio-military actions.</p> <p> Overseas bio-military activities are a tradition of the U.S. After the end of the Cold War, the country initiated the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program promoted by Richard Lugar and other U.S. senators. The White House claimed that the Soviet Union would be the first to "benefit" from the program, and then the benefits would expand to other parts of the world. Later, hundreds of laboratories were established under the CTR program.</p> <p> The program, a gigantic bio-military empire, never ceased to cause scandals. Some of the labs reported leakage of highly dangerous pathogens that led to outbreaks of strange diseases, and some collected biological samples of local residents and transferred the samples to the U.S. and its allies for "studies." Many of these labs were poorly managed. Personnel sent by the U.S. Department of Defense had extraterritoriality and diplomatic immunity, so they could always get away with crimes at these labs.</p> <p> After the U.S.-controlled bio-labs in Ukraine were exposed, the White House tried to vindicate itself with some materials. However, the U.S. doesn't have an innocent history of the development and employment of biological weapons at all.</p> <p> The U.S. once covered up Shiro Ishii, director of the notorious Japanese Army Unit 731, and other war criminals, so as to make them develop biological weapons for itself. In the Korean War, the U.S. military launched undifferentiated germ warfare against Chinese and Korean forces and even civilians. In Vietnam, the U.S. military used the highly toxic Agent Orange on the battleground, killing and disabling millions of Vietnamese. The U.S. even forced thousands of soldiers into biological medicine tests. These are all evidence of the U.S. poisoning the world.</p> <p> Former Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari of Indonesia once shut down the lab of the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit-2 during her term. She said the lab didn't make any contribution to Indonesia's capability in coping with biological threats and the studies were not submitted to the Indonesian government. She remarked that establishing laboratories on the territory of an independent country is a kind of colonialism.</p> <p> The U.S. always takes "cooperating to reduce biological safety risks" as an excuse. However, only the U.S. itself knows whether it is really cooperating and whether it is reducing or increasing the risks.</p> <p> Recently, a large demonstration was staged in South Korea, requesting the shutdown of U.S. military biological labs established in the country and calling for immediate investigations into these labs. The outrage of the South Koreans came from the United States Forces Korea, which has ignored South Korean laws and regulations and sent poisonous substances to South Korea, including Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis. These labs have caused frequent safety accidents, posing huge threats to the lives of South Koreans. Some South Koreans said that the U.S. bio-labs were built for American interests, and are a misfortune for the countries where they are built.</p> <p> The international society has every reason to know what the U.S. has done. In recent years, the United States has arbitrarily requested that biological weapons verifications be launched in other countries, wielding the big stick of sanctions and even launching military invasions. However, it is ironic that the U.S. is always tolerant of itself and strict with others. It's either arrogantly requesting other countries to stay out of its biological weapon business, or passing the buck to other countries, or just showing its colors and unjustly blaming other countries for "disseminating fake information."</p> <p> Faced with the accusation from Russia this time, the White House is even acting as a "victim." Such typical American double standard once again exposed the hegemonic thinking of the U.S. It is a huge insult to the countries and people that have been poisoned by U.S. bio-military activities, and is irresponsible to the whole world.</p> <p> As a response to the Russian accusation and the concerns of the international society, the U.S. should take its responsibility, vindicate itself and stop opposing the establishment of a verification mechanism for the BWC. .The country can never prove itself innocent of hegemony. Only by following international rules and accepting investigations can it give a clear explanation to the world, and that's what is supposed to be done by a major country.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People's Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)&nbsp;</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

Security Council approval and lasted for 78 days.</p> <p> NATO’s war crime will never be forgotten by the Serbians, the Chinese, or the people in the rest of the world.</p> <p> The U.S. and the NATO have waged a number of wars in the past decades, tearing countries and regions in different parts of the world apart. These wars demonstrated to all peace-loving people around the globe that the U.S., which is obsessed with Cold War mentality, as well as the U.S.-led NATO, is the biggest source of turbulences in the world.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the NATO has purported to be a guardian of peace, order and morality.. It positions itself as an ultimate decision-maker of international affairs, provokes confrontation, and threatens other countries to pick a side with sanctions, so as to reach its geostrategic goals.</p> <p> However, it's self-evident who initiated the most ferocious international security conflict in the post-Cold War era. An international political analyst believes that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a result of U.S. conspiracies and interference.</p> <p> According to a political dignitary, the conflict could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from among its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would increase regional instability.</p> <p> The arbitrary decision of the U.S.-led NATO to move its so-called line of defense for collective security to the borders of Russia and Ukraine has directly turned down the opportunity to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict through negotiations and led to a war between the two countries.</p> <p> "We say we're a peaceful nation. Why do our leaders always keep us at war?" That's a very good question once raised by The Washington Post in one of its articles.</p> <p> The U.S. always talks about peace, but it is indeed marching along the opposite path - wars. It's a country that's addicted to wars, and the American history is exactly a history of wars, which is a fact recognized by the international society. It is indicated by the photos posted by many people on social media of how their countries look like after U.S. bombings, as well as the miserable stories of themselves and their families in the wars launched by the U.S.</p> <p> According to U.S. website War History Online, America has been at war 93 percent of the time since it was founded in 1776. After the World War II, Uncle Sam extended the tentacles of interference to the whole world, and became even more unscrupulous after the Cold War ended. A study by professor Monica Duffy Toft of international politics at Tufts University showed that the U.S. was engaged in 46 military interventions from 1948 to 1991, and the number more than quadrupled to 188 between 1992 and 2017. It's fair to say that there was a trace of the country in almost every conflict that happened.</p> <p> The U.S.-based magazine Foreign Policy once pointed out that the U.S. may feel an impulse to start a foreign war as long as it is deemed necessary, and as for the terrible humanitarian disasters resulting from these foreign wars, they will be borne by others.</p> <p> American historian Alan Brinkley recorded in the book American History that during the Vietnam War, the U.S. military carpet-bombed Vietnamese villages, tore down buildings with bulldozers, and wiped out fields and forests with chemical agents, killing two million civilians and forced over three million refugees to flee their homes.</p> <p> Furthermore, the U.S.-led NATO employed depleted uranium weapons, which are banned by international treaties, in bombing Yugoslavia, and caused long-term negative impacts on Serbia's environment and people's health. Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. successively launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, leading to regional turbulences and spillover of security threats.</p> <p> According to Smithsonian, the official journal published by the Smithsonian Institution, the U.S. launched military actions in the name of "counter-terrorism" in around 40 percent of the countries on the globe after 2001. The Costs of War project at Brown University indicated that these so-called "counter-terrorism" wars have killed over 800,000 people and displaced more than 38 million. The refugee problem that has plagued Europe for years was indeed to a large extent caused by the warlike nature of the U.S.</p> <p> The U.S. has devolved into a destroyer, and Washington is obsessed with armed forces rather than building peace, according to Stephen Wertheim, Deputy Director of Research and Policy at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.</p> <p> Repeatedly provoking conflicts and wars, showing indifference to peace talks, and even trying to protract the conflict, the U.S. has fully revealed that to protect global and regional peace and stability is never a priority in its strategy. What matters most to the country is its dominance in the international landscape, especially in the so-called "superpower game."</p> <p> The above point is well explained by the Ukraine crisis: what makes the U.S.-led NATO contain Russia is the White House's intention to take dominance on the issue of European security.</p> <p> We live in the 21st century, but the U.S. is still reluctant to abandon the outdated zero-sum games. The warlike U.S. is the largest destroyer of international order, and is in no position to play a guardian of peace.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People's Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)&nbsp;</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

The outbreak of the Ukraine crisis has further complicated the international situation which has already been full of uncertainties.</p> <p> The evolution of the Ukraine crisis is something all peace-loving countries and people don’t want to see. The deteriorating situation has once again shown that state-to-state relations cannot advance to the stage of confrontation, and conflicts and confrontations are not in the interests of anyone. Peace and security are what the international community should treasure the most.</p> <p> At such a critical moment, certain Western countries, driven by their own selfish interests, have added fuel to the fire to escalate the Ukraine crisis while criticizing the just position of other countries that urge the settlement of the crisis through dialogue and negotiation. They even claimed that every country should think about what side of history they want to be on over the Ukraine issue. It was like “if you don’t listen to me, then you are on the wrong side of history”.</p> <p> While exposing the hegemonic mindset of certain Western countries, such remarks and acts of openly asking other countries to take sides are evidence of these countries’ failing to grasp the trend of history and standing on the right side of history.</p> <p> Countries that stand on the right side of history must support peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Whether they have promoted peace talks or incited confrontation, doused the fire or fanned the flames of war, pursued common interests or selfish gains, history will record justly the merits and demerits of countries’ choices regarding the Ukraine crisis.</p> <p> China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be fully observed, the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis must be supported.</p> <p> This is a judgment made independently based on the merits of the matter and the right choice based on a long-term perspective and the intention of safeguarding world peace.</p> <p> To resolve the Ukraine crisis, all sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace. The U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should also hold dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the crisis.</p> <p> China’s proposition, while helps avoid escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia, embodies the philosophy “harmony is the most valuable”, which has been valued by the Chinese nation since ancient times, and demonstrates China’s strong sense of responsibility as a major country.</p> <p> Countries that stand on the right side of history must promote global peace and development.</p> <p> Peace, development, cooperation, and win-win results are the irresistible trend of the times. Peoples of all countries long for peace and development. China stands for peace and opposes war, which is embedded in the country’s history and culture.</p> <p> As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible major country, China has always faithfully fulfilled its international obligations and played a constructive role in safeguarding world peace and stability.</p> <p> China has the best record as a major country when it comes to peace and security. It has never invaded other countries, launched proxy wars, sought spheres of influence or engaged in any military bloc confrontation.</p> <p> To resolve the Ukraine crisis, it is absolutely imperative to promote dialogue and negotiation between Russia and Ukraine, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and cease hostilities as soon as possible.</p> <p> China has been doing its best for world peace, and will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.</p> <p> Countries that stand on the right side of history must safeguard equity and justice. The prevailing trends toward a multi-polar world, economic globalization, and the democratization of international relations remain unchanged. Increasingly, international affairs need to be jointly handled by all countries through extensive consultation, while establishing international mechanism, abiding by international rules, and pursuing international justice have become a consensus among the majority of countries.</p> <p> China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations, adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.</p> <p> Ukraine’s sovereignty and security should be safeguarded; Russia’s legitimate security concerns should also be respected. Europe’s peace and stability should be defended, so should the peace and stability of other countries.</p> <p> Major countries in the world should respect each other, reject Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and gradually build balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for their regions and for the world, which is the long-term solution to the Ukraine crisis. China will be pleased to see equal-footed dialogue among the EU, Russia, the U.S. and NATO.</p> <p> What makes a major country a truly respected one is its responsibility and capability to advance and safeguard global peace.</p> <p> In this volatile and changing world, China has always upheld and practiced true multilateralism, and stood on the right side of history, the side of peace, cooperation, fairness, and justice, as well as the side of human progress.</p> <p> Time will prove that China’s proposition represents the right path toward realizing the lasting and peaceful development of the world and creating a more beautiful future for mankind.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Li Gang)</em></p> <p> The Omicron variant of COVID-19 is spreading fast globally. Some U.S. media outlets recently sighed in articles that the pandemic is "still killing 1,200 Americans a day," worrying there might be "another surge." However, in a cynical tone, they said the Chinese mainland the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) are having a "bad year", just to smear China's pandemic response policies and achievements, and even defame China's political system.</p> <p> Such a narrow and evil view is a total disregard of facts. It turns the pandemic into a tool and weapon out of ulterior political motives.</p> <p> Facing the pandemic unseen in a century, the Chinese government has always put the Chinese people and their lives in the first and highest place. It has tailored science-based and targeted pandemic control policies according to the spread of the pandemic and the features of the virus, so as to maximumly safeguard people's lives and health, maintain a normal pace of work and life, and ensure the safety of industrial and supply chains.</p> <p> China is in a leading position globally in economic development and pandemic control, which fully demonstrates the strong ability of the country to control the virus and the obvious advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p> <p> On the contrary, as the world's largest economy and a country that boasts rich and advanced medical resources, the U.S. has seen rounds of serious COVID-19 resurgence, setting new records in a number of indexes, such as newly confirmed cases, hospitalized cases and children's infections. Nearly a million people have died in the country because of the pandemic.</p> <p> The unscientific, unequal, and irresponsible pandemic response led by the White House, prejudices held by political parties, as well as the reckless dissemination of fake information have traumatized the credibility of the U.S. government, and the rights to life and health of Americans, whose trust in their government has been "bankrupt."</p> <p> This clearly shows who's the top scorer and who's the underachiever in terms of pandemic response.</p> <p> Facing the highly transmissible Omicron variant, the HKSAR experienced a drastic surge in newly confirmed cases and was put in a grave situation.</p> <p> At the critical moment, the HKSAR government acted responsibly and launched a tough battle to safeguard people's lives and health under the assistance from the Chinese central government.</p> <p> Expert teams and nucleic acid testing teams were quickly established and dispatched to Hong Kong. A Fire Eye Laboratory, nucleic acid testing vehicles, and quick testing kits were immediately put into use. The first makeshift hospital of Hong Kong was built within a week, and another six with 20,000 beds in less than a month. New waterways were constantly opened for material supply and freight trains were designated to carry assistance materials from the mainland to the HKSAR.</p> <p> The people in the Chinese mainland, sharing the concerns of their compatriots in Hong Kong, assisted the special administrative region with the fastest speed, highest intensity and widest coverage, to ensure the implementation of the assisting policies of the central government. It has significantly enhanced the Hong Kong citizens’ resolution and confidence in fighting and defeating the virus, and basically contained the rising trend of the pandemic in Hong Kong. The ongoing battle against the pandemic in Hong Kong vividly mirrors the institutional advantages of China.</p> <p> However, some U.S. media outlets are always making a fuss about the resurgence in Hong Kong, distorting the meaning of "dynamic zero-COVID approach." They said China should relax its pandemic control measures and choose to "coexist with the virus", but this only reflects their evil intentions.</p> <p> Hong Kong is a city with high population density and high passenger mobility, and it's also bothered by an aging society. "Laid-back" approaches will only make the virus spread faster there and seriously threaten the lives and health of the Hong Kong citizens, thus crushing the hope of restoring normal economic and social operation.</p> <p> The Guardians recently pointed out that "We all want the disruption and anxiety to stop, but we won’t achieve that with policies that pretend the pandemic is over when it isn’t. It said to stop the pandemic, we must learn to spot and contain worrying outbreaks.</p> <p> China's pandemic control practices fully prove that the "dynamic zero-COVID approach" is science-based, necessary, effective and feasible. It is something that must be done by a major country with more than 1.4 billion people, as well as an obligation of a responsible government and society. It puts into practice the people-first philosophy and contributes to the world's efforts to fight the pandemic.</p> <p> According to a recent poll published by Hong Kong-based think tank Bauhinia Institute, over 65 percent of the Hong Kong citizens believe that the "dynamic zero-COVID approach" is in line with the general interests of the Hong Kong society, and more than 80 percent are supportive of the goal raised by the expert team dispatched by the central government to reduce the numbers of deaths, critical cases and infections. The poll also indicated that over 80 percent of the Hong Kong citizens are more confident in defeating the virus because of the central government's assistance.</p> <p> After directing a documentary recording Wuhan's battle against the pandemic, British director Malcolm Clarke said he and his team have witnessed the invincible state strength of China during the pandemic. He said in China, the whole nation fights as one when it wants to achieve something, which is incredible when measured with Western standards.</p> <p> Over the past two years and more, China's institutional advantages and powerful state strength have withstood the test of the pandemic, and will keep contributing to the country's fight against the virus. China will build a solid wall of defense against COVID-19 with utmost confidence and achieve a final victory. The U.S. media and politicians that are always defaming China, sowing discord, mongering panic and singing the blues are destined to be disappointed again.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People's Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)&nbsp;</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

As tensions swiftly build up and the human toll continues climbing in the region of Eastern Europe, Washington has offered its <em>solutions </em>to the crisis: a joint "sanction" of Russia along with its allies and weapons supplies to Ukraine.</p> <p> With neither of these approaches seeming to have worked so far, unfortunately, the US has decided instead to shift blame onto other parties, spreading blatant falsehoods and disinformation targeting China, while insinuating that China hasn't done enough to address the crisis.</p> <p> And yet, such blame games won't do anything to help with the situation either.</p> <p> American media outlets, almost in tandem with the Ukraine crisis, have kept circulating and spewing anti-China disinformation that is simply fake. Starting earlier this month, the New York Times, joined by other mainstream media outlets, falsely claimed that Chinese officials had "known" beforehand the occurrence of the conflict. Their evidence? An unsubstantiated "Western intelligence report." Their source? Several unnamed officials. Apparently, America's disinformation machine has never once run out of steam with the same fuel.</p> <p> Less than two weeks later, American media outlets cooked up something richer and even more fantastical. This time, they cited a US intelligence official who suggested that China "has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance," as CNN reported. To even consider giving an official response to such a pure fabrication was not worth the time. Yet, Chinese officials have on multiple occasions shown their utmost patience in debunking the flagrant and sinister lies.</p> <p> <em>[Related Reading: <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0316/c90000-9971682.html" target="_blank"><u>U.S. can't cover up its responsibility for Ukraine crisis by spreading anti-China disinformation</u></a>]</em></p> <p> Then, this week, the New York Times published a preposterous analytical article headlined "China Takes a Back Seat in International Diplomacy Over Ukraine," in which it suggested that "China has repeatedly called for peace talks in Ukraine," while adding that "What it has not done is press Russia to negotiate…". It is somewhat of a relief to see that the Times used the word "negotiate" instead of "sanction." But their tone seems to suggest that China somehow has a greater ability to sway Russia or press the "stop" button on the conflict than either the US and most of its allies combined might have.</p> <p> In the American media's warped narratives on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US is whitewashed as a mediator, a peacekeeper, and a savior who protects the vulnerable from utter despair, while China is blackwashed as the nation that "stands aloof," "waits and sees", and hesitates to "act."</p> <p> But in reality, America's sanctions stick and bellicose rhetoric are only worsening the situation, narrowing the window for a possible clawback from escalation, and steering Ukraine and Russia away from the negotiating table. And its unprovoked smear campaign against China over the Ukraine crisis will do nothing to help bring an end to the conflict, other than divert the public's attention and generate more anti-China hate.</p> <p> Sanctions provide no path to solutions. Weapons are not the answer to peace. Disinformation is no means of persuasion. To turn around the deteriorating situation and prevent further needless suffering, the US should use its leverage and work with other nations to bring Ukraine and Russia, among other stakeholders, back to the negotiating table, instead of incessantly throwing dirt on another country.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The Global Development Initiative (GDI) has received prompt response and support from the U.N. and nearly 100 countries since being proposed by China last September.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0325/FOREIGN202203250914000591572598823.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 450px;" /></p> <p> <em>The China-aided Cambodia-China Friendship Preah Kossamak Hospital starts operation on March 21, 2021. (Photo courtesy of the China International Development Cooperation Agency )</em></p> <p> As COVID-19 severely impacts the process of global development, China is leading the international society to focus on and promote development, as well as calling on the world to jointly build a global community of development with a shared future. It exemplifies the wisdom and sense of responsibility of a major country at this critical historical juncture.</p> <p> As a Chinese saying goes, “A man of wisdom adapts to changes; a man of knowledge acts by circumstances.” The GDI's wide and prompt response stems from the fact that it addresses the common concerns of the international society and the people around the world.</p> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread in the world, and the Human Development Index experienced the first drop in 30 years. As a result of the pandemic, about 100 million additional people are living in poverty and over 800 million suffering hunger.</p> <p> The world development is getting even more unequal and unbalanced, necessitating urgent action by international society to narrowing the development gap.</p> <p> As another major initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping after the Belt and Road Initiative, the GDI "remobilizes" the world for global development cooperation and "reconfirms" the people-centered approach to human rights. It has mapped out a strategy for narrowing the North-South gap and addressing development imbalance, and has thereby given a boost to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p> <p> The GDI has become tremendously attractive because of China's successful practice. Since the country initiated reform and opening up in 1978, it has always taken economic development as a major task and achieved remarkable progress.</p> <p> The country adheres to a people-centered development philosophy, and is constantly enhancing Chinese people's sense of happiness, fulfillment and security. Pursuing high-quality economic development, it also follows a new development concept featuring innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared growth. The country has eliminated poverty and built a moderately prosperous society in all respects as scheduled, which has further made it a successful example for the rest of the world.</p> <p> Prioritizing development and centering on the people, the GDI is committed to inclusive and innovation-driven growth, harmonious man-nature coexistence, and results-oriented actions. It carries distinctive Chinese characteristics.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0325/FOREIGN202203250914000237715905170.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 675px;" /></p> <p> <em>A member of a Chinese agricultural expert team aiding Africa instructs a local technician on agricultural production. (Photo courtesy of the Chinese Embassy in Senegal)</em></p> <p> Siddharth Chatterjee, U.N. Resident Coordinator in China, said the initiative explains to the world China's successful experience in building a moderately prosperous society. He believes China will make global development much more inclusive and balanced.</p> <p> China's broad-minded perspective has made the GDI widely appealing. China always believes that true development is development for all, and all countries should join, contribute to and benefit from global development. It's not right that only one country enjoys development while the rest can't, or a group of countries make progress while other groups don't.</p> <p> Since the GDI was proposed, it has been a public product that's open to the world. It aims at accelerating the implementation of the U.N.'s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, advancing the common development of the world and making global development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive.</p> <p> On multiple bilateral and multilateral occasions, President Xi has expressed the hope that all relevant parties can join the GDI, and he has received active responses. At the Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit, he said this initiative is highly compatible with the G20’s goal and priority of promoting global development. He also said that the initiative has much to contribute to ASEAN countries’ efforts to meet their development needs and can be mutually reinforcing with ASEAN Community Vision 2025, while delivering a speech at a special summit to commemorate the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations.</p> <p> China's practical actions are making the GDI well implemented. What makes an initiative vital is its implementation. Since proposing the GDI, China has been adhering to "results-oriented" actions. It encourages the world to prioritize cooperation in areas such as poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, among other areas.</p> <p> The Group of Friends of the GDI was launched in January this year and will focus its work on strengthening policy dialogue, sharing best practices and promoting practical cooperation. It is expected to inject important impetus into the implementation of the GDI.</p> <p> At bilateral and multilateral levels, China is proactively aligning the GDI with development strategies of relevant countries and regions. So far, the initiative has been docked with the Pacific Roadmap for sustainable development and the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent by Pacific island countries. African countries also synergized the GDI with the African Union's Agenda 2063.</p> <p> Development bears on the hopes and the very survival of the peoples of all countries. It embodies the expression of their dignity and their rights. Facing challenges, the mankind must hold tight the key of development.</p> <p> China is willing to work with all parties and actively implement the GDI to ensure that no country or individual is left behind and no aspiration is overlooked. It will make new contributions to building a world of common prosperity and building a global community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo/Li Lai)</em></p> <p> Lately, Chinese President Xi Jinping held virtual video summits and had video and phone calls with multiple foreign leaders to seek cooperation, promote development and safeguard peace in pursuit of common interests of the international community, showing China’s sense of responsibility as a major country in building a community with a shared future for mankind.</p> <p> “We need to shoulder our responsibility to bring more stability and certainty to a turbulent and fluid world,” said Xi in a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on March 8.</p> <p> When speaking with Indonesian President Joko Widodo over the phone on March 16, Xi called on the two sides to keep the global market stable and supply chains unimpeded and promote the concrete implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI).</p> <p> “China stands ready to work with all parties to uphold true multilateralism, stand for international fairness and justice, and safeguard the legitimate rights and common interests of emerging market economies and developing countries,” he stressed in a phone conversation with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on March 18.</p> <p> The year 2022 brings with it plenty of challenges. While the COVID-19 pandemic has yet to be conquered, the Ukraine crisis arose, further complicating the international situation that was already filled with uncertainties. Such a critical moment requires countries to pluck up their courage and shoulder their responsibilities.</p> <p> As a responsible major country, China has always moved on the right course of the historical trend, held high the banner of multilateralism and enhanced cooperation and solidarity with all peace-loving countries that pursue development to jointly address challenges and create a bright future for the entire world.</p> <p> China is an important force for maintaining world peace. Some major countries, trying to hold on to their hegemony, have resurrected Cold War mentality and stoked bloc confrontation, which has fueled instability and division in the world. China, however, believes that competition between major countries should not be the order of the day and zero-sum game is not the right choice.</p> <p> It calls on countries to follow the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, reject the notion of exclusive or absolute security, and stay committed to ceasing conflicts through negotiation, resolving disputes through dialogue, and increasing mutual trust through cooperation to jointly build a world of enduring peace.</p> <p> After the Ukraine crisis emerged, China has endeavored to facilitate dialogue for peace and stressed that all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported, which shows a stark contrast with certain countries that try to add fuel to the fire and fully reflects China’s philosophy of peaceful development.</p> <p> China has made active efforts to facilitate common development. The country believes that good development is sustainable and true development is development for all.</p> <p> While focusing on running its own affairs well and promoting high-quality economic development, it has actively developed global partnerships, continuously expanding the convergence of interests with other countries and tightening the ties for common development.</p> <p> China has pushed ahead with the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road, with the number of countries and international organizations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) reaching 180.</p> <p> The country has also proposed the GDI and endeavored to promote the building of an international consensus on global sustainable development.</p> <p> At present, some countries are using the Ukraine crisis as a pretext to implement sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions, dragging down the world economy that is already struggling under the pandemic, which harm various parties including themselves and inflict suffering on the people.</p> <p> For global stability and the work and life of billions of people, China has been doing its best for world peace and creating favorable conditions for global development.</p> <p> China supports Indonesia in playing its role as the president of the Group of 20 (G20), and its effort to host a successful 2022 G20 Bali Summit focusing on the theme of “Recover Together, Recover Stronger”, which reflects China’s determination to forge synergy for common development.</p> <p> China is the mainstay of strengthening global governance. It believes that when faced with challenges of a global nature, no country can stay aloof or unaffected. The country has stressed that all countries must pull together in these trying times, enhance communication and coordination on COVID-19, climate change and other global issues, build maximum consensus, and pursue convergence of interests wherever possible.</p> <p> China remains steadfast in championing and practicing true multilateralism, advocates the universal values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, and opposes hegemonism, power politics and bloc politics. It calls on all countries to safeguard the UN-centered international system and uphold the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter as they work together to make the global governance system fairer and more equitable.</p> <p> As the chair of BRICS this year, China is ready to work with various parties to maintain the development momentum of the BRICS cooperation mechanism and build a high-quality partnership that is more comprehensive, closer, more pragmatic and more inclusive, which is expected to further increase the voice of emerging markets and developing countries in global governance.</p> <p> Facts have proved that in a world of instability and transformation, China always serves as an anchor for stability and a force for good, and always stands on the right side of history.</p> <p> No matter how the international landscape evolves, China will continue to keep a global perspective, honor its responsibilities, and hold high the banner of peace, development and win-win cooperation to promote the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.

(Photo/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has garnered widespread attention across the globe. The wall-to-wall coverage and outpouring of reactions to the Russia-Ukraine conflict from the West has raised eyebrows at its double standard toward other humanitarian crises, which has unsheathed flagrant racist and biased attitudes toward the value of non-white lives that also matter.</p> <p> CBS News senior correspondent in Kyiv Charlie D'Agata, for instance, has faced a widespread backlash due to his discriminatory comments on the Ukraine crisis: "This isn't a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European – I have to choose those words carefully, too – city where you wouldn't expect that, or hope that it's going to happen," he said.</p> <p> The seasoned correspondent was forced to apologize later, saying he spoke "in a way I regret." However, his remarks are not part of an isolated incident. Ukraine's former deputy general prosecutor David Sakvarelidze spoke to the BBC, suggesting that it is harder for him to watch white people fleeing the conflict.</p> <p> "It's very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed," Sakvarelidze said. The BBC presenter responded: "I understand and of course respect the emotion."</p> <p> Likewise, a visibly emotional ITV News correspondent Lucy Watson proclaimed: "Now the unthinkable has happened to them, and this is not a developing, Third World nation; this is Europe," as if victims from the world's other humanitarian crises had naturally been inclined to expect to wake up to a devastating war.</p> <p> One French commentator on BFM TV, France's most-watched cable news channel, also came under fire, implying that it's much more conceivable to have attacks in other regions of the world. "We are in a European city and we have cruise missile fire as though we were in Iraq or Afghanistan, can you imagine," he said.</p> <p> Coverage on the Russia-Ukraine conflict has veered into a troubling tone on race and the international status of migrants. Journalists report on the conflict in shock as if bloodshed was the exclusive purview of non-white communities. Such attitudes are strewn across the West and have underlined the Western side's ingrained double standard – namely, valuing white lives over those dying in conflicts outside Europe.</p> <p> Ukraine's refugee crisis has revealed the West's double standards even more clearly. Whopping numbers of people have fled Ukraine, and they are being welcomed as refugees should be by countries across Europe that previously closed their doors to others.</p> <p> The Russia-Ukraine conflict has witnessed Western countries' tremendous "solidarity" – providing a steady flow of "support" – in response to the humanitarian crisis. However, Ukraine is not the only country suffering from a humanitarian crisis. Why do these Western countries treat humanitarian crises outside Europe with indifference and unspeakable brutality?</p> <p> "[Afghan people] must be wondering what makes their humanitarian crisis so unimportant. Is it the color of their skin? Is it that they are not white? They're not European? That their problems come from a U.S. gun or a U.S. invasion," Irish Member of the European Parliament, Clare Daly questioned, denouncing Western countries for treating other humanitarian crises much more lightly compared to the Ukraine crisis.</p> <p> Trivializing wars in the Middle East and dehumanizing entire populations is not new in the West. The past decades have witnessed Western countries' brazen attitude toward wars in the Middle East that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of people. Missiles from the U.S. landed in the Middle East frequently, but voices from Western media disappeared and reactions were subdued quickly. Casualties in the Middle East seem to be more tolerable to Western media and politicians than those in the present Ukraine crisis, as years of dehumanization have turned the Middle Eastern people into nothing but a statistic confined to the unread columns of newspapers.</p> <p> CNN political correspondent Julia Ioffe made a horrific comparison between Syria and Ukraine in a clip circulating on social media, which displays the most egregious ramifications of the West's dehumanization of the Middle East. "It's one thing for sarin gas to be used on people far away Syria who are Muslim and who are of a different culture but what is Europe going to do when it's used on European soil on Europeans," she said, suggesting people from the Middle East are inferior to Europeans and that it is somehow acceptable for them to be killed.</p> <p> The vastly different treatment received by Ukrainians and those of Middle Eastern nationalities on the part of Western countries, in addition to the casual racism displayed in Western coverage of the Ukraine crisis, has laid bare Western biases, prejudices and double standards, which should be of no surprise. In fact, no life is worth more than another. So until Western countries do away with its racist double standard and treat humanitarian crises with equal weight, it simply has "no credibility," just as Daly opined with great gusto in front of the cameras of Western media.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> <em>The U.S. should clarify thoroughly its military biological activities around the world with a responsible attitude and stop standing alone in opposing the establishment of a Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) verification regime, so as to help improve global biosecurity.</em></p> <p> Russia recently exposed military biological cooperation projects conducted by the U.S. in Ukraine, further unmasking the U.S., an empire of military biological activities.</p> <p> Among all countries in the world, the U.S. has carried out the most military biological activities. The country has inherited the evil legacy of the notorious Unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese Army that waged the war of aggression against China, and developed biological weapons with Fort Detrick as the major base.</p> <p> Its research and development of biological weapons at the base has continued even after it joined the BWC in 1975. The international community has therefore referred to Fort Detrick as “the center of the U.S. government’s darkest experiments”.</p> <p> In the past few decades, the U.S. has continuously expanded its scope of military biological activities. According to data released by the country, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) carries out biological cooperation projects in more than 30 countries around the world.</p> <p> The country controls several hundred biological laboratories using pretexts including cooperation for reducing biosecurity risks and strengthening global public health. Its military biological activities in Ukraine are only the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p> Despite the international consensus on ensuring compliance with the BWC through multilateral verification, the U.S. has regarded its global military biological activities as its domestic affairs and allowed no external inspection and verification. Therefore, its military biological activities have been running wild.</p> <p> In 2001, when the international community already reached an agreement on the establishment of a BWC verification mechanism, the U.S. suddenly withdrew from negotiations over the establishment of the mechanism on the pretext that such verification would harm its security and economic interests, and has since been standing alone against the establishment of the mechanism.</p> <p> It’s exactly because of the lack of verification mechanism that the country’s military biological activities have increasingly aroused grave concerns in the international community.</p> <p> However, the U.S. has taken a more radical stance on compliance with the BWC when questioned by the international community. The country stubbornly insists that only itself can decide whether it has abided by the convention.</p> <p> Not only doesn’t it allow the international community to carry out verification, but it rejects questions from any foreign country about its military biological activities and accuses those who raise such questions of spreading disinformation. This is typical bandit logic and hegemonic behavior.</p> <p> The U.S. often contradicts itself. The self-contradictory information released by the U.S. probably couldn’t even convince itself. Last November, the U.S. said it had cooperation facilities including 26 biolabs in Ukraine. On March 11, the country changed the figure to 46.</p> <p> The U.S. claimed that it hasn’t controlled labs in Ukraine, but only sent personnel to the country to help ensure lab safety occasionally. However, according to an agreement between the DoD and the Ukrainian side signed in 2005, representatives of the DoD have the right to participate in all related activities at U.S.-Ukraine cooperation facilities, including labs in Ukraine. The agreement also stipulates that all dangerous viruses in Ukraine must be stored in these labs and provided for the U.S. side as required, and information marked or designated by the U.S. side as “sensitive” should be withheld from public disclosure by Ukraine.</p> <p> The international community can’t help but wonder: Who on earth do these labs belong to? How many of these labs are there? What does the U.S. needs so many viruses for? Why can’t public health information be made public? Given that the U.S. runs biolabs all over Central Asia, East Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Middle East, and Africa, do all these biolabs operate under the so-called “cooperation” model as that in Ukraine?</p> <p> The international community has no reason not to support the U.S. if it really intends to safeguard biosecurity and strengthen public health. Nevertheless, if the U.S. is using its biological research facilities overseas to grab biological resources and even develop biological weapons, it’s quite another matter.</p> <p> For the sake of the health and safety of people in Ukraine and its surrounding regions as well as the entire world, it’s time the U.S. gave the international community an explanation for its military biological activities.</p> <p> It’s hoped that the U.S. will clarify thoroughly its military biological activities around the world with a responsible attitude and stop standing alone in opposing the establishment of the BWC verification regime, so as to help improve global biosecurity.</p> <p> Compliance with a convention doesn’t equal shouting slogans. All countries must uphold the authority of international law.</p> <p> The international community has every reason to assess the documents disclosed by Russia under the framework of the United Nations and the BWC, and at the same time listen to the explanation of the U.S. side in a fair and just way. This will help restore the international community’s confidence in America’s fulfillment of its international obligations and improve global biosecurity, which conforms to the common interests of the international community.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> <strong>--By their very own standard, American media outlets are the culprits caught red-handed, manufacturing lies, conspiracies, disinformation, and even worse, propaganda. </strong></p> <p> <strong>--The US is more of a spreader of such false information than a victim of it.</strong></p> <p> What has fascinated me the most in American media's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic is their unremitting obsession with the "lab leak" conspiracy.</p> <p> Through their lens of suspicion and even superstition, the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was no longer a matter of serious science but a fanciful plot, blending with frivolous hearsays, preposterous suppositions, and flagrant prejudices. Despite the fact that numerous scientific studies have proven otherwise, some US media outlets, together with their staunch audiences, are still dwelling upon the lab theories, so much so that they have even begun to cast doubt on America's own bio labs.</p> <p> On March 9, Fox News host Tucker Carlson brought up the issues surrounding US bio labs on his show, in which he called for clarification on the "dangerous biological weapons in Ukraine." Following US Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland's testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in which she admitted the existence of American 'biological facilities' in Ukraine, Tucker Carlson doubled down on his televised queries again on March 14.</p> <p> "Why would we (the US) fund something like that in Ukraine…?" the celebrity TV host asked, "If the 'research materials' in these labs were to escape somehow and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world?"</p> <p> Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, both former American presidential candidates, among other US politicians and military experts, have also seconded Carlson to demand answers to the allegations that the US might have "funded" bio labs and even "bioweapons facility" in Ukraine.</p> <p> Their questioning over whether the US is funding bio labs in Ukraine has invited harsh criticism. NBC News slammed the notion as a conspiracy theory while accusing Tucker Carlson and other figures on the American far right of promoting disinformation and propaganda. Meanwhile, Senator Mitt Romney <em>arraigned </em>Tulsi Gabbard, who had tweeted that "There are 25 plus US-funded biolabs in Ukraine which if breached would release and spread deadly pathogens to US/world," for spreading "treasonous lies."</p> <p> The irony here couldn't be more conspicuous. Remember that for the past two years (and counting), American media outlets have kept concocting one "lab leak" conspiracy theory after another with absolutely zero substantiated evidence. By their very own standard, they are the culprits caught red-handed, manufacturing lies, conspiracies, disinformation, and even worse, propaganda. The US is more of a spreader of such false information than a victim of it.</p> <p> <em>[Related Reading: <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/0903/c90000-9892068.html" target="_blank"><u>Tracing the origins of US media's disinformation campaign against China on COVID-19</u></a>]</em></p> <p> But America's bio lab affairs are fundamentally different from the "lab leak" conspiracies with which it has intended to frame up China in vain. The US is <em>the </em>nation that has invested millions of dollars in overseas bio labs, and it is the only nation to have blocked new means for verifying compliance with the <em>1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)</em> terms. Its opacity and equivocation pertaining to its global bio lab operations (never mind whether it is developing bioweapons elsewhere or not) require explanation and even call for a joint probe.</p> <p> While the US has kept rinsing and reusing the same old conspiracy theories, it should have predicted that such inertia in its thinking would enable some US media, to engage in a self-examination of their own nation's record, which can be a benign thing for the sake of global biological safety. Call it a conspiracy spillover. Or call it an "autoimmune" backlash. At last, they have hit the mark by a mere fluke.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The annual “two sessions” of China’s national legislature and top political advisory body offer the world an important opportunity to gain a better understanding of the essence and practice of Chinese democracy.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0316/FOREIGN202203160906000521404217801.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>The closing meeting of the fifth session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, March 10, 2022. (People’s Daily/Lei Sheng)</em></p> <p> During this year’s “two sessions”, namely the fifth session of the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) and the fifth session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), NPC deputies and CPPCC members actively performed their duties and turned people’s voices and ideas into general consensus on state governance.</p> <p> The annual meetings have showed the international community how China’s democracy is an extensive and true democracy that works and China’s sound governance has strong democratic foundations.</p> <p> Democracy starts with the full expression of the people’s wishes. The Chinese government has solicited public opinions and suggestions via multiple channels for drafting the 2022 Government Work Report, and received thousands of opinions and suggestions from all walks of life. More than 1,100 pieces of representative suggestions from netizens were selected, and some key advice has been taken by the report.</p> <p> Chinese netizens actively participated in the suggestion solicitation campaign called “share your ideas at the ‘two Sessions’”, which enabled different kinds of suggestions from the people to be directly fed to NPC deputies and CPPCC members before and during this year’s “two sessions”.</p> <p> Through the “two sessions”, the world sees clearly that the Chinese people are showing greater interest in democratic participation, which is expanding in scope and depth and diversifying its forms and channels.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0316/FOREIGN202203160907000064852828317.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Deputies to the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) walk out of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after the closing meeting of the fifth session of the 13th NPC, March 11, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Guo Junfeng)</em></p> <p> Democracy can only be truly implemented through the fulfillment of the people’s wishes. Last year, offices and departments under the State Council handled 8,666 pieces of suggestions submitted by NPC deputies and 5,718 proposals submitted by CPPCC members during the 2021 “two sessions”, which accounted for 96.4 percent and 93.4 percent of the total numbers of motions and proposals, respectively, announced the State Council Information Office (SCIO) right before this year’s “two sessions”.</p> <p> All the suggestions and proposals submitted by national lawmakers and political advisors during the “two sessions” last year have been handled on schedule, according to the SCIO.</p> <p> After careful consideration of the suggestions from NPC deputies and CPPCC members, relevant departments adopted more than 4,300 pieces of advice and subsequently introduced over 1,600 policies and measures.</p> <p> The detailed data has fully proven that China has ensured that its people have channels to express their aspirations, wishes and demands on issues ranging from important national strategies and policies to social governance and basic necessities of life, enabling their voices to be heard and their requests to be answered.</p> <p> Discussions on the effectiveness of democracy have been mounting in the international community.</p> <p> People are well aware that in some countries, practice of democracy has increasingly become empty promise—the people are only called upon to vote and then are forgotten once they have cast their votes; the people only hear high-sounding promises during an election campaign but have no say whatsoever afterwards; and they are wooed when their votes are wanted but are ignored once the election is over.</p> <p> China always holds the belief that democracy is not a decorative ornament, but an instrument for addressing the issues that concern the people. A democracy that only provides people with channels to express their wishes but not ways to fulfill them is not a true democracy.</p> <p> In China, the people’s status as masters of the country is the essence of people’s democracy. The country’s whole-process people’s democracy ensures that the people’s voices are heard and their wishes are represented in every aspect of China’s political and social life.</p> <p> China’s democracy is a true democracy that works. It ensures that the people’s demands can be freely expressed and effectively fulfilled and that the Chinese people are both the builders and beneficiaries of democracy.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0316/FOREIGN202203160907000447269610549.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>An official with the Communist Party of China (CPC) committee of Yinxi community, Nanqiao district, Chuzhou city, east China’s Anhui province, asks local residents for advice on community governance, Jan. 3, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Dong Chao)</em></p> <p> In recent years, China has achieved major strategic achievements in the fight against COVID-19, historically eliminated absolute poverty, and built a moderately prosperous society in all respects and resolved a series of major risks. The country has embarked on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist country and is marching toward the goal of common prosperity.</p> <p> These achievements couldn’t have been made without the efforts of the Chinese people empowered by the Chinese democracy.</p> <p> China’s tremendous achievements in development have proved that its whole-process people’s democracy is reasonable and effective, and has promoted the development and progress of the country and stimulated the creativity of the people, pointed out famous Egyptian jurist Shuki Said.</p> <p> High-quality democracy in China has improved the system, capacity and efficiency of national governance.</p> <p> China’s whole-process people’s democracy, created and developed in line with the country’s national conditions, contributes a new model to the international political spectrum.

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> Recently, some politicians and media outlets in the U.S. have repeatedly concocted and spread disinformation in order to smear and defame China over the Ukraine issue. The practice of fabricating rumors to shift the blame has been proven despicable and futile by facts. Such acts can’t cover up America’s responsibility for the Ukraine crisis. Instead, they have further exposed the country’s dangerous intention of stirring up trouble and plunging the world into chaos.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0316/FOREIGN202203160903000427288487453.png" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Charity staff members deliver free food on the plaza of the Lviv railway station in Lviv, Ukraine, March 9, 2022. (Xinhua/Ren Ke)</em></p> <p> The evolution of the Ukraine issue is something China does not want to see. As a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, China always adopts an objective, fair, and responsible attitude toward global events, makes judgments and takes its stand independently based on the merits of the matter itself.</p> <p> There is a complex historical background and context behind the Ukraine issue, which needs to be solved with a cool head and a rational mind.</p> <p> China believes that to resolve the current crisis, countries must uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and respect and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, adhere to the principle of indivisible security and accommodate the legitimate security concerns of the parties involved, settle disputes by peaceful means through dialogue and negotiation, and keep in mind the long-term peace and stability of the region and put in place a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.</p> <p> China’s stance on the Ukraine issue is open and straightforward, and its suggestions for resolving the Ukraine crisis positive and constructive.</p> <p> At the moment, the top priority in resolving the Ukraine crisis is to promote peace talks, rather than adding fuel to the flames of tensions between Ukraine and Russia.</p> <p> China stands, as always, on the side of peace, cooperation, fairness, and justice, supports any endeavor that helps ease the tense situation and bring a political solution to the crisis, and opposes any action that goes against diplomatic settlement of the issue and escalates the tensions.</p> <p> China has maintained close communication with relevant parties and made efforts to facilitate peace talks. It is ready to continue playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks between Russia and Ukraine and work alongside with the international community to carry out necessary mediation when needed.</p> <p> China has responded to the Ukraine issue in a responsible way. What it has done to help resolve the crisis has truly demonstrated the sense of responsibility a major country is supposed to have.</p> <p> In contrast, certain country attempts to create a crisis, benefit from the crisis, and shift its burden of crises onto others, which will only harm both itself and others.</p> <p> China does not agree to the idea of resolving the Ukraine issue with sanctions and opposes unilateral sanctions that lack the basis of international law.</p> <p> Sanctions have never been an effective approach to solving problems, but only cause serious difficulty for the economy and people’s livelihood in countries concerned and worsen division and confrontation.</p> <p> History has long proven that sanctions not only result in an economic situation where multiple players lose, but disrupt the process of political settlement.</p> <p> According to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department, the number of sanctions imposed by the U.S. has climbed 10 times during the past two decades, and the last U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed 3,800 sanctions during his presidency, which means the administration wielded the big stick of sanctions about three times a day.</p> <p> The unilateral sanctions imposed by the U.S. have inflicted a lot of trouble on the world and caused persistent and systemic human rights violations. The country should stop abusing sanctions and abandon the futile attempt to coerce other countries into doing things they oppose.</p> <p> The fact that some politicians and media outlets in the U.S. cooked up and disseminated disinformation over the Ukraine issue has reminded people of America’s disgraceful record of using lies and rumors as pretexts to frequently wage wars.</p> <p> Throughout its less than 250 years of history, there were only less than 20 years when the U.S. didn’t launch military operations against foreign countries. And among the diverse pretexts for its military interventions abroad, some are even false information fabricated by the U.S. itself.</p> <p> The U.S. once used a small tube of white powder as evidence of the so-called weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and launched military strikes against the latter, bringing terrible disasters to the Iraqi people.</p> <p> It also used a video deliberately staged by the White Helmets, an organization funded by Western intelligence agencies, as evidence to conduct air strikes in Syria.</p> <p> Such lessons are not long gone. The U.S. should reflect on its wrongful actions rather than repeat the same mistakes.</p> <p> George Frost Kennan, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, warned the U.S. government in the 1990s that expanding NATO up to Russia’s borders would be “the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era”.</p> <p> As the instigator of the Ukraine crisis, the U.S. should reflect on its role in the crisis and stop deceiving and confusing the public. It’s about time the country shouldered its due responsibility, took practical actions to help alleviate tensions and solve problems and contributed to world peace.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

Photo: Xinhua</em></p> <p> Hindu extremists are increasingly taking their "militant message" into the mainstream while fermenting "communal hate" in a push to convert India into a Hindu state, wrote the New York Times earlier last month in an in-depth article headlined <em>As Officials Look Away, Hate Speech in India Nears Dangerous Levels</em>.</p> <p> The article pinpointed the rampant hate speech adopted by Hindu extremists against the Muslim community, including promoting a genocidal campaign to slaughter "2 million Muslims" and even pushing rhetoric in support of ethnic cleansing targeting Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Such hate speech "is stoking communal tensions in a country where small triggers have incited mass-death tragedies," the article wrote.</p> <p> The prevalence of Islamophobic sentiments and rising incidences of violent attacks targeting Muslims have not garnered enough attention from the Indian government at both the central and local levels. On the contrary, Hindu extremists' heinous agenda is being "enabled" and even "normalized" by political leaders and law enforcement officials in the world's second-most populous nation, the article highlighted.</p> <p> In consequence, Muslims and even other religious minorities in the country have had to contend with the mounting perils of hate speech and violent attacks.</p> <p> Emboldened by the re-election of Yogi Adityanath (a monk who in the past formed a youth group accused of inciting violence), who serves as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, Hindu mobs in 2020 staged a series of riots in New Delhi that resulted in the grisly deaths of 53 people (many of whom were burned to death), and over two-thirds of which were Muslims.</p> <p> In 2021, several video clips of violent attacks by Hindus went viral in India on social media: one showed a 45-year-old rickshaw driver being paraded through the streets of Kanpur, a city in Uttar Pradesh, as his teary daughter begged the mob to stop beating him, as reported by the BBC. In January this year, an Indian pastor and his wife were assaulted and wounded by a mob of Hindu extremists, and when they attempted to file a police report they were rejected by the local police.</p> <p> India's political figures have not only turned a blind eye to Hindu extremists, but they instead have fostered a symbiotic relationship with them, since the group remains the staunchest supporter of India's right-wing politicians. On March 1, Bloomberg published an analysis entitled <em>Anti-Muslim Hatred Is Shaping India's Elections</em>, which pointed out that Indian political leaders have been exploiting "existing divisions in society" and "deep-rooted religious hatred" to cement their positions. "While India is sensitive to international criticism of its treatment of Muslims, it does little to address the problem," the analysis noted.</p> <p> In January, Gregory Stanton, director of Genocide Watch, who previously predicted the massacre of the Tutsi in Rwanda before events broke out in 1994, said at a briefing that there were early "signs and processes" of genocide in India, according to Al Jazeera. Stanton was convinced that the Hindu extremists and their genocidal agenda must be stopped. "Because once the mobs take over it could turn deadly," he said.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> China has set its economic growth target for 2022 at around 5.5 percent, according to a government work report delivered at the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC) on March 5.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0309/FOREIGN202203090924000538323388390.jpg" style="width: 854px; height: 569px;" /></p> <p> <em>A worker produces optical cables in a factory in Suixi Economic Development Zone, Huaibei, east China's Anhui province, March 5, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Li Xin)</em></p> <p> The international society generally believes that this target is science-based and reasonable, and mirrors China's initiative. It will help guide public expectations, boost confidence, and build consensus for development, and promote China's high-quality development.</p> <p> China will keep contributing to global recovery and growth while working to realize the growth target.</p> <p> Both economic growth rate and increment are important when one evaluates China's contribution to the world economy.</p> <p> In 2021, China's GDP hit 114.4 trillion yuan, or $17.7 trillion at the yearly average exchange rate. It is estimated to account for over 18 percent of the global economy. The domestic value added of the country reached $3 trillion, which is unprecedented in the history of global economic development.</p> <p> To increase China’s 2021 GDP of 114.4 trillion yuan by 5.5 percent is equivalent to realizing a 7.4-percent growth five years ago, or a 10.5-percent growth 10 years ago. The 5.5 -percent growth will contribute a considerable amount to the world economic growth.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0309/FOREIGN202203090924000143007803492.jpg" style="width: 864px; height: 576px;" /></p> <p> <em>A woman works at a workshop of a special textile company in Daying Economic Development Zone in southwest China's Sichuan province, March 4, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Liu Changsong)</em></p> <p> To evaluate China's contribution to the world economy, one must value both the quantity and quality of the Chinese economy.</p> <p> At present, global recovery is facing multiple barriers and the process of global development has been severely impacted. To deliver more sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security to the people through development is a common task for all countries.</p> <p> China is fully, accurately and comprehensively implementing a new development philosophy featuring innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared growth and takes high-quality development as a theme of economic and social development for the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) and beyond.</p> <p> The country has actively endeavored to transform its growth model, optimized economic structure and shifted growth drivers, creating opportunities for and injecting energy into global development.</p> <p> An international expert remarked that the adherence of China, a country with 1.4 billion people, to the path of high-quality development is an important contribution made by the country to the world economic development and reflects its major country responsibility.</p> <p> To evaluate China's contribution to the world economy, one must see the country's development and its interaction with the world.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0309/FOREIGN202203090923000371211652237.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 506px;" /></p> <p> <em>Citizens visit a tourist attraction in Suining, southwest China's Sichuan province as flowers bloom, March 6, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Liu Changsong)</em></p> <p> China is opening up more sectors of the economy in a more thorough fashion to create a world-class business environment established on market principles and the rule of law. From reaching $6 trillion in foreign trade for the first time, to making new records in foreign direct investment inflow, and to signing over 200 cooperation documents on the Belt and Road Initiative with more than 140 countries and 32 international organizations, China is actively integrating itself into the global economy and continuously promoting win-win results through its own development.</p> <p> Meanwhile, China is a staunch supporter for the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core. It is actively negotiating on and signing more high-standard free trade pacts and regional trade agreements, and building a global governance system that's fairer, more just and more reasonable, playing a significant role in promoting strong, balanced, sustainable and inclusive growth of the world economy.</p> <p> Obviously, China is facing more risks and challenges in its development, such as the ongoing pandemic, sluggish world recovery, fluctuation in commodity prices, and increasingly more complicated domestic and external environment. However, the country's economic fundamentals sustaining long-term growth remain unchanged.</p> <p> The country is surely able to withstand downward pressure and maintain stable economic operation, and will inject more positive energy into the world economy to make it stable, healthy and sustainable.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The high-level segment of the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council kicked off on Feb. 28. When the world is still facing the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, deteriorating poverty and inequality, as well as challenges against the global human rights cause, all countries must make joint efforts to better promote and protect human rights,</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0303/FOREIGN202203030858000151384439058.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Two girls play in an agricultural park in Chengjiang township, southwest China's Chongqing municipality, Feb. 12, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Qin Tingfu)</em></p> <p> China will continue to steadfastly pursue a human rights development path that meets the trend of times and suits its national conditions. While achieving historic progress in the cause of human rights at home, the country has taken an active part in global human rights governance, making Chinese contributions and providing Chinese schemes.</p> <p> Respecting and protecting human rights is an unremitting pursuit of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The 100-year history of the CPC is a history of the Party uniting and leading the Chinese people to strive for, respect, safeguard and develop human rights. China's tremendous transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong is a process when the country has continuously ensured the Chinese people's right to life, right to development and other basic human rights.</p> <p> Having built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, China has brought about a historic resolution to the problem of extreme poverty, providing a solid material foundation for protecting and developing human rights.</p> <p> When responding to COVID-19, China has put people’s interests first, with a belief that nothing is more precious than people’s lives. It has protected the lives and health of the Chinese people to the maximum extent possible.</p> <p> China is the only major country in the world that has formulated and implemented action plans on human rights for four consecutive terms. There is increasing awareness in the international community that China is acting as true champions of human rights.</p> <p> Human rights are historical, concrete and realistic, and cannot be detached from the context of countries' different social and political conditions, history and cultural traditions.</p> <p> China has made historic achievements in human rights, because it adheres to the leadership of the CPC and the principal status of the people, proceeds from reality, takes the rights to subsistence and development as its primary and basic human rights, protects human rights according to law, and actively participates in global human rights governance. These are major characteristics of China's human rights development, and also valuable experiences gained by the country.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0303/FOREIGN202203030858000322274757856.jpg" style="width: 863px; height: 589px;" /></p> <p> <em>Senior citizens dance at a nursing home in Yichun, east China's Jiangxi province, Feb. 24, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Zhou Liang)</em></p> <p> Since June 2017, the resolution proposed by China entitled “The Contribution of Development to the Enjoyment of All Human Rights” has been adopted by the UN Human Rights Council for three times, which fully indicates the wide international recognition received by China for its experiences in human rights development.</p> <p> Without development, there would be no human rights to speak of, nor could the rights enjoyed by the people be sustainable. The right to development is an inalienable human right, which is affirmed by the UN Declaration on the Right to Development.</p> <p> On promoting global human rights governance, China acts as an positive contributor to common development. It believes that long-term world development cannot be sustained if some countries get wealthier at the expense of others that are kept poor and backward. Only common development of countries makes a more prosperous world.</p> <p> China has proposed and implemented the jointly building of the Belt and Road to enhance international development cooperation and share development results with other countries. It also actively pursues South-South Cooperation, offering assistance for other developing countries within its capability with no political strings attached and helping other developing countries, especially the least developed ones, eliminate poverty. Besides, the country has proposed the Global Development Initiative to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is constantly contributing its wisdom and schemes to the development of the international human rights cause.</p> <p> In judging whether human rights are upheld in a country, one cannot use other countries’ standards, still less apply double standards or use human rights as a political tool to interfere in the affairs of other countries. On promoting global human rights governance, China acts as a firm defender of equity and justice. It steadfastly promotes greater democracy and rule of law in international relations, follows true multilateralism, and steers global human rights governance toward greater fairness, equity and inclusiveness.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0303/FOREIGN202203030858000469894187802.jpg" style="width: 863px; height: 582px;" /></p> <p> <em>Tourists take a bamboo raft on a wetland park in Jinhu county, Huai'an, east China's Jiangsu province, Feb. 26, 2022. (People's Daily Online/He Jinghua)</em></p> <p> China is ready to engage in human rights exchanges and cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect, nevertheless, it does not accept self-styled "lecturers" on human rights and rejects stoking bloc confrontation in the name of human rights.</p> <p> Making voices of justice at the UN Human Rights Council together with other developing countries, China firmly opposes the U.S. and the West interfering in other countries' domestic affairs in the name of the so-called "human rights," which is of significant importance for the healthy development of the international human rights cause.</p> <p> The realization of human rights is a common pursuit of mankind, and the promotion and protection of human rights a common cause of all countries. China is willing to work with all relevant parties to promote the shared human values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, promote the healthy development of the international human rights cause, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> This year marks the 50th anniversary of the issuance of the Shanghai Communiqué between China and the U.S.</p> <p> The document was released on Feb. 28, 1972 when then U.S. President Richard Nixon paid a historic visit to China. It ended the prolonged estrangement between China and the U.S. and started the process toward normalization of China-U.S. relations.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0302/FOREIGN202203020906000429571273163.jpg" style="width: 798px; height: 272px;" /></p> <p> <em>Late Chairman Mao Zedong meets with then U.S. President Richard Nixon at Zhongnanhai, the central leadership compound in downtown Beijing, Feb. 21, 1972. (File photo)</em></p> <p> As the first joint communiqué between the two countries, the Shanghai Communiqué affirmed the one-China principle. It was followed by the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the U.S. and the August 17 Joint Communiqué, which were issued in 1978 and 1982, respectively.</p> <p> The one-China principle and the three joint communiqués remain the political foundation for China-U.S. relations. Over the past half century, the relationship between the two countries has made remarkable progress despite ups and downs, and they have both gained huge benefits from their cooperation.</p> <p> However, in recent years, with an aim to contain China, some people in the U.S. have been trying to deny history and hyping the assertion that the U.S. policy of engagement with China has failed. Such practice mirrors Cold War mentality. It negates the history of China-U.S. relations, the achievements made by the two countries in the past 50 years, and the efforts made by the two peoples to promote China-U.S. relations.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0302/FOREIGN202203020906000543255455082.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Late Chairman Mao Zedong meets with then U.S. President Richard Nixon at Zhongnanhai, the central leadership compound in downtown Beijing, Feb. 21, 1972. (File photo)</em></p> <p> The recovery and development of China-U.S. relations was one of the most important event in the development of international relations during the past 50 years, which has benefited the both the two countries and the rest of the world. What's the most important for the development of international relations over the next 50 years to come is that China and the U.S. must find a right way to get along with each other.</p> <p> The commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the issuance of the Shanghai Communiqué offers an occasion for the two countries to draw experience and wisdom from history, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track as soon as possible.</p> <p> To continue upholding the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué, the two countries must advance with history and keep their relations on the right track.</p> <p> Fifty years ago, the "historic handshake across the vastest ocean" astonished the world. However, China-U.S. relations have encountered adversity today. It is because some people in the U.S. are not willing to admit China's rapid development and take China as their major strategic competitor and even an imaginary enemy out of their biased understanding. Such perspective reflects their misjudgment in China's development philosophy, as well as their ignorance for the development of history.</p> <p> To bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track, the U.S. must act with political wisdom and courage, understand China and China's development correctly, and abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum games targeting at China.</p> <p> To continue upholding the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué, the two countries must properly manage their differences according to the principle of seeking common ground while putting aside differences.</p> <p> In the Shanghai Communiqué, China and the U.S. admit that they have essential differences in social system, but it has not affected the development of their relations. The spirit of seeking common ground while putting aside differences reflected in the Shanghai Communiqué is especially of practical significance in today's situation.</p> <p> Some people in the U.S. have intentionally underlined the ideological differences between China and the U.S. to provoke confrontation. Such practice ignored the fact that the common interests shared by the two countries are way bigger than their differences. It is against the aspiration of the two peoples and the common interests of the world.</p> <p> It's not a big deal that China and the U.S. have differences and issues. What's important is that they must manage these differences and issues through sincere communication, so as to prevent strategic misjudgment and avoid confrontation.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0302/FOREIGN202203020907000362809097445.jpg" style="width: 580px; height: 406px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo shows the hall of the Jin Jiang Hotel, where the Shanghai Communiqué was issued. (Photo courtesy of the Jiang International (Holdings) Co., Ltd.)</em></p> <p> To continue upholding the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué, the two countries must deal with the Taiwan question according to the one-China principle.</p> <p> The one-China principle, affirmed in the Shanghai Communiqué, was further confirmed and developed in the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations and the August 17 Joint Communiqué.</p> <p> At present, to contain China with the Taiwan question, the U.S. side has been trying to distort and hollow out the one-China principle, which has brought serious danger to both the stability in the Taiwan Strait and China-U.S. relations.</p> <p> The reunification of China is an unstoppable trend. It will never be changed by any individual, any force or any country. The U.S. must fully recognize that the Taiwan question is highly sensitive, abide by the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués, and stop any practice that challenges the one-China principle or undermines the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. It must also resolutely and firmly oppose "Taiwan Independence," and stop sending wrong signals to “Taiwan independence” forces.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People's Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)&nbsp;</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The human rights situation in the U.S., which has notorious records, worsened in 2021, said the Report on Human Rights Violations in the U.S. in 2021 issued by China's State Council Information Office on Feb. 28.</p> <p> In 2021, the U.S. public persona of “human rights defender” was totally debunked, and the country has become the “biggest destroyer” of human rights in the world, the report said.</p> <p> According to the report, in the U.S., political manipulation led to a sharp surge in COVID-19 deaths; shooting deaths hit a new record; fake democracy trampled on people’s political rights; violent law enforcement made life harder for migrants and refugees; discrimination against ethnic minority groups, especially Asians, intensified. In the meantime, unilateral U.S. actions created new humanitarian crises across the globe.</p> <p> Despite having world’s most advanced medical equipment and technology, the U.S. has the biggest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths globally. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.S., the epidemic prevention and control has been highly politicized, which has become a tool and a bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to attack, reject and confront each other.</p> <p> The U.S. government’s unscientific, unequal and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control conducts have seriously undermined its people’s rights to life and health. People’s mental health deteriorated due to the uncontrolled outbreak. The number of the homeless is staggering. The elderly’ rights to life are flagrantly violated.</p> <p> According to statistics, the average life expectancy of U.S. citizens fell by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War. In particular, the decline in life expectancy among African Americans and Latinos was much more than that among whites. Rather than promoting international cooperation on vaccines, the U.S. has repeatedly coerced the WHO and been keen on shifting the blame and political manipulation.</p> <p> As developing countries are in dire need of vaccines, Washington vigorously pursues “America First” and is engaged in “vaccine nationalism," interfering and dragging down global anti-pandemic cooperation. What the U.S. has done is disregard for the rights to life and health that should be enjoyed by all the people in the world, including Americans.</p> <p> The U.S. has long been habitually touting itself as the "beacon of democracy." However, as a matter of fact, American people's political rights are trampled on by politicians who manipulate fake democracy. Money politics become increasingly rampant in the U.S., which makes politicians more neglectful of people’s interests and demands. Democrats and Republicans are doing everything to restrain and harm electors’ right to vote. The election chaos in the country has further intensified political polarization and continues to tear the society apart.</p> <p> Investigations indicated that the public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since 1958, and international confidence in the U.S. democratic system continues to decline.</p> <p> Though American democracy is rotting, the U.S. is still reluctant to face up to the reality. It is trying to politicize democracy and takes it as a tool to force other countries to pick sides and form cliques to divide the world. Under the disguise of protecting "democracy" and "human rights," the U.S. initiated the so-called Summit for Democracy. However, it only ended up as a farce that drew wide criticism from the international society.</p> <p> The U.S. has always pursued hegemonism, unilateralism and interventionism to maintain its global hegemony. The country frequently uses force, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Its abusive use of unilateral sanctions has caused humanitarian crises.</p> <p> According to the New York Times, investigation found that more than 50,000 U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were reckless and poorly targeted, killing tens of thousands of civilians. A study by an American university indicated that the 20-year U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. A total of 3.5 million Afghans have been displaced.</p> <p> The belligerent U.S. is challenging justice with hegemony, trampling on righteousness with self-interest, and wantonly violating human rights in other countries. It has become the biggest obstacle and destroyer of the sound development of the international human rights cause.</p> <p> The U.S. should face up to and solve its own human rights problems and stop politicizing human rights. It should also join other countries in obeying the principles and rules of the UN Charter and carrying out constructive dialogues and cooperation in the sphere of human rights, so as to jointly promote the healthy development of the international human rights cause.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People's Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)&nbsp;</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> Deputies called on the globe to unite closer for accelerated COVID-19 vaccination around the world at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-level Meeting on COVID-19 Vaccines held on Feb. 25.</p> <p> Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is at a critical moment when unfair distribution of vaccines is severely hindering the global fight against the virus.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0301/FOREIGN202203011351000292656480503.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" /></p> <p> <em>On Jan. 26, 2022, 300,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines donated by China to Mali arrive in Bamako, capital of the African country. (Photo courtesy of the Chinese Embassy in Mali)</em></p> <p> Just as UN General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid said, "Our strength lies in solidarity," mankind must unite together and strive to reach the goal of global vaccination as early as possible, so as to put the pandemic to an end soon.</p> <p> Enhancing unity to fight COVID-19 is the first of the three major issues that deserve much thought and attention at present and over the coming period globally, told by Chinese President Xi Jinping to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres when the two met recently.</p> <p> To achieve fair distribution of vaccines and fill the immunization gap is an urgent task. So far, over 10 billion doses of vaccines have been administered globally. However, only around 17 percent of the people in Africa have received at least one shot, and vaccination rate is lower than 10 percent in 27 countries.</p> <p> As a provider of global public products, China is striving to build a global community of health for all. It has made important contribution to the global fight against the virus and won international acclaim.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0301/FOREIGN202203011351000426066300715.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 399px;" /></p> <p> <em>Hungary received the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by China's Sinopharm on Feb. 16 and started administering them eight days later, becoming the first country in the EU to use Chinese vaccines. (Photo from sinopharm.com)</em></p> <p> China actively advocates and practices solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As a staunch supporter of global solidarity against the virus, China is the first country to make and practice the commitment to taking COVID-19 vaccines as a global public product.</p> <p> Last year, Xi proposed the Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative, aiming to enhance vaccine equity and accessibility in developing countries, so that the immune barrier would be built at an early date.</p> <p> He stressed at the 2022 World Economic Forum Virtual Session that of particular importance is to fully leverage vaccines as a powerful weapon, ensure their equitable distribution, quicken vaccination and close the global immunization gap, so as to truly safeguard people's lives, health and livelihoods. Guterres expressed his thanks to China for the country's contribution to improving vaccine accessibility in developing countries.</p> <p> China is the largest contributor to fair distribution of vaccines. As a country that delivers on its promises, China fully supports the UN target of administering vaccines to over 70 percent of the global population by mid-2022.</p> <p> So far, China has provided over 2.1 billion doses of vaccines for more than 120 countries and international organizations, becoming the biggest provider of outbound vaccines among all countries. Half of the vaccine doses administered around the world were made in China. Most of the vaccines received by many countries, especially developing countries, came from China.</p> <p> The vaccines provided by China have enhanced the capability, confidence and resolution of developing countries in the fight against the pandemic. Chief Executive of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization Seth Berkley called China's efforts an important contribution to the global fight against the virus.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0301/FOREIGN202203011351000530576777732.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 397px;" /></p> <p> <em>A new batch of anti-pandemic materials donated by the Chinese government to the Solomon Islands arrive in Honiara, capital of the Solomon Islands, Feb. 18, 2022.&nbsp;(Photo courtesy of the Chinese Embassy in Solomon Islands)</em></p> <p> China is a devoted practitioner of joint vaccine production. It is among the earliest to support the waiver of COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property rights and to transfer technologies to developing countries. It has launched joint vaccine production with 20 countries, with an annual production capacity of one billion doses.</p> <p> On Feb. 20, China and Egypt jointly donated 500,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Palestine. It marked the first time for Egypt to send its locally produced COVID-19 vaccines abroad. Egypt's acting Health Minister Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar introduced that Egypt has so far produced more than 30 million doses of the vaccine, and their safety and efficiency are guaranteed. Through concrete actions, China has enhanced the vaccine production capacity of developing countries, setting a exemplary model of solidarity in the fight against the pandemic.</p> <p> China is an active participant in multilateral cooperation on vaccines. It supports the World Health Organization in playing a central and coordinating role, and gives priority to the procurement needs of the COVAX Facility, to which China has supplied over 200 million doses of vaccines. China has also donated $100 million to the facility for the distribution of vaccines in developing countries.</p> <p> At the UNGA High-level Meeting on COVID-19 Vaccines, China proposed to build a "safety net" for immunity, build up anti-pandemic "arsenals," improve the "governance shield" for health and strengthen the "anchor of stability" for development, which demonstrated the country's firm support for multilateral cooperation.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> On its journey toward the goal of common prosperity, China has allowed some people to become prosperous first, and encouraged these people to inspire and give a helping hand to those following in their wake.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0301/FOREIGN202203011345000497459153162.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Local farmers pick vegetables at a planting base established by Guangping county, Handan city, north China’s Hebei province, for the purpose of helping farmers increase income, Feb. 24, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Cheng Xuehu)</em></p> <p> In April 2018, 20 farmers, who are also members of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in Huangdu village, Anji county, east China’s Zhejiang province, wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, saying that they would like to donate 15 million tea seedlings to people in poverty-stricken areas so as to help them become well-off in the way people in Huangdu village did.</p> <p> During the past few years, Huangdu village has not only donated tea seedlings to some once-impoverished regions, but sent technical instructors to help people who received the seedlings select and grow them as well as pick and dry tea leaves. As it turns out, these tea seedlings have not only helped the counties that received the tea seedlings become better-off, but sown the seeds of hope for a prosperous life in more areas.</p> <p> The story is a vivid demonstration of how people who become well-off first help the latecomers achieve prosperity.</p> <p> Achieving common prosperity for all Chinese people is an abiding commitment of the CPC.</p> <p> However, it should be noted that in China, a country with a vast territory and a large population, regions are different from one another in terms of natural resource endowment and foundation of development, which means that the goal of common prosperity is neither to bring prosperity to everyone simultaneously, nor to see that regions reach a certain level of affluence all at the same time.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0301/FOREIGN202203011346000046988608063.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 596px;" /></p> <p> <em>Embroiderers make embroideries with the techniques of Qiang ethnic group at a training base in Ningqiang county, Hanzhong city, northwest China’s Shaanxi province, Feb. 26, 2022.

(People’s Daily Online/Wu Tianwen)</em></p> <p> Different groups of people vary not only in terms of the level of prosperity they can potentially achieve, but also the length of time they need to achieve it. Furthermore, it would be impossible to develop all regions at the same pace because of the gaps in wealth that still exist between them.</p> <p> Therefore, the realization of common prosperity is a dynamic process of pushing ahead. Instead of bringing prosperity to everyone simultaneously, ensuring all regions reach the same level of affluence at the same time, and building an egalitarian or a welfare state, China’s goal of common prosperity requires a process of gradually achieving prosperity for all along a path featuring changes from the parts to the whole and from quantitative changes to qualitative transformation.</p> <p> In terms of the specific method, the country allows some people and regions to become prosperous first, and encourage them to provide assistance for those latecomers.</p> <p> Encouraging some people to embrace prosperity first, the country has invigorated its social and economic development, mobilized the enthusiasm of entrepreneurs, and facilitated the healthy development of various types of capital. Meanwhile, it has strived to help the latecomers to become well-off by promoting social equity, properly adjusting excessive income, and encouraging high-income groups and enterprises to give back to society, in a bid to gradually achieve common prosperity.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0301/FOREIGN202203011346000205353322249.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Tea farmers cultivate tea seedlings in Chun’an county, Hangzhou city, east China’s Zhejiang province, Feb. 26, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Wang Jianlin)</em></p> <p> Just as a happy life is achieved through hard work, common prosperity can only be created with ingenuity and effort. It is not something that will arrive naturally, but will only be realized through the joint efforts of all Chinese people.</p> <p> The country believes that only by encouraging people to increase income and become rich through hard work, honest labor, lawful operations, creating conditions that are more inclusive and fair for people to get better education and improve their development capabilities, and shaping a development environment that provides chances for more people to become wealthy, can it enable every person to enjoy self-development and serve society, and ensure equal opportunities for all to live a rewarding life and realize their dreams.</p> <p> On top of that, China plans to establish basic institutional arrangements enabling coordination and complementarity between the primary, secondary, and tertiary distribution and intensify efforts to regulate distribution through taxation, social insurance, and transfer payments while also working to make these efforts more precise, so as to make development more balanced, coordinated, and inclusive and the gains of development benefit all people in a more substantial and equitable way.</p> <p> Various kinds of market entities are the main participants in economic activities, the main providers of employment opportunities and the main promoters of technological progress, playing a very important role in national economic development.</p> <p> Enterprises, among all kinds of market entities, have not only economic and legal responsibilities, but social and moral ones.</p> <p> Only entrepreneurs who sincerely repay society and earnestly fulfill their social responsibilities can win social recognition and meet the needs of the times.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0301/FOREIGN202203011346000327682829711.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on July 15, 2021, shows a picturesque view of tea gardens and villages in Anji county, Huzhou city, east China’s Zhejiang province. (People’s Daily Online/Pan Xuekang)</em></p> <p> On the one hand, enterprises should carry out honest and lawful operations and create wealth for society, which is not only their primary duty, but a proper way to contribute to the goal of common prosperity.</p> <p> On the other hand, China encourages enterprises and social groups that have the intention and capability of participating in public-interest and charitable activities to actively take part in such activities and play a role in tertiary distribution. At the same time, the country fully respects enterprises’ free will to or not to make charitable donations, and will never pursue common prosperity by “killing the rich to help the poor”.</p> <p> The sure way for China to achieve common prosperity is to encourage some people and regions to become rich first through honest labor and lawful operations, and then help the rest of the Chinese people and regions embrace prosperity too, which also conforms to the laws underlying the development of human society.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Liu Jie)</em></p> <p> As if the supply of anti-China disinformation has exceeded the demand in the US, the American government decided to blow federal money to export it. On February 4, the US House of Representatives greenlighted the <em>America COMPETES Act</em>, in which a sum of 500 million dollars was allotted to "produce journalism for overseas audiences that is critical of China," according to <em>American Prospect</em>, a US-based magazine.</p> <p> <em>[Read More: <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0224/c90000-9962570.html" target="_blank"><u>A 500-million-dollar business! America's state-sponsored anti-China propaganda</u></a>]</em></p> <p> The move appears to be dangerous and desperate but not at all unforeseeable. It just marks a crescendo of the US' unrelenting and undisguised smear campaign against China. For years, the US has concocted piles of erroneous reports and made numerous groundless accusations. Negative coverage of China, at the tip of its disinformation iceberg, is merely <em>news</em>—it's a 24/7, all-season regular program that takes bias and negativity as its unchanging formula.</p> <p> To better understand the nature of America's slanted portraits of China, let's dig deep into the different tones and rhetoric recently adopted by US politicians and media outlets when it comes to similar issues.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0225/FOREIGN202202251545000127771259548.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 675px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>A police car blocking the road is seen in Ottawa, Canada, Feb. 10, 2022. (Xinhua/Lin Wei)</em></p> <p> Take the "Freedom Convoy" protest in Canada first. As a convoy of angry truckers crammed onto the roadway to blockade a key US-Canada border bridge and occupied the city center of Ottawa, this was what media from its neighboring country had to say: "By illegally occupying streets in downtown Ottawa, it has upended daily life in a city of 1 million people," a Washington Post editorial wrote. CNN cited a portfolio of polls and pinpointed that "a strong majority of Canadians oppose convoy protests."</p> <p> But bear in mind that roughly three years ago, when rioters jammed onto the main streets of China's Hong Kong, a city that is home to over 7 million people, vandalizing public facilities and wreaking havoc on the entire society, the same American media outlets joined forces to justify the barbaric riots as "peaceful protests," in total disregard of the daily life of Hong Kong residents (or did they really care?).</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0225/FOREIGN202202251600000170549333776.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> Another moment of American-style hypocrisy manifested itself when Amnesty International published an "apartheid" report on February 1. A report that is written by several "experts" and published by a "famed" international organization— should such a publication contain anything critical of China, the US media will go full steam ahead to manufacture thousands of pages of "convictions". But this time around the subject matter in that report is focused on Israel—one of America's closest allies. This article will not discuss the authoritativeness of that report. But just let's have a look at how the US side has since reacted. Following the release of the report, dozens of US legislators slammed it as "biased," "baseless" or "racist." The Wall Street Journal penned a lengthy editorial to denounce the report as "slander" and a distortion of history, while the New York Times, which has been vocal on the issue and adept at citing such reports, didn't publish a single word on the report. However, such indignation and "self-censorship" only happen when US allies are involved.</p> <p> After Adrian Zenz fabricated his fraudulent and groundless "Xinjiang report," US politicians and media outlets thronged together onto a self-stylized moral high ground. To blackwash a place that they only "surveyed" in the false report and pretend to care about a group of people they speak of only when it permits attacking China, they won't hesitate a second to deploy their hatred-rooted, bias-driven diction and labels.</p> <p> <em><strong>[Special Coverage: <a href="http://en.people.cn/102775/416801/index.html" target="_blank"><u>Rediscovering Xinjiang</u></a>]</strong></em></p> <p> Bias and bigotry have reached their peak in American media's slanted coverage of COVID-19. From the efficacy of China's COVID-19 vaccines to the effectiveness of China's epidemic control methods—never minding the lab leak conspiracy these people fabricated to frame up China in vain—they appear to have willfully set aside what little ethics they have and all of their objectivity when covering any issues pertaining to China.</p> <p> Every time China has achieved a milestone in its vaccination drive or donated a batch of its vaccines, the America-first media squad never once forgot to mention that Made-in-China vaccines are "inferior" or that China's vaccine donations were tantamount to nothing more than "vaccine diplomacy." But when COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates kept climbing on American soil even among previously vaccinated people, they blamed it on breakthrough cases. Through their gloomy lens, China's zero-COVID-19 strategy seems like a mess; and a dozen cases in China appear to be "destructive." Even when China kept infections at bay while holding the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games during a global PANDEMIC, the US media peddlers somehow managed to lend their criticism: the Games, they said, were "joyless."</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0225/FOREIGN202202251558000412614234701.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 540px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Endless slander/Illustration: Chen Xia/GT</em></p> <p> While the US adopted a negative stance on China's use of an Olympics "bubble" (a.k.a. its closed-loop epidemic management system), isn't the US creating and living in its own anti-China disinformation "bubble" where objectivity is absent, and where biases and Sinophobia flourish.</p> <p> Some US politicians and media might be willing to dwell indefinitely within this kind of negative environment filled with anti-China propaganda, and by allocating half a billion dollars in the course they are officially making it a business. One Reddit user commented satirically as quoted in the American Prospect article, openly expressing opposition to the US government's policies: "Propaganda to get the people to support war and the war machine! [A] Perfect way to spend our tax dollars!"</p> <p> But living in a toxic political space always has consequences. In a society brimming with disinformation and misinformation, how can the public find its moral compass in a time of crisis? When American media and US politicians spend more time, energy, and resources on slamming another country's COVID-19 vaccines and epidemic control methods while frequently boosting conspiracy theories, they have also fostered the "Frankenstein" side of the American crowd to attack the COVID-19 vaccines and restrictions deployed by their own country.</p> <p> Also, when the US is staging a relentless smear campaign against China, the entire Asian community has borne the brunt of the targeted hatred in American society. A recent report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism has found that anti-Asian hate crimes surged 339% in 2021, adding to the 150% hike that already occurred in 2020. By funding a campaign of badmouthing China and the country's people, the US will not only blur the line between objective news coverage and pro-American propaganda but will also obscure the limits between reality and falsehood, which risks reinforcing racism and bigotry that are already deep-rooted in the US.&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0225/FOREIGN202202251551000372812139230.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 505px;" /></p> <p> People denouncing hatred against the Asian American communities rally before San Gabriel Mission Playhouse in City of San Gabriel, Los Angeles County, California, the United States, March 20, 2021.

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> <em>500 million dollars</em>. That's the sum of money the US congress planned to allocate to churn out negative news coverage on China. First reported by <em>American Prospect</em> on Feb. 9, the bill was stuffed into the China-centered <em>America COMPETES Act </em>that just got passed by the US House of Representatives earlier this month. A majority of the half-billion-dollar fund will go to the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), a state-run media service that oversees Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe (RFE), and Radio Free Asia (RFA), which have a record of "blurring the line between objective news coverage and pro-American propaganda," the article wrote.</p> <p> The malicious plan constitutes a flagrant departure from the principles of "media independence" and "media objectivity" that are self-proclaimed by many in the US. It is tantamount to state-sponsored propaganda, which the superpower has borrowed—along with other dishonorable tactics, e.g., setting up a spy mission center targeting China—from previous approaches adopted during the Cold War era.</p> <p> <em>[Related Reading: <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/1021/c90000-9910045.html" target="_blank"><u>CIA's new China mission center takes a page from America's cold war playbook</u></a>]</em></p> <p> As early as 1946, a bulk of 19 million dollars was appropriated by the US Congress to offset the Soviet Union's "misrepresentation of the United States." Two years later, Congress passed the <em>Smith–Mundt Act </em>and earmarked 30 million dollars to "promote a better understanding of the United States in other countries." In 1953, a specific propaganda institution—the United States Information Agency (USIA)—was established to counter Soviet Union influence while seeding American <em>values</em>, which Dwight Eisenhower, then American president, described as "aspirations for freedom, progress, and peace."</p> <p> Meanwhile, RFE and VOA, the driving forces of America's propaganda machine, continued to extend their antennas behind the Iron Curtain. While both RFE and VOA purported to tell the "truth" to the world in an <em>objective </em>manner, they in practice "created an aura of American infallibility in which all of its opponents [were] portrayed as evil and grasping," as wrote Ralph A. Uttaro in his essay <em>The Voices of America in International Radio Propaganda</em>. Throughout their operation during the Cold War, RFE and VOA had repeatedly crossed the line between information and incitement (for example, RFE's broadcasts ahead of the Hungarian revolution in 1956 was viewed by many as encouraging citizens to revolt) and allowed the US government to heavily manipulate and fund their broadcasts, especially during the McCarthy era.</p> <p> The arrival of the 500-million-dollar bill to direct disinformation against China suggests that the US is preparing to reopen its Cold War toolbox to wage yet another propaganda campaign. Under the disguise of the "free press" and "objective reporting," the US is now eyeing a chance to sponsor its media squads to re-enact their role as an instigator rather than as a reporter. The concepts of journalistic credibility and independent reporting inlaid in the motto of American outlets like VOA couldn't be more ill-founded and satirical with the passage of such a propaganda bill. Anyone in the US who advocates for objectivity and neutrality in journalism should feel embarrassed.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> “Unlearning Helplessness”, the theme of the 58th Munich Security Conference (MSC) held from Feb. 18 to 20, reflected the anxiety of Western countries amid multiple crises, including flare-ups of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical tensions.</p> <p> It is an important issue how to overcome global challenges, find the right path to peaceful development and prevent collective helplessness from turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy, which tests the wisdom of various parties.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0223/FOREIGN202202230923000050318481898.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 800px;" /></p> <p> <em>Chen Mingjian (left), Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania, touches elbows with an official of Tanzania’s Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children during a handover ceremony of 500,000 doses of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines donated by the Chinese government to Tanzania at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania, Nov. 1, 2021. (Photo/Courtesy of Chinese Embassy in Tanzania)</em></p> <p> The themes of the MSC have largely mirrored the real social mentalities of Western countries. From the theme of “Westlessness” of the 56th MSC held in 2020 to this year’s theme of “Unlearning Helplessness”, the conference has paid continuous attention to uncertainties.</p> <p> As the Munich Security Report 2022 pointed out, many people in Western countries sensed that they are losing control over global events, and seem to conclude that it will not be possible to solve humanity’s most challenging problems.</p> <p> The sense of helplessness has root causes that shouldn’t be ignored. In fact, it is a widespread feeling in Western countries that emerged from the lack of solutions to global challenges, a result of their failure to make timely adjustments to respond to major changes unseen in a century.</p> <p> If countries squander the most powerful instruments for maintaining a rules-based international order and for fighting global security threats, namely institutions like the United Nations Security Council, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the World Health Organization (WHO), then their helplessness is truly self-inflicted, according to Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the MSC.</p> <p> To get rid of the sense of helplessness, countries should first embrace the right concept of security. As the interests of countries in the world are more and more closely intertwined, security issues are increasingly interconnected, transnational, and diverse. The scenario described in the Kazakh proverb that goes “Someone who tries to blow out another’s oil lamp will set his beard on fire” is the reality of the times.</p> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc across the world. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world has totaled over 400 million, while that of people killed by the disease has reached nearly six million.</p> <p> In order to win the final victory over the pandemic, various countries must adhere to the approach of solidarity and cooperation.</p> <p> Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions have made it more imperative to uphold dialogue and consultation and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility.</p> <p> Countries around the world must champion the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and abandon the wrong idea of exclusive security and absolute security.</p> <p> As the WHO pointed out, countries in the world need to cooperate with each other to tackle the common challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p> “Public statements should aim to reduce tensions, not inflame them,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the recent MSC.</p> <p> The long-term solution to the sense of helplessness is to safeguard multilateralism and international order.</p> <p> For some time, certain major country has revived the Cold War mentality and stoked confrontation between blocs, willfully imposed unilateral sanctions upon other countries and sabotaged international rule of law, formed various small circles and stirred up conflict and confrontation, been obsessed with “decoupling” and creating barriers and bucked the trend of globalization, and played up the position of strength and pursued hegemony and bullying.</p> <p> Such acts run counter to the general trend of multipolarity and greater democracy in international relations.</p> <p> State-to-state relations cannot be simply defined by competition. Countries in the world should never attempt to wind back the clock of history and repeat the past mistakes of building alliances and pursuing confrontation.</p> <p> They must make the right choice and work together to build a new type of international relations that feature mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation; they must be committed to promoting solidarity and cooperation, jointly advocate and practice true multilateralism, safeguard the authority of the UN, and abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. No country should replace international rules with its own will or place itself above international rules.</p> <p> This year’s MSC continued to include a special conversation with China, which focused on how to view China and China’s development.</p> <p> In the face of the protracted COVID-19 pandemic, China, steadfast in making COVID-19 vaccines a global public good, has provided more than 2.1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines for over 120 countries and international organizations.</p> <p> Against the backdrop of the turbulent international situation, China has followed the new thinking of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and persisted in solving various regional hotspot issues through political means, playing a constructive role in safeguarding international peace and security.</p> <p> Facts have shown that China, on its journey of higher-quality development and with stronger capacity to put plans into practice and fulfill promises, will certainly inject more impetus into the post-pandemic recovery of the world and make greater contribution to international peace and stability.</p> <p> As the world is going through intertwined waves of major changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, various countries are all in a giant ship on which their shared destiny hinges, instead of riding separately in small boats.</p> <p> Only when countries row the oars together and cheer up each other, rather than undercut and come after one another, can they overcome the current challenges and sail into a bright future.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

The two sides were at daggers drawn for decades prior to the battle, and most importantly—as Thucydides, who himself served as a general during the war, indicated—they constituted the curse of inescapable clashes: a ruling power and a rising power. Scholars and experts have since resorted to Thucydides' account to decipher historical conflicts (e.g., the two world wars) and predict future ones. Among them is American political scientist Graham Allison, who invented the famous <em>Thucydides Trap</em> to describe a prospective conflict between the world's two biggest economies—the US and China.</p> <p> A decade has passed since Mr. Allision coined the term, and yet the two nations have shown little tendency towards falling victim to the trap. True, the China-US relations have encountered occasional obstacles over the course of the past decade, but most of these are predictable and manageable; and leaders from both sides have on multiple occasions cautioned against any kind of conflict. Even at a time when the US is throwing its trade and diplomacy tantrums, China has exercised considerable restraint and made its utmost efforts to steer the bilateral relations away from unrepairable rupture.</p> <p> That, however, doesn't stop some US politicians and media outlets from incessantly rehashing the misconception that the <em>China threat </em>is looming on the horizon and that unless the US acts forcefully to squash it, the superpower is going to lose big.</p> <p> Is this really the case?</p> <p> If we pay heed to America's record of demonizing and bullying the no.2 nation in the name of curbing external threats (to American jobs, national security, or the so-called "American values") we will find that most of its "threat narratives" have been established on the same perpetual fear that an ascendant runner-up nation will outcompete the superpower and eventually imperil its supremacy. It was with that unprovoked paranoia, combined with its zero-sum mindset, that the US had wielded its big stick to stifle competition from Germany, Japan, and the EU in the past. Trade tariffs, exclusion bills, sanctions, delisting, xenophobic propaganda, etc.—these aren't new inventions designed to target China, but old practices borrowed from its past <em>triumphs</em>.</p> <p> However, by forging a resemblance between China and America's previous "challengers" and crying wolf over it, the US has fundamentally mistaken the reality of the situation and miscalculated China's intention.</p> <p> China is by no means on par with the US economically and therefore shouldn't be falsely portrayed as the latter's rival. American pundits are fixated on citing the GDP, trade volumes, and foreign exchange reserves as evidence of the mounting "China threat," but what they refuse to acknowledge is the fact that all the aforementioned metrics, once divided by 1.4 billion, will send China to the middle-income country category. As Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng correctly pointed out at the Macro Situation Annual Forum held in Beijing on January 18 that, some one billion Chinese have never flown in an airplane, over 200 million Chinese families don't have a flush toilet, and only less than 4% of Chinese people have a college degree (by contrast, around one in four Americans have one). China, after all, still is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, a developing country.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0210/FOREIGN202202101026000060490505859.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 580px;" /></p> <p> <em>Poverty relief assistants Liu Ying (1st L) and He Changle (2nd L), as well as village officers, help carry melons planted by villagers in Dongqin Village, Congjiang County of southwest China's Guizhou Province, Nov. 11, 2020. (Xinhua/Yang Wenbin)</em></p> <p> Another reason why China is on no trajectory to dethrone the US from its position of global <em>supremacy </em>is that China has never harbored such an intention. Having just lifted all its people out of poverty and built itself into a moderately prosperous society, China remains preoccupied with its own agenda—that is, meeting people's aspirations for a better life—rather than involving itself in unrealistic and costly contentions for power. On the other hand, as a staunch supporter of multilateralism, China has long been committed to building a community of a shared future for mankind, instead of embracing isolationism and hegemony for geopolitical gains. In practice, China's policymaking revolves around its people, not a single political party; and its global presence is focused on delivering benefits for the whole world, rather than a particular alliance of nations. China and the US are like two poles apart celestial bodies—one is revolving on its own axis and along the common orbit, while the other is engrossed with creating its own system and order. How could the two possibly collide?</p> <p> It is wise to draw lessons from history. But blindly drawing parallels between the past and the present and acting accordingly is imprudent and dangerous. China-US relations have nothing in common with previous declining-and-rising-powers relations. China, in its long history, has never been a hegemon. It has never initiated wars or invaded foreign lands. It seeks no regional clout or geopolitical sway. It cares more about the interests of its own people and the universally recognized norms and values than outcompeting any other nation. Therefore, it is beyond all reason for the US to designate China as the major player of its competition game when China, which has been engrossed with its own mission, is averse to join.</p> <p> On Feb. 4, the US government passed the so-called "China Competition Bill," a multibillion-dollar package designed to <em>cement </em>its "economic competitiveness." The passage of the bill came as no surprise since the only bills that can be greenlighted in US Congress nowadays are all about China. As the Wall Street Journal pungently pointed out, it is a "Be More Like China Act," a duplicate of China's "industrial policy." The bill, together with other China-focused bills proposed by the Biden Administration, gets only one thing right: touching upon domestic affairs and people's welfares. Those bills, whatever their hidden agenda, at least remind the US government that there are still roads to be rebuilt, bridges to be fixed, inflation to be curbed, and climate puzzles to be solved. But the US should understand that the China threat rhetoric isn't the cure for any of these problems, and obsessing with power contention narratives won't help the US to avert Thucydides Trap (or any traps), it will only get the US struck in the <em>Thucydides Trap</em> trap: its persistent zero-sum mindset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0210/FOREIGN202202101026000392541597896.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> Photo taken on May 28, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building behind traffic lights in Washington, D.C., the United States.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)</em></p> <p> He elaborated upon the right direction in which the international community can work jointly to defeat the pandemic, the ultimate solution to promoting steady recovery of the world economy, practical approach to bridging the development divide and suggestions for countries to get along with each other.</p> <p> His remarks showed China’s firm determination to work together with the rest of the world to survive the trying times and jointly create a better post-COVID world.</p> <p> “As a Chinese saying goes, ‘The momentum of the world either flourishes or declines; the state of the world either progresses or regresses.’ The world is always developing through the movement of contradictions; without contradiction, nothing would exist. The history of humanity is a history of achieving growth by meeting various tests and of developing by overcoming various crises. We need to move forward by following the logic of historical progress, and develop by riding the tide of development of our times,” said Xi at the virtual session.</p> <p> Xi’s insightful remarks embody the scientific methodology of dialectical materialism, providing important guidance for grasping the trend of history and riding the waves of the times in the turbulent international situation.</p> <p> Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, believes that Xi’s speech pointed the way to a better future for China and the world.</p> <p> In the face of profound and extensive changes of the times, countries can only see clearly the right direction for human society through the “telescope” of history.</p> <p> Although the once-in-a-century pandemic has created many obstacles to the communication between peoples of different countries, facts have shown once again that countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which their shared destiny hinges. Only through cooperation can they usher in a brighter future.</p> <p> The recovery and development of the world economy are faced with many constraints, but economic globalization has never and will not veer off course. Only by building an open world economy can countries fully unleash the vitality of the world economy.</p> <p> Although problems like a widening North-South gap, divergent recovery trajectories, development fault-lines and technology divisions become more prominent, mankind’s beautiful dream of common development will never fade. Only by adhering to a people-centered philosophy of development can countries realize balanced development worldwide and revitalize global development.</p> <p> Despite the resurgence of Cold War mentality, protectionism and unilateralism, peaceful development and win-win cooperation remain the right way forward for humanity. Different countries and civilizations can open up new space for global peaceful development only by prospering together on the basis of respect for each other, and seeking common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences.</p> <p> In the face of the profound and sweeping changes of the times, the international community must forge ahead with confidence and fortitude and push the wheel of history toward a brighter future with practical actions.</p> <p> To take the initiative in the course of history, countries must pluck up the courage to overcome stubborn resistance and strong countercurrents along the way for a better future.</p> <p> “We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges,” Xi said at the event.</p> <p> He encouraged the international community to face the issues of the times and create a better future with actions.</p> <p> Crises and opportunities are interconnected and dialectically united. Only by figuring out the way forward, grasping the general trend, observing the situation through dialectical thinking, gaining a deep understand of opportunities and challenges and actively creating conditions can countries turn crises into opportunities.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of COVID-19, people from various countries have supported and helped each other, showing humankind’s courage, resolve and compassion in front of a major crisis and kindling a flame in the dark hour.</p> <p> To build a better post-COVID world, the international community also needs to join hands to surmount all kinds of obstacles on the way forward with courage and strong will.</p> <p> Throughout the history of humanity, human society has managed to progress no matter what kinds of risks, disasters or countercurrents were along the way. Humanity shall and will continue to stride forward.</p> <p> As long as various parties follow the trend of history, embrace cooperation to defeat the virus, resolve various risks, bridge the development divide, and discard Cold War mentality, the international community will certainly create a better post-COVID world.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

Last year, the country’s foreign trade surpassed the $5 trillion and $6 trillion marks, compared with over $4 trillion in the previous year.</p> <p> China’s imports and exports with major trading partners achieved stable increase, and its trade models were further optimized in 2021.</p> <p> During last year, private enterprises in the country played a more active role in foreign trade; the country’s imports and exports of mechanical and electrical products maintained a sound growth momentum; and the actual use of foreign capital in China’s high-tech industry and service sector climbed 17.1 percent and 16.7 percent respectively from the previous year. The country’s foreign trade and foreign investment inflow achieved steady improvement in both quantity and quality.</p> <p> Against the background characterized by the blows of a massive epidemic, faster evolution of major changes unseen in a century in the world, and the increasingly complex, grim and uncertain external environment, China’s economy has maintained stable operation, with the foundation for industrial development constantly consolidated and vitality of economic development enhanced.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0119/FOREIGN202201190926000039540918039.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Customers select imported products in a convenience shop at Caofeidian comprehensive bonded zone, Tangshan city, north China’s Hebei province, Dec. 13, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/ Liu Mancang)</em></p> <p> Many international economic organizations predicted that the year-on-year growth of China’s economy in 2021 surpassed the expected growth of other major economies.</p> <p> China’s lead in the world in terms of COVID-19 containment has been a key underlying factor behind its globally leading position in pursuing economic development.</p> <p> Faced with repeated variations of the virus, China sticks to the overall strategy of preventing imported cases and domestic re-infections and the “dynamic zero-case policy”, and continuously improves the vaccination coverage, laying solid underpinning for balancing epidemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development.</p> <p> China has not only achieved stable operation of its own economy, but helped maintain the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain together with its trading partners, effectively propping up global fight against the virus and world economic recovery.</p> <p> China’s role as an anchor and driver for the world economy is becoming more evident, which proves that China’s insistence on effectively coordinating COVID-19 responses with economic and social development and implementing prudent macroeconomic policies, a truly responsible move taken by a major country, is conducive to the recovery and development of the world economy.</p> <p> China’s “magnetic attraction” to foreign investment continues to increase, demonstrating huge opportunities offered by the country’s super-large market.</p> <p> China has a population of more than 1.4 billion and a middle-income group of more than 400 million people, which makes the scale and potential of its consumer market unparalleled. Besides, as the country boasts complete industrial supporting facilities, sound infrastructure, rich human resources and other prominent advantages, and has constantly improved its business environment, it will show greater appeal to foreign investors.</p> <p> In 2022, China’s foreign direct investment (FDI) is expected to remain robust, according to a report recently released by KPMG.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0119/FOREIGN202201190926000148614841431.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Containers are loaded and unloaded at a well-lit container terminal of Haikou port, south China’s Hainan province, Oct. 20, 2021.

Senior executives of many American enterprises also announced that they will expand their business in China in the next decade.</p> <p> By advocating open cooperation and promoting the construction of an open world economy, China has enabled the rest of the world to share the dividends of its economic growth and prosperous consumption.</p> <p> In 2021, the imports and exports of China’s comprehensive bonded zones, pilot free trade zones, and Hainan free trade port grew 24.3 percent, 26.4 percent, and 57.7 percent, respectively, signaling greater importance of the country’s platforms set up to promote opening-up.</p> <p> China’s foreign trade with countries along the Belt and Road rose 23.6 percent year on year to 11.6 trillion yuan last year, 2.2 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of China’s foreign trade in the same period. The unimpeded trade between China and countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fully demonstrated how the high-quality joint construction of the BRI can stimulate the development of the world economy.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

Facing a fresh wave of the highly contagious Omicron variant, countries are grappling to safeguard their citizens against infection—each in their own way. There are nations that have stuck to the Zero-COVID strategy in a bid to minimize transmission. There are countries that have rushed to <em>boost </em>their public with a view to reaching an optimal state of herd immunity.</p> <p> Then there is the American strategy, a hotchpotch of inaction and counteraction that has plunged the nation into a public health anarchy. The COVID-19 map says it all. Zooming in on any coronavirus hot spot graphics, and you will find that, for most of the past two years, the American part dyed in ominous burgundy. With an appalling daily tally of some 800 thousand cases (nearly 140,000 COVID-19 patients have been hospitalized every single day), the US is marching at an alarming pace toward establishing its own model of<em> herd immunity</em>—not by vaccination but through<em> mass infection</em>.</p> <p> America's COVID-19 fiasco, a slow-motion tragedy where everything that could go wrong has gone wrong, has been jointly inflicted by its incompetent and irresolute politicians, the divided and centrifugal states, as well as the misleading and conflicting media and so-called pundits.</p> <p> It is a self-fulfilling prophecy when dereliction of duty goes unchecked and apathy to human life and science is tolerated or even applauded.</p> <p> Back in early 2020, former US President Donald Trump eagerly dismissed the infectious disease as a hoax hatched by the Democrats and a "Kung Flu," having opted instead to throw more energy behind his own reelection bid than to urge the public to wear masks and get vaccinated. Under his watch, the US lost over 400,000 lives to the disease, of which at least 130,000 people died unnecessarily, according to Deborah Birx, Trump's former coronavirus response coordinator.</p> <p> But has former US President Trump been held to account for his mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis? Not in the slightest. He was in fact been impeached twice and is still in the crosshairs for his role in the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Yet he escaped scot-free from the public health disaster he left behind.</p> <p> The former New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, has also taken his spot in the long line of politicians who have not been held accountable for their negligence in bungling the COVID-19 response. Last year, the star governor resigned in disgrace. His undoing? Harassment allegations, rather than the fact that he ordered nursing homes to take back infected residents, letting the virus loose in those most vulnerable places in his state. Unlike Trump, he was subject to an investigation for his role in the state's nursing home horror. But the result that came out earlier this month found that he was not liable for any criminal charges.</p> <p> Also, the same goes for Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who himself was infected with the virus last August and yet has still spared in no effort to block every vaccine or mask mandate. Not to mention Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who let almost a million rapid COVID-19 tests expire as they sat idly in a warehouse. And congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently received what has been her only dose of punishment—permanently suspension from Twitter—after waging her misinformation frenzy on the social media platform (including concocting a falsehood that there has been "extremely high amounts" of COVID-vaccine-related deaths)…</p> <p> Do these politicians really have grave doubts over vaccine efficacy? Clearly not. Greg Abbott received his booster and Ron DeSantis has gotten at least two shots (he refused to clarify whether he is boosted). Yet they would rather shirk their responsibility to nudge the public to follow suit, which will have ZERO consequences, other than offending anti-vaccination voters, which would otherwise taint their political future.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0117/FOREIGN202201171659000106011272717.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 665px;" /></p> <p> <em>People wait for COVID-19 test in the Queens borough of New York, United States, Dec. 29, 2021. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)</em></p> <p> When politicians refuse or fail to devise and implement a clear roadmap, then chances are that baffled and worn-out citizens will make selfish decisions in the name of freedom. Meanwhile, the media will feed the furor and profit from this costly freedom under the banner of "freedom of speech"—when no one, in the end, is to be held responsible for spewing out misinformation.</p> <p> Just take a look at the star-struck Fox News channel, a petri dish of COVID-related "alternative facts," where masks, vaccine mandates, social distancing rules, and school closures taken as preemptive measures are often the subject of censuring in shows hosted by celebrity anchors. For Fox News hosts, facts appear to matter far less than political grandstanding. When they constantly churn out conspiracy theories or anti-science rhetoric that clearly go against CDC guidelines and even common sense, their staunch viewers ultimately bear the brunt—a Kaiser Family Foundation study has found 36% of surveyed Fox News views either believed in or were unsure about four or more false statements, one of the highest. Still, there is zero accountability.</p> <p> Voters and viewers take sides, but the virus respects no party affiliations. It feeds on misinformation and it flourishes when politicians are unaccountable and the media and so-called pundits trade in science-based facts for ratings. When politicians and celebrity hosts have nothing to lose, they of course won't prioritize people's lives in the first place.</p> <p> On January 3, the US logged a horrific record of one million cases, an astronomical number compared to most countries' case counts. As of January 16, over 850,000 lives have been lost to COVID-19 in America. It's tragic, it's alarming and it's above all sickening. With the US keen on slamming China's Zero-COVID strategy, why not save some energy to reexamine its own laissez-faire and zero-accountability approach first?&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

Looking back on China’s over six years of preparations for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, the country, guided by the vision of hosting “green, inclusive, open and clean” Olympic Winter Games, has made continuous efforts and steady progress with every passing day, which makes it more confident and better prepared during the sprint for the sports event.</p> <p> All 12 competition venues for the Beijing 2022 filled with sci-tech elements are completed, and operation teams of the venues are already in the Games-time state.</p> <p> The finishing touches to and improvements on non-competition venues are gathering pace, and the three Olympic Villages for the Beijing 2022 are well dressed. Besides, the renovation of venues for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Beijing 2022 has been successfully completed.</p> <p> The Beijing, Yanqing, and Zhangjiakou competition zones of the Beijing 2022, which are located in Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the co-host city in north China’s Hebei province, are all ready to welcome guests from across the world.</p> <p> From Oct. 5 to the end of December last year, eight of the 12 competition venues hosted 10 international competitions, three training weeks and two domestic trials in an orderly manner, with the aim of testing all factors of the Games. These competitions and activities were joined by over 2,000 overseas athletes, team officials, and other personnel.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0118/FOREIGN202201180905000582115722486.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 618px;" /></p> <p> <em>Children practice skating under the instruction of a coach at a park in Urumqi, northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Jan. 9, 2022.

It is great to see their feedback both on the technical side and their personal excitement,” he said.</p> <p> China is stretching out its arms to greet outstanding winter sports athletes from various countries. These athletes, who have superb athletic skills gained through repeated practice and are pursuing beautiful dreams with perseverance, will gather together in China under the Olympic flag.</p> <p> Athletes are both opponents in competitions and messengers of the Olympic values of excellence, friendship, respect, and solidarity. They inspire each other and help each other improve their performance.</p> <p> Olympic Games are like a miniature version of the global village, where athletes, while trying their best for dreams and honor, live under the same roof in Olympic Villages. By communicating with each other, they get to know the distinctive charms of different cultures and sow the seeds of peace, friendship and progress in all directions, turning the world into a united team.</p> <p> Aiming to link countries more closely via sports, the Beijing 2022 serves as a grand stage where numerous good stories will take place.</p> <p> In 2021, the IOC amended the Olympic motto for the first time in over a century, adding into which the word “together”. The new motto now reads “Faster, Higher, Stronger-Together”.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0118/FOREIGN202201180906000133052511700.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Foreigners take selfies with official mascots of the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games—Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon in Beijing, Jan. 12, 2022.

People in various countries are looking forward to the opening of the Beijing 2022, which will be an occasion when the value of passion and dreams, courage and strength, as well as teamwork and solidarity will be applauded by the whole world.</p> <p> Let us all expect the moment when the Olympic torch lights up the sky in Beijing and makes the flame of hope shine in everyone’s heart.</p> <p> Let us all work together for a shared future!&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo/Hubei Daily)</em></p> <p> Over a month ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping summarized the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation at the eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, where he also raised four proposals to build a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.</p> <p> At the conference, he announced that China will work closely with African countries to implement nine programs of China-Africa practical cooperation.</p> <p> After the conference concluded, a series of relevant activities were held, including the 2021 China-Africa Innovation Cooperation Conference, and the launching of a group of China-Africa Joint Centers for Modern Agrotechnology Exchange, Demonstration &amp;Training.</p> <p> China and Eritrea decided to elevate their relations to a strategic partnership. China and Kenya inked a series of cooperation documents on digital economy, investment, agriculture and export of Kenyan agricultural products to China. Besides, China said it would help the Comoros achieve universal immunization within a year, completely eliminate malaria in the Comoros by 2025, and support the Comoros Emerging Plan for 2030.</p> <p> These concrete actions to implement the outcomes of the eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation are deepening and substantiating the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.</p> <p> The mutual assistance and solidarity demonstrated by China and Africa amid the COVID-19 pandemic manifests the spirit of building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has offered 120 batches of emergency medical supplies for 53 African countries and the African Union (AU), delivering these materials to each and every African country and region. Besides, almost all African countries have received China’s COVID-19 vaccines.</p> <p> When Africa was facing a new round of COVID-19 resurgence, President Xi announced that China will provide another one billion doses of vaccines to Africa, to help the AU achieve its goal of vaccinating 60 percent of the African population by 2022.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0112/FOREIGN202201120907000441039765127.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Photo shows the Kipevu Oil Terminal in Mombasa, Kenya. (Photo/CGTN)</em></p> <p> At present, this largest-ever aid plan for Africa is well underway. Batches of Chinese vaccines are being shipped to every corner of the African continent, crossing mountains and seas.</p> <p> These actions prove that China will always stand firmly with Africa and work with it to achieve the final victory in the fight against the pandemic.</p> <p> China is the largest developing country, and Africa is the continent with the largest number of developing countries. The mutual assistance between the two sides when they are pursuing economic development and national rejuvenation will help enhance the common welfare of the 2.7 billion people in both China and Africa.</p> <p> China has always been following the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pursuing the greater good and shared interests in its cooperation with Africa. The two sides have built over 10,000 kilometers of railways, nearly 100,000 kilometers of highways, nearly 1,000 bridges and 100 ports, as well as a large number of hospitals and schools.</p> <p> Recently, a Chinese company built oil terminal at the port of Mombasa, Kenya was completed. It is another witness to the sincere friendship between China and Africa and a joyful result of the cooperation between the two sides under the Belt and Road Initiative, heralding a bright prospect of the two sides on their way to modernization.</p> <p> As long as China and Africa keep maintaining their solidarity and cooperation, they will definitely explore a new path for developing countries to achieve modernization.</p> <p> Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said he is often asked why Kenya and China cooperate so closely, and he told them, because China and Kenya respect each other and treat each other as equals. What he said exactly explains why China and Africa enjoy sustaining friendship and cooperation.</p> <p> China never attaches political strings in its cooperation with Africa, or forces the latter to do anything. The country always sees Africa as a broad stage for international cooperation rather than an arena for competition among major countries. If there is any competition, then we should compare who has done more for Africa, who has contributed more to Africa, and who has worked more for the African people.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0112/FOREIGN202201120907000329919596048.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Photo shows the Kipevu Oil Terminal in Mombasa, Kenya. (Photo/CGTN)</em></p> <p> China is sincere in offering assistance to African countries, and is willing to cooperate with all countries in the world to develop Africa. The African people know clearly who their real friend is. President of Eritrea Isaias Afwerki called China an indispensable and true development partner of Africa, and hoped that China could play a bigger role in Africa's peace and development process.</p> <p> The spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation, which features sincere friendship and equality, win-win for mutual benefit and common development, fairness and justice, and progress with the times and openness and inclusiveness, will be carried on from generation to generation.</p> <p> Joining hands for modernization and the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, China and Africa will surely write a glorious chapter in the history of human civilization.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Xie Huanchi)</em></p> <p> Xi’s remarks have fully demonstrated China’s confidence in fulfilling its solemn commitment to the international community to deliver a successful Beijing 2022 and manifested the aspiration of a positive, prosperous and open China to embrace the world and create a beautiful future together with the rest of the world.</p> <p> Hosting a successful 2022 Games is China’s delightful promise to the world. On July 31, 2015, Beijing, together with Zhangjiakou city in north China’s Hebei province, won the bid to host the 24th Olympic Winter Games, also known as the 2022 Winter Olympics, at the 128th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session.</p> <p> On the same day, Xi sent a congratulatory letter to the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games bid delegation, stressing that China will strive to deliver a fantastic, extraordinary and excellent Olympics in 2022.</p> <p> “We will fulfill all our commitments and witness, together with the people of all countries and the IOC, the advent of a new phase in the development of the Olympic winter sports and in the spread of the Olympic spirit,” said Xi in his letter to IOC President Thomas Bach on July 31, 2015.</p> <p> Over the past more than six years, China has made unremitting efforts to fulfill its solemn commitment to the international community. The country has promoted the ideas of hosting the Games in a green, sharing, open and clean manner and delivering a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic Games.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0111/FOREIGN202201110911000508553692599.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 675px;" /></p> <p> <em>The first train custom-made for the Beijing Winter Olympics sets off from Qinghe Railway Station in Beijing on the high-speed railway linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the co-host cities of the 2022 Winter Games, Jan. 6, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Shi Wenzhe)</em></p> <p> The IOC has always made positive remarks on China’s preparations for the Beijing 2022 and fully acknowledged the country’s contribution to the international Olympic cause.</p> <p> In October 2016, Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., Chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games and then vice president of the IOC, praised the Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games for getting off to a very fast start in the preparatory work and pointed out that initial preparations were on the right track.</p> <p> After visiting proposed venues for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in Zhangjiakou and Beijing before a meeting with Xi in January 2019, Bach said he was deeply impressed with China’s pragmatic, efficient, and vitalized preparations for the Games.</p> <p> “We are looking forward to successful Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and we have great confidence, built on our experience, that we will stage safe and secure Olympic Winter Games for everybody,” Bach said in his New Year’s Message 2022 published on the IOC official website on Dec. 31, 2021. He believes that “these Winter Games will open a new era for winter sports globally.”</p> <p> In a recent interview with Chinese media, Samaranch said he believes that China will stage a splendid Olympic Games for the world.</p> <p> Filled with confidence in China, the international community is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Beijing 2022 and looks forward to new surprises Beijing has prepared for the world.</p> <p> In 2008, China successfully hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which represented a perfect answer given by the country to the third of the well-known three questions raised by “Tianjin Youth” magazine in 1908: “When could China send an athlete to participate in an Olympic Games?” “When could China send a delegation to an Olympic Games?” “When could China host an Olympic Games?”</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0111/FOREIGN202201110912000178937636848.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Elementary school students practice skiing skills at a ski resort in Altay city, northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Jan. 6, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Aldark)</em></p> <p> This year, the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people will embrace the Olympic Movement again. By delivering a “fantastic, extraordinary and excellent” Olympics in 2022, China will promote the popularization and development of ice and snow sports and enhance understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and peoples of various countries around the world.</p> <p> Over the past years, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway connecting the three competition zones of the Beijing 2022, the world’s first intelligent high-speed train with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, was officially put into operation; the National Ski Jumping Center and the National Speed Skating Oval, which are nicknamed the “Snow Ruyi” and the “Ice Ribbon” respectively, were completed; the National Aquatics Center, known as the “Water Cube”, was transformed into “Ice Cube” for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games; and the country’s vision of engaging 300 million people in winter sports across China has been realized ahead of schedule.</p> <p> Through these achievements made during the preparations for the Beijing 2022, people around the world have witnessed how the Chinese people have worked hard for their dreams in the new era.</p> <p> As the COVID-19 is still wreaking havoc worldwide, the Beijing 2022 bears the task of deepening mutual understanding and exchanges between peoples around the world through the Olympic Movement.</p> <p> In December 2021, the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Beijing Winter Olympic Truce Resolution drafted by China and the IOC. The resolution expressed “the expectation that the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will be a meaningful opportunity to harness the power of sport to advance the world by fostering an atmosphere of peace, development, resilience, tolerance and understanding.”</p> <p> Many multilateral mechanisms, including the 10th Olympic Summit, the Group of 20, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the China-CELAC Forum, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have voiced strong support for the Beijing 2022.</p> <p> The international community’s support for the Games has demonstrated the aspiration of various parties to pull together in times of trouble, defeat the pandemic, safeguard peace, and work together for a shared future.</p> <p> It’s believed that the Beijing 2022 will be an unforgettable occasion when the world will be brought together in the Olympic spirit of peace, solidarity and friendship.</p> <p> The heroic motto of the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Games, “Together for a Shared Future”, represents China’s sincere invitation to various parties to join hands on the way forward.</p> <p> China will surely live up to the expectations of the IOC, which believes Beijing is a “safe and historical” choice for hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, and the Beijing 2022 will make a big splash in the history of the Olympic Movement.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

(People’s Daily Online/Han Jiajun)</em></p> <p> As the most promising free trade area covering the largest population and most diverse membership, the RCEP fully demonstrates the confidence and resolution of relevant parties in jointly safeguarding multilateralism and free trade, and promoting regional economic integration.</p> <p> It will further integrate industrial and supply chains in the region and promote cross-border trade and investment, injecting new momentum for regional and global economic recovery.</p> <p> The world is going through profound changes and a pandemic unseen in a century, and economic globalization running up against headwinds from rising unilateralism and protectionism.</p> <p> Member countries of the RCEP, which have different social systems, come from different cultural backgrounds, and are in different development stages, have implemented the modern, comprehensive, high-quality, and mutually beneficial free trade agreement as scheduled.</p> <p> They once again proved with concrete actions that economic globalization is irreversible, and openness and integration an unstoppable historical trend. They also proved that to safeguard multilateralism, adhere to opening cooperation, promote free trade and strive for common prosperity is a common aspiration of regional countries and their peoples, as well as the right choice to cope with challenges and promote win-win cooperation.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0106/FOREIGN202201060912000315275871370.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 645px;" /></p> <p> <em>A representative of the Liuzhou branch of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade issues the first RCEP Certificate of Origin in Liuzhou, south China’s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, to Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor, Jan. 1, 2022.

With a number of promises made on the opening of cargo and service trade, as well as investment, the free trade pact offers institutional guarantee for trade and investment facilitation, and more than 90 percent of merchandise trade between approved members will eventually be subject to zero tariffs under the pact.</p> <p> The RCEP will further integrate the industrial and supply chains in the Asia-Pacific region, energize regional investment, and give play to the complementary advantages of member countries in technology, manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors.</p> <p> The RCEP is expected to help its members increase export, stocks of outbound investment and GDP by 10.4 percent, 2.6 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, compared with the baseline, by 2025. This will greatly mitigate the negative impacts from COVID-19 on regional economy and enhance the confidence of the world in economic recovery.</p> <p> Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanawisit noted that the implementation of the RCEP will create a favorable external environment for the development of its member countries and enhance their resilience in coping with economic challenges.</p> <p> The RCEP implementation marks a new milestone for China's opening-up. As the largest economy among the members of the free trade agreement, China has conformed to the trend of regional cooperation and development, and was the first to have ratified the RCEP.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0106/FOREIGN202201060912000441994182807.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 674px;" /></p> <p> <em>Vehicles are being loaded onto an oceangoing roll-on-roll-off ship for exportation at a terminal in Lianyungang, east China’s Jiangsu province, Jan. 3, 2022.

It imports around $2.5 trillion of merchandise and services on an annual basis. The country will provide broader market space for regional economic development and support it with a diverse industrial system, and better join the integrated development of industrial and supply chains in the region and the construction of an integrated market, so as to contribute its strength to the promotion of regional prosperity and global recovery.</p> <p> China, unswervingly promoting high-level opening up, has demonstrated the confidence and inclusiveness of a major country, as well as its broad mind to seek interests for all.</p> <p> Implementing a free trade zone upgrading strategy and forging a network of high-standard free trade zones are important measures of China to build a new system for higher-level open economy and foster a new development paradigm.</p> <p> So far, China has inked free trade pacts with 26 partners, and its trade volume with these partners account for around 35 percent of the country’s total. It is seeing comprehensive improvement in its cargo and service trade, investment, as well as institutional openness.</p> <p> The RCEP will serve as a bridge for China that connects domestic and international circulations, and brings closer both domestic and international markets and resources. It will better align domestic and international rules, and further vitalize the country’s opening up and innovation.</p> <p> As long as China conforms to economic globalization to create opportunities while opening up and tackle problems through cooperation, and to work with other countries with strong confidence, it will be able to dispel the shadow cast by the COVID-19 pandemic over the global economy and create a brighter future together with the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0105/FOREIGN202201051610000294591007433.jpg" style="width: 750px; height: 775px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Combo photo shows the same models and actors with (bottom) and without slanted-eyes makeup</em></p> <p> <strong>--It's poles apart between "slanted eyes"—which is the product of makeup or racist gestures—and "small, narrow, or thin" eyes, which some people are born with naturally and shouldn't be ashamed of.</strong></p> <p> There is something that can catch me off guard whenever I watch a Hollywood film or stream a TV show in foreign languages: the Chinese characters, the Chinese elements, the Chinese <em>food</em>… As much as I am amused by how irrelevantly the Chinese proverbs are recited or how bizarrely Chinese cuisine is cooked and consumed, I often find myself cringing at the way those Chinese cast members look—foxy eyes, high cheekbones, flat faces with heavy makeup—in troupes, in sequels, in series. If there is a cinematic universe of Chinese characters, the audience must have trouble telling them apart.</p> <p> Every now and then, that feeling overflows from the big screen and lands on a random fashion show, a magazine cover, or a printout of a commercial poster. One question tugs on my mind: why do Chinese have to "look" (or be portrayed) like <em>that</em>—all the time? That's why I can't appreciate commercials made by Three Squirrels (a Chinese snack retailer) or Mercedes-Benz, both of which feature models with cosmetics-induced slanted eyes.</p> <p> My bewilderment arises not from how grotesque their countenances are (they sure have their own styles should they appear in personal makeup tutorials), but from the fact that by appearing in popular commercials with <em>cosmetics-induced</em> slanted eyes, they, unconsciously, are reinforcing a stereotype originated a century ago—that slanted eyes represent the common feature, the unique <em>beauty </em>shared by Chinese people.</p> <p> The stereotypical depiction of Chinese could find its roots as early as the 19th century when Sinophobia and exclusionism were at their height in the West. The infamous racist cartoon <em>The Yellow Terror in all His Glory </em>published in 1899 illustrated just how Chinese people (and in a broader concept non-white) were vilified—a skinny figure with slanted and angry eyes who was presented as a menace to the Western world.</p> <p> Even after China rose up against imperialism and started to assimilate itself into the world, that stereotype persisted. Not only were Chinese women often pigeonholed as the "China Doll" and Chinese men as the killers who specialized in Kung Fu, but they were also often treated as common tropes in Hollywood films like <em>The Face of Fu Manchu</em>, a 1965 thriller, with sallow faces and slanted eyes, all intentionally "fine-tuned" through makeup.</p> <p> "Slanted eyes" isn't just a racist symbol of the past, it is a stereotypical cliché that flourishes to this day. In the modern fashion industry, a pair of slanted eyes can be deemed as a classic beauty typology; and sometimes, it becomes the vogue for models to compete to appropriate from this or that culture. In the field of sports, on the other hand, it is occasionally deployed as a weapon to belittle Asian opponents—a blatant racist move and a departure from sportsmanship.</p> <p> The special preference for "slanted eyes"—whether as a peculiar taste or as a racism-driven weapon—is just an embodiment of Orientalism, which Edward Saïd, an American academic, defines as "a Western style of dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient." Slanted eyes, or foxy eyes—it isn't the way most Chinese people actually look like. It isn't what most Chinese think beauty is. IT IS what the West thinks a Chinese person should look like, or where his or her uniqueness lies.</p> <p> On Jan. 3, the BBC published an article examining the heated debate surrounding the slanted eyes controversy. Good for them that they acknowledged that "slanted eyes" have their racist roots. But at the same time they biasedly (what a surprise) mixed up "slanted eyes" with "small, narrow, and thin" eyes, and claimed that the episode mirrored the Chinese society's "rejection of aesthetic pluralism". It's poles apart between "slanted eyes"—which is the product of makeup or the racist gestures—and "small, narrow, or thin" eyes, which some people are born with naturally and shouldn't be ashamed of. Besides, of the billions of different appearances, it is unreasonable to always highlight an outdated and stereotypical flaw—that's not a showcase of "aesthetic pluralism" but a reinforcement of Orientalism and aesthetic hegemony.</p> <p> Aesthetics evolve, but stereotypes remain—this should become the real focus of the discussion. Asians are good at math. Chinese have foxy eyes. Indians have a heavy accent… We are marching forward in the second decade of the 21st century with marvelous scientific advancements and continually shifting aesthetic tastes, shouldn't we also then just leave these stinky and decayed stereotypes behind?&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

(People’s Daily Online/ He Luqi)</em></p> <p> The year 2021 is of milestone and historic significance for China. It witnessed the holding of the grand gathering celebrating the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), where CPC general secretary Xi Jinping solemnly announced the completion of the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.</p> <p> His firm statement, summarizing past experience and aiming to make new progress, demonstrated the responsibility of the CPC to seek happiness for the people, rejuvenation for the nation, progress for humanity, and harmony for the world.</p> <p> In the past year, the world experienced a persistent and unchecked pandemic and accelerating changes unseen in a century. These have once again put the world in another crossroads of history.</p> <p> Whether should we act out of the common good of humanity to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, advocate openness and win-win results, and promote equality and respect, or revert to a Cold War mentality, provoke division and antagonism, and stoke confrontation between blocs? The trial of strength between these two trends has a profound impact on the future of mankind.</p> <p> One’s competence is shown in trials and tribulations. Over the past year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping at its core, major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, focusing on the main tasks of serving national rejuvenation and promoting human progress, has drawn wisdom from the hundred-year history of the CPC, and proceeded from an insightful grasp of the general trend of human development, the grand scheme of things amid global changes, and the entire course of Chinese history.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0105/FOREIGN202201050900000290442618898.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 675px;" /></p> <p> <em>China-made vehicles are being loaded onto an oceangoing roll-on-roll-off ship for exportation, Jan. 3, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Wang Chun)</em></p> <p> Upholding the banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind, China has broken new ground in its diplomatic endeavors amid profound global changes and turned crises into opportunities amid complex situations on the international stage. The country has steadfastly forged ahead through struggle as well as cooperation.</p> <p> “China has embarked on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. As China enters a new development stage, we will follow a new development philosophy and foster a new development paradigm. We will build a new system of open economy of higher standards, create a more attractive business environment, and advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. We hope to work with countries in the Asia-Pacific and beyond to achieve higher-standard mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.”</p> <p> “The CPC has a grand and simple goal, which is essentially about delivering a better life to all Chinese people.”</p> <p> “The Chinese people's aspiration for a better life is the biggest internal driver for China's development and an inevitable trend of history, and any attempt to stop this trend will be rejected by the Chinese people and will by no means succeed.”</p> <p> These stories and philosophy of the CPC and China told by Xi, also the President of China, demonstrated to the world that no matter what changes are taking place on the international stage, China will continue to place its own development in the coordinate system of human development, seeing that the interests of the Chinese people are integrated with the common interests of the peoples of other countries, and the Chinese dream connected with the dreams of the people in the rest of the world, so as to bring new hopes and opportunities to the world and make newer and greater contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. At the same time, China will also make unswerving efforts to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests.</p> <p> On the new journey, China will follow a path of peaceful development. For any country or nation to achieve rejuvenation, it must follow the logic of history and the trend of the times in their pursuit of progress and development. China will stay committed to peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit and follow an independent foreign policy of peace, so as to achieve development by upholding world peace and promote world peace through its own development.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0105/FOREIGN202201050900000415450960320.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 642px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo shows a night view of the Xiangyang ancient town, central China’s Hubei province, Jan. 2, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Yang Dong)</em></p> <p> China’s commitment to peace doesn’t mean that China is a weak country subject to the bullying by others. The Chinese are a people who uphold justice and are not intimidated by threats of force. As a nation, they have a strong sense of pride and confidence. They have never bullied, oppressed, or subjugated the people of any other country, and they never will. By the same token, they will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or subjugate them.</p> <p> On the new journey, China will follow a path of reform and opening up. Just as President Xi promised at the fourth China International Import Expo, China will not change its resolve to open wider at a high standard; it will not change its determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world; and it will not change its commitment to an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all.</p> <p> To expand opening up doesn’t necessarily mean that China will lose itself. Throughout human history, no nation or country has ever become strong and prosperous by relying on external forces, indiscriminately copying the models of other countries, or blindly following in others’ footsteps. China learns whatever lessons it can learn from the achievements of other cultures, and adheres to independent development, stressing reliance on its own efforts to drive the nation’s development, and maintaining that China’s affairs must be decided and run by the Chinese people themselves.</p> <p> On the new journey, China will follow a path of multilateralism. There is only one Earth and one shared future for humanity. As we cope with the current crisis and endeavor to make a better day for everyone, we need to stand united and work together.</p> <p> China will firmly keep practicing real multilateralism, and safeguard the international system with the UN as the core, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms governing international relations embodied in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.</p> <p> It will also work with other countries under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to explore new ideas and new models of cooperation and keep enriching the practice of multilateralism under new circumstances.</p> <p> To safeguard multilateralism, one must firmly oppose unilateralism. China will keep working with other countries to oppose unilateral practices under the disguise of multilateralism, and oppose hegemonism and power politics, so as to safeguard international justice and equity.</p> <p> China always stands on the right side of history, advances with human progress, speaks for international equity and justice, and supports the vast developing countries. On the new journey in the new era, China will write a new chapter of win-win cooperation together with all the peace-loving countries and peoples.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> There is no escape from the long arm of the law. On Dec. 29, the Hong Kong Police Force arrested senior staff members of Stand News, an online news platform based in Hong Kong, for conspiracy to publish seditious publications, while the Security Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government froze relevant assets of the platform according to the law.</p> <p> However, the necessary actions of justice taken by the Hong Kong Police Force against Stand News, which were aimed at safeguarding national security and Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, have been maliciously discredited by some politicians in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Britain, as well as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).</p> <p> Ignoring right and wrong, these people have willfully misrepresented the lawful actions taken by the Hong Kong Police Force, vainly attempting to use press freedom as a shield for criminal acts and hamper the rule of law in Hong Kong through the straw-man trick.</p> <p> China strongly deplores and firmly opposes such acts of brazen interference in China’s internal affairs.</p> <p> Hong Kong is a society under the rule of law where it enforces laws and regulations and prosecutes any illegal acts.</p> <p> The Crimes Ordinance in Hong Kong clearly stipulates that any person who without lawful excuse has in his possession any seditious publication shall be guilty of an offense. Stand News, though in the guise of media outlet, is by nature a political organization.</p> <p> It fueled violent activities of the black-clad rioters and instigated acts of undermining the rule of law in Hong Kong during the social turbulence over the extradition bill.</p> <p> After the national security law in Hong Kong came into force, the organization still obstinately opposed China and created chaos in Hong Kong and constantly published articles inciting people to use violence and even split the country. Relevant activities of the organization constitute gross violations of the law.</p> <p> As a Chinese saying goes, “He who is unjust is doomed to destruction.” By arresting individuals suspected of conspiring to publish seditious publications and freezing relevant assets according to the law, the Hong Kong government has safeguarded national security of China, the rule of law and public order in Hong Kong. Relevant lawful actions have gained firm support from various sectors of the Hong Kong society.</p> <p> Distorting facts and discrediting the law enforcement actions taken by the Hong Kong Police Force under the guise of upholding press freedom, certain politicians in some Western countries, including the U.S., have already exposed their true intentions of disturbing the stability and order in Hong Kong.</p> <p> According to reports, at least 117 reporters were arrested or detained in the U.S. in 2020, a surge of 12 times from 2019.</p> <p> While touting the so-called “free and independent media”, using press freedom as a political tool to get their way, and wantonly smearing and attacking other countries in the name of press freedom, these politicians have turned a blind eye to the worsening press freedom situation in their own countries, which represents typical hegemonic acts and double standards.</p> <p> By trying to use press freedom to help anti-China rioters in Hong Kong escape legal punishment and seek extra-legal privileges for them, certain Western politicians vainly attempt to make sure anti-China forces continue to disrupt Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Such evil political manipulation is doomed to failure.</p> <p> It’s universal truth that freedom has its limits and anyone who violates the law must be punished. No country or region in the world allows news and speech to go unregulated by law. Anyone who engages in activities endangering national security and undermining the rule of law and social order under the guise of journalism will be punished according to the law.</p> <p> The Basic Law of the HKSAR and the national security law in the region protect rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents in accordance with the law, including freedom of speech and press.</p> <p> Anyone without prejudice cannot deny the fact that since the national security law took effect, the development of Hong Kong has returned to the right track and press freedom has enjoyed stronger guarantee in a safe, stable, and law-based environment.</p> <p> As of April this year, 628 foreign employees working for overseas media held work visas in Hong Kong, 98, or 18.5 percent more than that of the same period last year. Many media outlets in the U.S. and Britain have sent more foreign staff to Hong Kong. These facts serve as convincing evidence that press freedom is fully guaranteed in Hong Kong.</p> <p> Facts brook no distortion, and the prevailing trend of the times is irresistible. The irresponsible remarks made by Western politicians about press freedom in Hong Kong will never change the objective reality of Hong Kong’s flourishing media industry and freedom of the press, obstruct Hong Kong’s transition from chaos to stability and prosperity on its new historical journey, or China’s determined steps toward the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.</p> <p> External forces that attempt to stir up trouble for Hong Kong by confounding black and white and defaming the rule of law in the region had better immediately stop disrupting the HKSAR government’s exercising law-based governance on the pretext of press freedom and stop meddling in China’s internal affairs, including Hong Kong affairs.</p> <p> <em>(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

It has contributed a new model to the international political spectrum.</p> <p> In promoting democracy, China has undergone a difficult process of selection, experimentation, practice and development. Whole-process people's democracy contributes China's ideas and solutions to the political progress of humanity.</p> <p> A sound and genuine democracy must allow the people to become masters of the country. It must allow them to enjoy the right to stand for election, the right to vote, and the right to extensive participation. It must allow them the right to express their expectations and the right to have those expectations.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2021/1229/FOREIGN202112290903000356279704418.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 614px;" /></p> <p> <em>Villagers elect deputies to the National People’s Congress of Dayang township and Luyang district at a polling station in Dayang village, Dayang township, Luyang district, Hefei, east China’s Anhui province, Nov. 30, 2021.

Similarly, China did not duplicate Western models of democracy, but created its own. Now, the entire Chinese population, almost one fifth of the world's total, enjoys extensive rights and freedoms. This is most encouraging to developing countries and greatly enhances their confidence in developing their own democracy. China's new approach to democracy represents a significant contribution to international politics and human progress.</p> <p> Whole-process people's democracy offers Chinese experiences for other countries to develop the most suitable form of democracy in accordance with their own characteristics and realities. China’s democratic practices indicate that only democracy rooted in a country's unique social environment has proven to be reliable and effective, and can thrive and progress.</p> <p> Countries can borrow from the successful experience of others and develop forms of democracy suited to their own modernization process, but they should not simply duplicate other systems or models.</p> <p> China never seeks to export the Chinese model of democracy. On the contrary, it firmly supports the independent choice by every country of its own path to democracy, and opposes any interference in others' internal affairs on the pretext of "bringing democracy".</p> <p> Democracy manifests itself in two dimensions: On a national level, it refers to the people's status as masters of their own country; on an international level, it refers to the democratic relations between nations.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2021/1229/FOREIGN202112290903000485161527493.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 594px;" /></p> <p> <em>Deputies to the National People’s Congress solicit opinions from residents in Jinjiang community, Hepinglu neighborhood, Runzhou district, Zhenjiang, east China’s Jiangsu province, Nov. 12, 2021.

(People’s Daily Online/Yang Meiqing)</em></p> <p> In China’s practice of democracy, the country lays emphasis on both the role of electoral democracy and the advantages of consultative democracy, ensuring that people exercise their right to vote in elections and participate in state and social affairs through extensive consultations.</p> <p> Integrating electoral democracy and consultative democracy, the whole-process people’s democracy in China consolidates the people’s principal position in the country’s political and social life and leaves no room for politicians to shower promises while campaigning and break them all once elected.</p> <p> Whether the people enjoy democratic rights depends on whether they have the rights to take part in democratic elections, decision-making, management, and oversight.</p> <p> By exercising their right to vote in elections, the Chinese people elect those who represent their will to hold and exercise power. At the same time, they undertake extensive deliberations before major decisions are made.</p> <p> In China, hearing people’s voices, acting on their needs, and pooling their ideas and strength have become a standard practice. More and more ideas and suggestions of the general public are flowing directly to decision-makers at all levels, and they are increasingly reflected in the major decisions of the Party and the government.</p> <p> The Chinese people are the masters of the country and exercise their democratic rights accordingly, managing affairs of the state, the economy, culture, and society through various channels and in many forms.</p> <p> Taking into consideration its own conditions, China has explored a coordinated system of oversight and established a well-defined, efficient supervisory network with clear functions and responsibilities. Supervision of power extends across every area and into every corner.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2021/1229/FOREIGN202112290859000105275468826.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Residents in Qianxibian village, Tangya township, Jindong district, Jinhua city, east China’s Zhejiang province, cast their ballots to elect officials for the villagers’ committee, Nov. 26, 2020.
