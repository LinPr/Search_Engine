	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- In the face of COVID-19 flare-ups and increasing downward pressure on the economy, the Chinese leadership is looking at infrastructure investment to bolster growth while realizing the country's modernization goals.</p> <p> The country's renewed calls for infrastructure investment were reiterated at recent high-profile meetings chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission.</p> <p> During the meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs on April 26, Xi, also head of the committee, urged all-out efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction in the country's endeavor toward a modern infrastructure system.</p> <p> From traditional infrastructures, such as water conservancy and transportation networks, to the new infrastructures led by cloud computing and artificial intelligence platforms, the meeting discussed a wide range of infrastructure development topics and gave full consideration to the various needs related to China's future development.</p> <p> Later that week, on April 29, a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, chaired by Xi, reiterated the need to comprehensively reinforce infrastructure construction.</p> <p> These high-level announcements made during the two consecutive meetings highlighted the pivotal role of infrastructure in the national economy, said Sun Chuanwang, a professor at Xiamen University.</p> <p> The moves will further stimulate investment potential in the infrastructure sector and bring opportunities for the relevant industries and enterprises, Sun added.</p> <p> A flurry of pledges to ensure solid implementation followed. The Ministry of Transport, for instance, planned to advance infrastructure investment with a moderately proactive approach. Meanwhile, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) urged to expand infrastructure investment in the fields of industrial upgrades, urban and rural construction and national security.</p> <p> Infrastructure serves as a pillar for economic and social development. Under Xi's leadership, China has made great advances in infrastructure construction, ranging from water conservancy and transportation projects, to information infrastructure, with the overall level improving in leaps and bounds.</p> <p> Concerned about people's well-being in border areas, Xi urged efforts to advance the construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway project with high quality, in an instruction made ahead of the construction of the Ya'an-Nyingchi section of the railway in November 2020.</p> <p> Describing the project as a vital step in facilitating the Party's general plan for governing Tibet in the new era, he stressed the project's important role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.</p> <p> A few months later, aboard a train from Nyingchi Railway Station to the regional capital Lhasa, Xi inspected the construction along the railway and hailed the railway as a major move to boost Tibet's development and improve people's living standards.</p> <p> With the country's modernization drive high on his agenda, Xi met with the main scientists and project leaders of China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, during his inspection trip in southwest China's Guizhou Province in February last year.</p> <p> Noting that the FAST is a major national scientific and technological infrastructure, Xi stressed the importance of science and technology in China's pursuit of building a modern socialist country.</p> <p> In addition to leveraging infrastructure investment to spur economic growth in the short term, China has also been striving to build technological and digital infrastructure as a part of its long-term goal to optimize the overall economic layout.</p> <p> As part of the digital information infrastructure, the number of 5G base stations in the country increased by 81,000 during the first quarter of the year, bringing the total to over 1.5 million.</p> <p> In the country's latest steps to ride the digitalization wave amid a surge of demand for computing capacity, China initiated works earlier this year on a mega project to establish eight national computing hubs and 10 national data center clusters in a bid to improve overall computing power and resource efficiency.</p> <p> "Computing power has already become an important infrastructure for the national economic development," the NDRC stated on its website, estimating China's demand for computing power to surge by over 20 percent annually in the coming years.</p> <p> As the Chinese economy enters into its critical stage of transformation and upgrading, a modern infrastructure system with a focus on shoring up weak links and fostering new growth drivers will lay a solid foundation for the country's medium and long-term development, said Fan Ruoying, a researcher with the Bank of China.</p> <p> Looking ahead, efforts should be made to improve cross-regional and cross-department coordination in organizing infrastructure investment, lift restrictions on market access for private enterprises, and further innovate investment and financing methods, Fan noted.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- "Everything in life must be experienced by oneself; it is the minor steps that take one to a wider world." President Xi Jinping quoted this line from an ancient Chinese poem to encourage young Chinese to strive for progress.</p> <p> The poem was written by Fan Peng, a Chinese poet in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, cited the line while addressing a ceremony held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) on Tuesday.</p> <p> Speaking at the ceremony on Tuesday, Xi called on CYLC members to be models of hard work and dedication, take the lead in remaining committed to standing on the side of the people, and be realistic, pragmatic, and down-to-earth.</p> <p> Realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a relay race of history in which today's young people should strive for excellent performance, said Xi, adding that the times have always endowed young people with historical responsibilities.</p> <p> "We believe a nation will be strong only when its young people are strong and a nation will make progress only when its younger generations make progress," said Xi. "We have always believed that the future of our nation rests on youths."</p> <p> The CYLC was founded on May 5, 1922, under the direct leadership of the CPC.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Liu Jiayi, a young nurse in China, came under the global spotlight when President Xi Jinping praised her on an international platform.</p> <p> Xi shared her story during a speech at a meeting of the United Nations (UN) in 2020, expressing his admiration for medical workers, including nurses.</p> <p> Liu was among the 40,000-plus health workers from across the country who rushed to the central province of Hubei in 2020 when it was fighting a fierce battle against the COVID-19 epidemic.</p> <p> "The moment I put on the protective suit, I am not a kid anymore." -- Xi cited Liu's words from a TV interview when she was told by a journalist that she is still very young, and needs to be taken care of.</p> <p> "Those words moved the whole nation," Xi said while sharing Liu's story at the meeting marking the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.</p> <p> Coming from the city of Huizhou, Guangdong Province, about 1,000 km south of Hubei's capital Wuhan, Liu was the youngest member of the medical-assistance team dispatched by the province to assist with Wuhan's fight against the novel coronavirus.</p> <p> She volunteered to join the team during the Lantern Festival in February 2020. It was the furthest distance she had ever traveled from home, and the month she spent there was the longest time she had ever been away from her parents.</p> <p> At the UN meeting, Xi spoke highly of Liu and medical workers like her, saying "their courage and hard work have shown the very best of the medical profession" and "their devotion and sacrifice have kept the nation intact through difficult times."</p> <p> At a time when multiple Chinese cities are battling a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, a large number of nurses again threw themselves into the battle without hesitation.</p> <p> "They proved worthy of the great trust placed in them," as Xi rightly said in his greetings to nurses in 2020 ahead of International Nurses Day, which falls on May 12.</p> <p> The number of registered nurses in China had reached 5.02 million at the end of 2021, and there were about 3.56 nurses for every 1,000 people, according to official statistics.</p> <p> Xi hailed them for exemplifying the noble spirit of respecting and protecting life, healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, and being dedicated to the cause, and asked governments at all levels to care about nurses, focus more efforts on strengthening the nursing workforce, and improve the incentive mechanisms.</p> <p> Nursing is an important part of health care, Xi noted, calling on all members of society to show their appreciation and support for nurses.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> HONG KONG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday firmly rejected the irresponsible comments from some U.S. and Western institutions and politicians that smeared the Hong Kong police's legitimate law enforcement actions towards those suspected of endangering national security.</p> <p> "Rights and freedoms" are not shields for illegal activities in Hong Kong, and the office urged external forces to immediately stop the botched political performances rife with ideological prejudices, said a spokesperson for the office.</p> <p> Hong Kong is administered by the rule of law where laws must be observed and lawbreakers held accountable, and no one shall be above the law, the spokesperson said.</p> <p> "It is a globally accepted principle that those who violate laws shall be held to justice regardless of their background or identity," the spokesperson said.</p> <p> The Hong Kong police, in accordance with their statutory functions and powers and legal procedures, investigated and arrested those suspected of engaging in activities that endanger national security, which are legitimate and necessary actions to safeguard national security as well as the rule of law and justice in the HKSAR, and brook no interference, the spokesperson said.</p> <p> The spokesperson pointed out that since the implementation of the national security law in the HKSAR, China's security has been better protected, the Hong Kong society has been more stable, and the public has enjoyed a stronger sense of security.</p> <p> For a long time, some outside actors, under the pretext of "democracy", "the rule of law", "human rights" and "freedom", have grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs and played the "Hong Kong card" to curb China's development, according to the spokesperson.</p> <p> People around the world have seen through their tricks and hypocrisy, the spokesperson said, adding that hysteria of the external forces has further exposed their anger and anxiety when they saw the "political agents" they supported faced legal consequences.</p> <p> The spokesperson stressed that those who take a wrong path have no future.</p> <p> "Vilification of external forces cannot stop the historical trend of Hong Kong's transition from chaos to stability and prosperity, cannot change the bright prospects of Hong Kong's development, and cannot prevent China from achieving great national rejuvenation," the spokesperson said.</p> <p> The office urged relevant countries and politicians to follow the historical trend, stop slandering the national security law and law enforcement actions of the HKSAR, refrain from interfering in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs, and no longer go down the path leading nowhere.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony marking the centenary of the Communist Youth League of China (the League) was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday morning. President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered an important speech.</p> <p> He stressed that youth gives rise to infinite hope and young people are the creators of a bright future. For the younger generations in the new era, the time could not be better for them to complete weighty tasks since they have an incomparably broad stage to display their talents and brighter prospects than ever before to realize their dreams. Realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a relay race of history in which today's young people should strive to deliver their best performance.</p> <p> President Xi called on the League to focus on the fundamental task of preparing the youth to contribute to and carry forward the socialist cause. The League should nourish the youth for the Party, take on its responsibilities, bear in mind the interests of the youth, and have the courage to reform itself.</p> <p> He hopes that the League will unite and help its members and young people grow into new-era exemplary youths who have ideals, dare to assume responsibility, and are hardworking and able to endure hardship, so that they will build up the momentum for national rejuvenation with their youthful energy and creativity and build a better China with their youthful ingenuity and effort.</p> <p> Other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also attended the event. They are Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng.</p> <p> The atmosphere was solemn and warm in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People. A streamer bearing the words "Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Youth League of China" hung above the podium. In the middle of the curtain behind was the emblem of the Communist Youth League of China, with a sign reading "1922-2022" below and five red flags on each side.</p> <p> The ceremony began at 10:00 a.m. All rose and sang the national anthem.</p> <p> After enthusiastic applause, Xi Jinping delivered a speech.</p> <p> He started by extending warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all League members as well as Communist Youth League organizations and staff at all levels on behalf of the CPC Central Committee.</p> <p> Since the day of its founding, the Party has paid particular attention to the youth and placed the hopes of China's revolution on them, Xi noted.</p> <p> Over the past century, under the Party's strong leadership, the League has stayed true to its original aspiration and founding mission, organized and guided generation after generation of young people to stay firm in their convictions and loyal to the Party, fight for national independence and the people's liberation, and contribute to the country's strength and prosperity and the happiness of the people. Through these efforts, a stirring chapter of youth was written on China's path toward national rejuvenation.</p> <p> Over the past century, the Communist Youth League has been of one heart and mind with the Party and followed in its footsteps, he said. It has united and led League members and young people in dedicating themselves to the cause of the Party and the people, devoting their youth to the journey toward national rejuvenation, and thus engraving their glory in the annals of history. Both history and reality tell us that the Communist Youth League of China is worthy of being regarded as the vanguard of the Chinese youth movement, a loyal aide to the Party, and a reliable reserve force.</p> <p> Over the past century, with firm ideals and strong will, the Communist Youth League has amassed valuable experience, Xi stressed. The 100-year history of the League has defined that upholding Party leadership is crucial to its success, and instilled its political essence of having firm ideals and convictions. The century-long history has also helped build up the League's strength for contributing to national rejuvenation, and identified taking root among young people as its source of vitality. Such important experience should be drawn upon to make new achievements in the future.</p> <p> Xi pointed out that on the new journey ahead, how to better unite, organize, and mobilize young people in China's efforts to achieve the Second Centenary Goal and realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a major topic that needs to be addressed in the Chinese youth movement and work related to youths in the new era.</p> <p> He shared his hopes for the League in four aspects.</p> <p> First, he hopes that the League would nourish the youth for the Party and remain a political school that leads the political advancement of the Chinese youth. The League should be politically-minded, start with ways of thinking, and take into consideration the characteristics of the youth in helping them set lofty goals at an early age, and in fostering their trust for the Party, confidence in socialism with Chinese characteristics and belief in Marxism from the bottom of their heart. The League should be guided by the vitally important goal of making sure that the cause of the Party is carried forward by future generations, and focus on the fundamental task of preparing the youth to contribute to and carry forward the socialist cause. It should help the youth become more proud, confident, and assured in their identity as Chinese people through tempering both in thinking and practice.</p> <p> Second, he hopes the League would take up its responsibilities and remain a vanguard in organizing the Chinese youth to keep going forward. The League should unite and lead its members and young people in heeding the call of the Party and the people, bearing in mind the country's most fundamental interests, shouldering their missions, and realizing their aspirations and making achievements in new fronts in the new era. The League should encourage its members and young people to pursue the great ideal and drive forward the great cause.</p> <p> Third, he hopes the League would bear in mind the interests of the youth and remain the strongest bond between the Party and the youth. The League should uphold the lifeline of serving the youth, carry out its political duty of consolidating and expanding the support from the youth for the Party's governance, and make every effort to benefit the youth, solve their difficulties, think from their perspective, respond to their concerns, and offer the youth tangible support.</p> <p> Fourth, he hopes the League should have the courage to reform itself and remain an advanced organization that closely follows the Party and stays at the forefront of the times. The League should ensure the overall leadership of the Party throughout the whole process of its work in all areas, follow the Chinese socialist development path of people's organizations, and deepen its reform. The League should develop a keen understanding of the youth and, in light of the new changes and features of young people's work and life styles, explore new approaches and models for its primary-level organizations, lead youth and student federations in promoting patriotism and socialism and constantly consolidate and expand the patriotic united front among the youth. The League should also use the Party's experience and effective practices in strict Party self-governance to improve itself with the spirit of reform and innovation and in a strict and practical manner, and at the same time exercise rigorous self-governance. Through comprehensive and high-standard self-improvement, the Communist Youth League will take on a positive image that reflects the spirit of the times.</p> <p> Striving for progress is the most precious character of youths, and it is also what is most expected of them by the Party and the people, Xi stressed.</p> <p> League members in the new era should be role models of upholding lofty ideals and firm beliefs, take the lead in studying Marxist theory, build the ideal of communism and a shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, conscientiously practice core socialist values, and fully promote patriotism, he said.</p> <p> They are expected to play an exemplary role by studying hard and boldly engaging in innovation, take the requirements of their jobs as the starting point to improve their capabilities and strive for excellence, and try their best to become backbone personnel and advanced youths.</p> <p> They should be both brave and adept in carrying out our struggle, lead the way in rising to challenges and tackling tough problems, and refuse to be taken in by fallacies or to tremble in the face of danger.</p> <p> They should be models of hard work and dedication, take the lead in remaining committed to standing on the side of the people, be realistic, pragmatic, and down-to-earth, be the first to suffer hardship and the last to enjoy comfort, and be willing to play a minor but forever effective role in their posts.</p> <p> They should set an example in acting in a good and virtuous manner and in observing a strict code of discipline, uphold public and personal morals, abide by disciplinary regulations and the law, and strictly fulfill their obligations as League members.</p> <p> All League members should receive political training, intensify political tempering, and strive for political advancement. On this basis, they should actively draw closer to the Party, set it as their goal to become a qualified Party member, and take pride in achieving it.</p> <p> League staff must refine their political character of being loyal to the Party and champion the spirit of pursuing noble ideals, Xi said.</p> <p> They must consciously practice the mass line and firmly establish a correct mass viewpoint, maintain close ties with youths, be friends instead of "bureaucrats" to youths, and work to better benefit youths rather than themselves.</p> <p> They must develop a work style of being responsible and practical, refrain from empty talk to do more pragmatic work, have the courage to bear hardships, take on difficult tasks, shoulder heavy responsibilities, and face risks under harsh environments and at the community level, and conduct themselves properly and do solid work.</p> <p> They must improve moral cultivation to remain honest and self-disciplined, hold regulations and the law in awe and speak and act prudently, constantly build up their willpower, perseverance, and self-control, and be persons who always bear the public good in mind, have a strong sense of righteousness, and remain untainted by malpractices.</p> <p> On the quest to realize national rejuvenation, the Communist Party of China is the vanguard, the Communist Youth League is the spearhead, and the Young Pioneers is the reserve force, Xi said, adding that joining the Pioneers, the League, and then the Party makes up the "trilogy of life" for youths seeking political advancement.</p> <p> The League should perform its political duty of guiding the Young Pioneers, standardize and strengthen mechanisms for the Young Pioneers recommending outstanding members to the Youth League and from the Youth League to the Party, and work hard to improve the interconnection and coordination between personnel cultivation in the Young Pioneers, the Youth League, and the Party.</p> <p> Party organizations at all levels must attach great importance to the training and recruitment of outstanding young people and should, particularly, focus on cultivating and admitting outstanding Youth League members into the Party, so as to ensure our socialist country never changes its nature.</p> <p> Party committees and Party leadership groups at all levels must study the laws governing youths' growth and their contemporary features with great enthusiasm, devote great energy to the work related to youths, and serve wholeheartedly as their confidant and their guide, Xi noted.</p> <p> Party organizations at all levels must implement the systems and mechanisms for using Party building to lead League building, study and resolve major issues regarding League work on a regular basis, care about and expect more of League staff, and support the League in creatively carrying out their initiatives in accordance with the features of and the laws governing the work on people's organizations.</p> <p> For the Party and the country, young people deserve the best protection and bear our highest expectations, Xi stressed.</p> <p> "They are like the young trees thriving on earth that will eventually grow into towering trees to provide shelter for those in need.

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of a speech delivered by Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, at a ceremony marking the centenary of the Communist Youth League of China on Tuesday.</p> <p> Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Youth League of China</p> <p> May 10, 2022</p> <p> Xi Jinping</p> <p> Members of the Communist Youth League of China (League), young friends, and comrades,</p> <p> Youth gives rise to infinite hope, and young people are the creators of a bright future. A nation can thrive and prosper only when it places hopes on its youth and maintains its youthful vigor.</p> <p> Today, we are gathered here at the ceremony marking the centenary of the Communist Youth League of China to encourage League members and young people to forge ahead on the new journey toward realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.</p> <p> First of all, on behalf of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, I would like to extend warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all League members as well as Communist Youth League organizations and staff at all levels.</p> <p> League members, young friends, and comrades,</p> <p> The Chinese nation is an ancient nation with a long, enduring history and has experienced many years of vicissitudes. More importantly, it is also a youthful nation that continuously pursues self-improvement and remains vibrant. With a civilization of over 5,000 years, our nation has long cherished the traditional belief that heroes are cultivated from young age and embraces the idea that the waves behind drive on those ahead. We believe a nation will be strong only when its young people are strong and a nation will make progress only when its younger generations make progress. We have always believed that the future of our nation rest on youths. For hundreds of years, the strength, vitality, and creativity of the youth have always been a mighty force that drives our nation forward against all challenges and enables it to stand tall among the nations of the world.</p> <p> The destiny of the youth is always closely connected with the times. After the Opium War of 1840, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and suffered greater ravages than ever before. The country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese civilization was plunged into darkness. Many noble-minded patriots sought to pull the nation together. Many progressive young people were enlightened at this "Awakening Age." The great May Fourth Movement promoted the spread of Marxism in China, ushered in the new-democratic revolution, and marked the beginning of the youth's role as the pioneers advancing social changes in China.</p> <p> With the youth awakened and advanced ideas disseminated, the dynamic revolution quickly swept across the vast land of China. As Marxism-Leninism was becoming closely integrated with the Chinese workers' movement, the Communist Party of China was born. Since the day of its founding, the Party has paid particular attention to the youth and placed the hopes of revolution on them. At its First National Congress, the Party carried out specific studies into the establishment and development of a youth league as the prep school for the Party. On May 5, 1922, the Communist Youth League of China was founded under the direct care and leadership of the CPC, marking a milestone in the history of China's revolution and youth movement.</p> <p> Faithfully following the Party and working for the Party and the people constitute the Communist Youth League's original aspiration and founding mission, to which the League has stayed true over the past century. Under the Party's strong leadership, it has organized and guided generation after generation of young people to stay firm in their convictions and loyal to the Party, fight for national independence and the people's liberation, and contribute to the country's strength and prosperity and the happiness of the people. Through these efforts, a stirring chapter of youth was written on our path toward China's national rejuvenation.</p> <p> In the period of the new-democratic revolution, the Communist Youth League actively engaged in promoting Marxism in China, enlightening young people with advanced ideas and rallying their force. Under the League's leadership, its members and young people devoted themselves to anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements of workers, peasants, and students, actively served in revolutionary armies led by the Party, and fought in the battles to bring down warlords, resist Japanese invaders, and overthrow the rule of the Kuomintang. They manifested a spirit of fighting bravely without fear of sacrifice. Charging forward through hailstorms of bullets, League members and young people showed their firm faith and passed the test of life and death, dedicating their youth to the victory of China's revolution and making outstanding contributions.</p> <p> In the period of socialist revolution and construction, the Communist Youth League took an active part in the most extensive and profound social reform in the Chinese history. Its members acted as the spearhead in various campaigns and they were organized to reclaim uncultivated land, educate the illiterate, and learn from the model soldier Lei Feng. Under the League's leadership, its members and young people were empowered by the spirit of "daring to make the sun and the moon shine in the new sky" and shouted out the slogan of "devoting our youth to the motherland." They rose to all sorts of challenges, no matter in scientific researches or the harsh natural environment. They manifested a spirit of daring to struggle and working hard. Pulling through hardships and dangers, League members and young people took the initiative to shoulder responsibilities and braved themselves in the most challenging and demanding missions, dedicating their youth to the country's construction and making outstanding contributions.</p> <p> In the new period of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, the Communist Youth League adjusted itself to the strategic shift in the focus of the Party and the country's work, freed the mind, and forged ahead with resolve. It launched a large number of creative initiatives, encouraging young people to be "pacesetters of the New Long March," to uphold "five things to stress," "four things to beautify," and "three things to love," to join the Project Hope for children's education in rural areas, to serve as volunteers, to perfect their professional performances, and to work for the environmental project "Mother River Protection." Under the League's leadership, a call of the time that "let us unite for national rejuvenation" resonated, and League members and young people rode the waves on all fronts of modernization. They manifested a spirit of daring to explore and setting the trend. Engaging themselves in the modernization drive by destroying the old and establishing the new, League members and young people acted as trailblazers of reform and led the way ahead, dedicating their youth to the country's reform and opening up and socialist modernization and making outstanding contributions.</p> <p> In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Communist Youth League has pursued a great struggle, a great project, a great cause, and a great dream, made innovation on the basis of what has worked in the past, advanced its work with full strength, and reformed itself comprehensively. Under the League's leadership, its members and young people did their best in the fight against poverty, in cutting-edge scientific researches, in disaster rescue and relief missions, on the epidemic response frontline, in the Olympic arena, and at posts of defending the motherland, stepping up and responding to the calls of the Party and the people when they were most needed. They have manifested a spirit of self-confidence, self-reliance, vigor, and action. "My pure love is only for China," a phrase written by a young soldier and martyr, has become the most powerful expression of young people in contemporary China. Bearing a great dream and a great mission, League members and young people have willingly carried the ball on the frontline and demonstrated their brilliance in the course of realizing national rejuvenation, dedicating their youth to historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country and making outstanding contributions.</p> <p> Although the times keep changing, young people in China have been committed to the same mission. Over the past century, the Communist Youth League has been of one heart and mind with the Party and followed in its footsteps. It has united and led League members and young people in dedicating themselves to the cause of the Party and the people, devoting their youth to the journey toward national rejuvenation, and thus engraving their glory in the annals of history.</p> <p> Both history and reality tell us that the Communist Youth League of China is worthy of being regarded as the vanguard of the Chinese youth movement, a loyal aide to the Party, and a reliable reserve force.</p> <p> League members, young friends, and comrades,</p> <p> The further we advance and the higher we climb, the better we should be at absorbing wisdom from our past experience, boosting our confidence, and improving our strength. Over the past century, with firm ideals and strong will, the Communist Youth League has amassed valuable experience which should be drawn upon to make new achievements in the future.</p> <p> The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has defined that upholding Party leadership is crucial to the League's success.</p> <p> The Communist Youth League would not have taken shape without the Communist Party of China. Since the very first day it was founded, the League has shared the same banner, will, and mission with the Party, integrated upholding the leadership of the Party into its lifeblood, and developed its particular character and distinct advantage which differentiate it from other youth organizations. Following the instructions and guidance of the Party remains the political career of the League, and that the League will act upon the Party's call is the political belief of League members from generation to generation. History has proved that only if it upholds Party leadership can the Communist Youth League unite the youth and lead them in moving forward and ensure that the Chinese youth movement is advancing in the right political direction.</p> <p> The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has instilled its political essence of having firm ideals and convictions.</p> <p> Inspired by ideals and convictions, the Communist Youth League has organized and united young people with firm belief and scientific thinking. The first national congress of the League defined building a communist society as its ultimate ideal and made clear its banner of socialism, which has lighted the beacon of ideals and convictions among generations of young people. This is the most fundamental and enduring cohesion of the League. History tells us that only by holding high the banner of communism and socialism, can the Communist Youth League form the most solid unity, forge the most effective organization, and ensure that the youth are united under the banner of the Party's ideals and convictions.</p> <p> The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has helped build up its strength for contributing to national rejuvenation.</p> <p> The Party's goal determines the orientation of the Communist Youth League's action. Focusing on the Party's key tasks in different stages of history, the League has united and led its members and youths in joining the people in practice. It has served as pioneers in efforts toward national rejuvenation and played their role as a fresh driving force and the spearhead, ensuring that the goal of achieving national rejuvenation become the main theme throughout the Chinese youth movement. History has fully demonstrated that only by centering on endeavoring for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, can the Communist Youth League unite as many young people as possible to write an epic chapter of youth.</p> <p> The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has identified taking root among young people as its source of vitality.</p> <p> The Communist Youth League is glowing with youth and vigor after a hundred years of vicissitudes because it has consistently taken root among young people, put its focus of work on the overwhelming majority of young workers and peasants and ordinary youths, and stood with the youth while building a bridge to bring young people closer to the Party. History has shown that only by drawing nourishment and strength from the fertile soil of the vast number of young people, can the Communist Youth League be a close friend to youths that is trustworthy, reliable, and inseparable.</p> <p> League members, young friends, and comrades,</p> <p> Under the strong leadership of the Party, people of all ethnic groups in China have united as one with a shared purpose, have fulfilled the First Centenary Goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and are moving on toward the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects.</p> <p> Realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a relay race of history in which today's young people should strive for excellent performance. The times have always endowed young people with historical responsibilities. For generations of youths in the new era, the time could not be better for them to complete weighty tasks since they have an incomparably broad stage to display their talents and brighter prospects than ever before to realize their dreams. At the ceremony marking the centenary of the Communist Party of China, representatives from the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers declared the commitment of making due contribution to building a strong country. This is what Chinese youths are supposed to do in the new era and what the Party's youth organizations must be committed to.</p> <p> On the new journey ahead, how to better unite, organize, and mobilize young people in China's efforts to achieve the Second Centenary Goal and realize the Chinese Dream is a major topic that needs to be addressed in the Chinese youth movement and work related to youths in the new era. The Communist Youth League must enhance its leadership, organization, and services, unite and help its members and young people grow into new-era exemplary youths who have ideals, dare to assume responsibility, and are hardworking and able to endure hardship. In this way, they will build up the momentum for national rejuvenation with their youthful energy and creativity and build a better China with their youthful ingenuity and effort.</p> <p> Here I would like to share a few of my hopes with the League.</p> <p> First, I hope the League would nourish the youth for the Party and remain a political school that leads the political advancement of the Chinese youth. Only those aim high would scale the heights and look afar, and only those with a global vision would achieve great success. The passion of youth should be accompanied by firm ideals and convictions. By including the word "communist" into the League's name, the Party hopes that this youth organization would always stand on the high ground of ideals and convictions, equip the youth with the Party's theories, inspire them with the Party's original aspiration and founding mission, guide them with the Party's glorious banner, and shape them with the Party's fine conduct. The youth of China in the new era are more confident and capable of self-improvement, and they think more critically. At the same time, they are facing the influence of various trends of thought and would inevitably get confused about matters such as ideals and reality, doctrines and issues, egoism and altruism, individual and collective identities, and the nation and the world. More meticulous education and guidance is needed to help them make social observations with a sharp eye, think about life with a sober mind, and create the future with wisdom.</p> <p> As a school for the young people to study socialism with Chinese characteristics and communism through practice, the Communist Youth League should be politically-minded, start with ways of thinking, and take into consideration the characteristics of the youth in helping them set lofty goals at an early age, and in fostering their trust for the Party, confidence in socialism with Chinese characteristics and belief in Marxism from the bottom of their hearts. The League should be guided by the vitally important goal of making sure that the cause of the Party is carried forward by future generations, and focus on the fundamental task of preparing the youth to contribute to and carry forward the socialist cause. It should help the youth become more proud, confident, and assured in their identity as Chinese people through tempering both in thinking and practice, so that the cause of the Party will be carried on from generation to generation.</p> <p> Second, I hope the League would take up its responsibilities and remain a vanguard in organizing the Chinese youth to keep going forward. Working hard is the brightest color of youth, and taking actions is the best trial for young people. Responsibilities and commitment are what make the youthful years shine. The youth are always pioneers who are most passionate about innovation and most motivated to innovate. The cause of the Party and the people would not be advanced without the endeavor and dedication of generations of young aspirants. Only when youth fully aligns with the cause of the Party and the people, can its spectrum be broadened and energy fully stimulated. Young people are the most vigorous, enterprising, and least conservative group in society, who possess infinite power to improve the objective world and promote social progress. The Communist Youth League should unite and lead its members and young people in catching the contemporary waves, heeding the call of the Party and the people, bearing in mind the country's most fundamental interests, shouldering their missions, and realizing their aspirations and making achievements in new fronts in the new era. The League should encourage its members and young people to pursue the great ideal, drive forward the great cause, and let their youth blossom in fields where the Party and the people need them most.</p> <p> Thirdly, I hope the League would bear in mind the interests of the youth and remain the strongest bond between the Party and the youth. The Communist Youth League is a people's organization under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, as well as the youth's own organization. The greatest strength of the League lies in its network at the primary level that allows the League to stay close to the youth. The League should uphold the lifeline of serving the youth and carry out its political duty of consolidating and expanding the support from the youth for the Party's governance. While letting the Party know about the wellbeing of the youth, the League should also fully pass on the Party's care to the youth. The League should make every effort to benefit the youth, solve their difficulties, think from their perspective, respond to their concerns, and make full use of the resources and channels provided by the Party to offer the youth tangible support. In this way, young people would genuinely feel that the Party is always close by and ready to attend to their needs.</p> <p> Fourthly, the League should have the courage to reform itself and remain an advanced organization that closely follows the Party and stays at the forefront of the times. For the Communist Youth League, what kind of youth organization it should develop itself into and how to build it are major questions of fundamental importance. "A fixed system is not capable of responding to infinite changes, one road would not lead to myriad destinations, and a lost sword would hardly be located in a river by leaving a mark on the boat." Only through bold self-reform can the League keep pace with the times, the youth's development, and the trend of practice and innovation.</p> <p> The Communist Youth League should ensure the overall leadership of the Party throughout the whole process of its work in all areas, follow the Chinese socialist development path of people's organizations, focus on the goal and direction of maintaining and strengthening its political character, pioneering nature, and connection with the people, and deepen its reform. The League should develop a keen understanding of the youth and, in light of the new changes and features of young people's work and life styles, explore new approaches and models for its primary-level organizations. It should lead youth and student federations in promoting patriotism and socialism and constantly consolidate and expand the patriotic united front among the youth. The League should also use the Party's experience and effective practices in strict Party self-governance to improve itself with the spirit of reform and innovation and in a strict and practical manner, and at the same time exercise rigorous self-governance. Through comprehensive and high-standard self-improvement, the Communist Youth League will take on a positive image that reflects the spirit of the times.</p> <p> As a line in an old Chinese poem goes, "Everything in life must be experienced by oneself; it is the minor steps that take one to a wider world." Striving for progress is the most precious character of the youth, and it is also what is most expected of them by our Party and people. League members in the new era should be role models of upholding lofty ideals and firm beliefs, take the lead in studying Marxist theory, build the ideal of communism and a shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, conscientiously practice core socialist values, and fully promote patriotism. They should play an exemplary role by studying hard and boldly engaging in innovation, take the requirements of their jobs as the starting point to improve their capabilities and strive for excellence, and try their best to become backbone personnel and advanced youths. They should be both brave and adept in carrying out our struggle, lead the way in rising to challenges and tackling tough problems, and refuse to be taken in by fallacies or to tremble in the face of danger. They should be models of hard work and dedication, take the lead in remaining committed to standing on the side of the people, be realistic, pragmatic, and down-to-earth, be the first to suffer hardship and the last to enjoy comfort, and be willing to play a minor but forever effective role in their posts. They should set an example in acting in a good and virtuous manner and in observing a strict code of discipline, uphold public and personal morals, abide by disciplinary regulations and the law, and strictly fulfill their obligations as members of the Communist Youth League. All League members should receive political training, intensify political tempering, and strive for political advancement. On this basis, they should actively draw closer to the Party, set it as their goal to become a qualified Party member, and take pride in achieving it.</p> <p> For many years, the staff of the Communist Youth League have carried forward their fine traditions, diligently performed their duties, and thus made significant contributions to the Party's work related to youths. League staff must refine their political character of being loyal to the Party, champion the spirit of pursuing noble ideals, and remain clear-minded and strong-hearted so that they make people feel the lucidness and pureness of young officials at first sight. They must consciously practice the mass line and firmly establish a correct mass viewpoint, maintain close ties with youths, be friends instead of "bureaucrats" to youths, and work to better benefit youths rather than themselves. They must develop a work style of being responsible and practical, refrain from empty talk to do more pragmatic work, have the courage to bear hardships, take on difficult tasks, shoulder heavy responsibilities, and face risks under harsh environments and at the community level, and conduct themselves properly and do solid work. They must improve moral cultivation to remain honest and self-disciplined, hold regulations and the law in awe and speak and act prudently, constantly build up their willpower, perseverance, and self-control, and be persons who always bear the public good in mind, have a strong sense of righteousness, and remain untainted by malpractices.</p> <p> League members, young friends, and comrades,</p> <p> Revolutionaries are always young. Today, a hundred years on from its founding, the Communist Party of China is still in its prime, and remains as determined as ever to achieve lasting greatness for the Chinese nation. Quoting from Engels, Lenin once said, "We are the party of the future, and the future belongs to the youth. We are a party of innovators, and it is always the youth that most eagerly follows the innovators. We are a party that is waging a self-sacrificing struggle against the old rottenness, and youth is always the first to undertake a self-sacrificing struggle." Both history and reality have shown that the Communist Party of China is a party that always preserves its youthful features and a party that is worthy of the young people's trust and worth following.</p> <p> On the quest to realize national rejuvenation, the Communist Party of China is the vanguard, the Communist Youth League is the spearhead, and the Young Pioneers is the reserve force. Joining the Pioneers, the League, and then the Party makes up the "trilogy of life" for youths seeking political advancement. The Party has kept its gate open to all young people and will continue to welcome more youths who will add new blood to the Party. The Communist Youth League must perform its political duty of guiding the Young Pioneers, standardize and strengthen mechanisms for the Young Pioneers recommending outstanding members to the Youth League and from the League to the Party, and work hard to improve the interconnection and coordination between personnel cultivation in the Young Pioneers, the League, and the Party. Party organizations at all levels must attach great importance to the training and recruitment of outstanding young people and should, particularly, focus on cultivating and admitting outstanding League members into the Party, so as to ensure our socialist country never changes its nature.</p> <p> Li Dazhao, a Chinese communist, once said, "The youth are the soul of a country." The Party's work related to young people was, is, and will be of strategic importance. Party committees and Party leadership groups at all levels must study the laws governing youths' growth and their contemporary features with great enthusiasm, devote great energy to the work related to youths, and serve wholeheartedly as their confidant and their guide. Party organizations at all levels must implement the systems and mechanisms for using Party building to lead League building, study and resolve major issues regarding League work on a regular basis, care about and expect more of League staff, and support the League in creatively carrying out their initiatives in accordance with the features of and the laws governing the work on people's organizations.</p> <p> League members, young friends, and comrades,</p> <p> More than 2,000 years ago, Confucius said, "A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do you know that his future will not be equal to our present?" For the Party and the country, young people deserve the best protection and bear our highest expectations. They are like the young trees thriving on earth that will eventually grow into towering trees to provide shelter for those in need. They are like the rising sun whose energy keeps on increasing as it climbs up the sky until the moment when it lights and warms up the earth. The Party and the country place their hopes on the youth.</p> <p> As the Northern Shaanxi College was set up in 1937, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the inscription "We need to cultivate a large number of personnel who will become the vanguard of China's revolution. They are politically far-sighted and full of the spirit of struggle and self-sacrifice. They have largeness of mind and are loyal, active, and upright. They do not pursue any personal gain, but work for the sole purpose of national and social liberation. They always meet difficulty head-on with resolve and brave persistence. They are neither swaggerers nor people who seek the limelight, but rather practical people who keep their feet firmly on the ground. Once our country has a large number of such vanguard, the task of China's revolution will be carried out successfully." In present-day China, the Party and the people still need a large number of such vanguard, and the Party Central Committee earnestly hopes the Communist Youth League can deliver results in this regard. This is the ardent expectation of the Party as well as our motherland and people.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

The Taiwan region, as part of China, has never had the right to be a member.</p> <p> Taiwan's participation in WHO activities must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle, said Zhu. She said that the DPP authority has undermined the political foundation for cross-Strait consultation by clutching to its successionist agenda of "Taiwan independence," as well as twisting and denying the 1992 Consensus.</p> <p> By doing so, the DPP authority has diminished the political foundation for Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly, added Zhu.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Sunday urged European Union (EU) politicians to put themselves in the right position, recognize the historical trend, and immediately stop their futile meddling in Hong Kong affairs.</p> <p> The election of the sixth-term chief executive of the HKSAR was successfully held earlier on Sunday with John Lee elected as the chief executive designate by an overwhelming majority of votes in accordance with law.</p> <p> People from all sectors in the HKSAR have expressed warm congratulations. However, acting against international law and the basic norms governing international relations, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and a few other foreign politicians slandered the electoral system of the HKSAR, the election result and the Chinese central government's policies towards Hong Kong, said a spokesperson of the office.</p> <p> The spokesperson said the election is of great significance as this year marks the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the "one country, two systems" policy is entering a new period.</p> <p> As a successful practice in developing democracy with Hong Kong characteristics, the election further implemented the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," showed higher superiority of the new electoral system, and ensured Hong Kong's moving from chaos to stability and prosperity, said the spokesperson.</p> <p> The spokesperson pointed out that the election is fair and impartial and complies with laws and regulations, and the result testifies to the strong public support to Lee.</p> <p> The election, held under the new electoral system, shows that Hong Kong's democracy is advancing with the times and is good for Hong Kong's long-term stability and development, said the spokesperson.</p> <p> The spokesperson noted that over the past 25 years, the Chinese central government has fully and faithfully implemented the principles of "one country, two systems," "the people of Hong Kong administering Hong Kong," and a high degree of autonomy.</p> <p> The central government has firmly safeguarded national sovereignty, security, development interests, and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the spokesperson said, adding it has also resolutely supported the development of democracy with Hong Kong characteristics and protected all the lawful rights and freedoms enjoyed by the Hong Kong residents.</p> <p> Facts have proved that Hong Kong's new electoral system is an effective one in line with "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong's reality, according to the spokesperson.</p> <p> Facts will also prove in the future that the new chief executive elected under the new electoral system will lead the new term of the HKSAR government and people from all walks of life to forge ahead at a new starting point, create a new situation of sound governance in Hong Kong, promote the coordinated development of Hong Kong in economic, political, social and cultural fields, and further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a global financial, trade and shipping center, the spokesperson said.</p> <p> The spokesperson pointed out that some EU politicians, harboring the intention of using Hong Kong to contain China, confused black and white, and vilified the new electoral system and "one country, two systems."</p> <p> Any slander of the election result and any interference in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs are "botched political performances that run counter to the global trend and selective blindness to Hong Kong's genuine public opinion," said the spokesperson.</p> <p> The spokesperson stressed that Hong Kong is part of China and the election of the chief executive of the HKSAR is purely China's internal affair.</p> <p> The office urged all the external forces who attempt to meddle with China's internal affairs, including some EU politicians, to recognize the historical trend, change course, reflect on themselves, ditch double standards, abide by international law and the basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs in any form.</p> <p> "Otherwise they will only shoot themselves in the foot," the spokesperson said.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council on Sunday said Hong Kong has taken a fresh look with a new electoral system and is poised for a brighter future at a new starting point.</p> <p> The office expressed the view in an article released after John Lee won the election of the six-term chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) with an overwhelming majority of votes. It extended congratulations to Lee on winning the election.</p> <p> The chief executive election represented another successful practice of the HKSAR's new electoral system after the Election Committee elections last September and the election of the seventh-term Legislative Council last December, the office said.</p> <p> It has been proved by solid facts that the new system is a good one that follows the "one country, two systems" principle and is suited to Hong Kong's realities, the office said.</p> <p> Facts will also prove that the newly elected chief executive will certainly lead the new team of the HKSAR government and people from all sectors of society to stay united and strive for new prospects of good governance in Hong Kong at a new starting point, it added.</p> <p> <strong>SUCCESSFUL ELECTION WITH NEW LOOK</strong></p> <p> The election is the first HKSAR chief executive election held after Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order. It is of great significance and far-reaching influence and has drawn wide attention.</p> <p> The office hailed Sunday's election a complete success, saying it was achieved with the joint efforts of the HKSAR government and all sectors of society by conducting the election in strict accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR, relevant decisions of the National People's Congress and its standing committee, and relevant electoral laws of the HKSAR, and by overcoming the impact of COVID-19.</p> <p> "The election process was orderly, fair, safe, clean and with numerous highlights," it said.</p> <p> The election has focused on development and people's well-being and brought together strong positive energy, said the office, noting that the goals and tenets of vision put forward by Lee in his announcement of his candidacy have aroused strong response and broad resonance in Hong Kong.</p> <p> Recognizing the extensive and in-depth public participation in the election, the office said it fully demonstrates democracy. Since Lee announced his candidacy, he has made intensive visits to people from all walks of life, conducted online exchanges of views, and visited communities to extensively collect public opinions and introduce his election vision and manifesto.</p> <p> It can be said that the process for Lee to form and introduce his election manifesto was a process of democratic consultation in Hong Kong society.</p> <p> Lee has got wide support, the office said, noting that he was elected with 99.16 percent of the votes, which fully reflects the high recognition he gained in Hong Kong society.</p> <p> It is widely believed that Lee, who was promoted from a front-line police officer to chief secretary for administration of the HKSAR government, has rich grassroots experience and strong enforcement ability. He has taken a firm stand and stood the test with courage and sense of responsibility in the process of stopping violence and chaos and implementing the law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR.</p> <p> The general public in Hong Kong has full trust in and high expectations on Lee, believing that he can recruit talent to form a new administration team of the HKSAR government, achieve the goals with decisive administration, improve governance with an open mind, sincerely serve the public, and unite all sectors of society to write a new chapter.</p> <p> Throughout the whole process of the chief executive election, there was no longer wanton confrontation or arbitrary attacks and smears.</p> <p> The election is the true embodiment of the spirit of democracy, the office said.</p> <p> <strong>ADVANTAGES OF ELECTORAL SYSTEM SHOWN</strong></p> <p> The success of the election, the office noted, has once again proved the advanced nature and strengths of the new electoral system of the HKSAR.</p> <p> In strictly implementing the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," the new electoral system ensures the election of talented patriots administering Hong Kong, the office said.</p> <p> President Xi Jinping has stressed that to ensure the steady practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong in the long run, the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong" must be always upheld, it noted.</p> <p> "The criteria for a patriot are objective and clear," the office said. "A patriot is one who sincerely safeguards China's national sovereignty, security and development interests, respects and upholds the fundamental system of the country and the constitutional order in the HKSAR, and goes all out for prosperity and stability in Hong Kong."</p> <p> By preventing the forces that oppose China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong from participating in the HKSAR's government system, the new electoral system can ensure that the people elected to key public offices of the HKSAR are all firm patriots, the office said.</p> <p> The new electoral system of the HKSAR is committed to the building and development of a high-quality democracy with Hong Kong characteristics where the position of Hong Kong people as their own masters is fully guaranteed, the office said.</p> <p> The advantages and unique features of the new electoral system have been fully demonstrated in the three elections, it noted.</p> <p> First, it is broadly representative. Those who got elected are from various social groups, sectors and backgrounds and include a number of community-level and young people. They can extensively solicit opinions from the public and help smooth the operation of channels for different groups to make their voices heard about their rights and interests.</p> <p> Second, it is politically inclusive. Participants represent various political groups, espousing different political philosophies. Upholding the principle of loving the country and Hong Kong, the new electoral system has ensured inclusiveness and diversity to the greatest possible extent.</p> <p> Third, it ensures balanced participation. The design of the new electoral system for the HKSAR ensures balanced political participation and takes into consideration the different interests of all sectors of Hong Kong community, better striking a balance among the overall interest of Hong Kong and the interests of various sectors and different areas.</p> <p> Fourth, it guarantees fair competition. The candidates try their best to convince voters by focusing on their competitiveness in professional ability, election manifesto, idea, sense of responsibility and contribution, making the election more rational, fairer and better-organized. In that way, the new electoral system ensures that the process reflects popular will, pools people's wisdom and serves the good of the public. It is a broad-based and real democracy that works.</p> <p> The office said the new electoral system is conducive to upholding the executive-led system while improving the efficiency in administration. Hong Kong practices the executive-led system with the chief executive at its core, and the new electoral system helps to end the long-standing conflict between the legislative and executive agencies and solve the strife within the Legislative Council, enabling the HKSAR government and all sectors to concentrate on developing economy, improving people's livelihoods, and shoring up the region's strengths in global competition.</p> <p> The office said the improved electoral system optimizes and enhances the democracy of the HKSAR, effectively underpinning the long-term peace, stability and development of Hong Kong.</p> <p> <strong>HONG KONG POISED FOR BRIGHTER FUTURE</strong></p> <p> With the new electoral system put into full practice, the national security law in Hong Kong thoroughly implemented, and rectification carried out in key areas, Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order is further advanced, said the office. It added that the Hong Kong society now shows greater solidarity and harmony, and its business environment has been improved.</p> <p> As long as the new HKSAR government and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong seize the historical opportunities, and endeavor against all odds, Hong Kong is certain to embrace an even brighter tomorrow, the office noted.</p> <p> The conditions are in Hong Kong's favor. With the new electoral system in place, more patriots with outstanding capabilities are entering the administration structure of the HKSAR, forming a patriotic, responsible and united administrative team that serves the people.</p> <p> Hong Kong maintains its outstanding advantages. The Chinese central government unswervingly implements the principle of "one country, two systems" and opens up wider to the world. In this process, Hong Kong's unique status and functions are certain to be strengthened, instead of being weakened.</p> <p> Hong Kong has great opportunities. By integrating itself more into the overall national development, Hong Kong will see more space for development. The central government fully supports Hong Kong in participating in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road cooperation. In the meantime, the country's 14th Five-Year Plan specifically underscores the support for Hong Kong in elevating its position as an international center of finance, shipping and trade, and an international air traffic hub, among others.</p> <p> Hong Kong's development is safeguarded by the central government. Whenever Hong Kong faces difficulties, the motherland always reaches out a helping hand. For instance, in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, the central government fully supported Hong Kong's battle against the virus with decisive measures.</p> <p> Hong Kong's new starting point coincides with the country's new journey toward the second centenary goal of building a modern socialist country in all respects, said the office. It noted that this will surely create great synergy for development.</p> <p> In China's journey toward national rejuvenation, Hong Kong can not and will not be absent, stressed the office.</p> <p> "The 'Pearl of the Orient' will definitely shine brighter and adorn the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation," the office added.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> 　　BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has made new strides in developing democracy suited to its own realities, as the election of the HKSAR's sixth-term chief executive was smoothly held on Sunday.</p> <p> 　　With the successful election of the chief executive, as well as elections of the Legislative Council and the Election Committee last year, Hong Kong has seen its new electoral rules fully implemented, and the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong" further consolidated.</p> <p> 　　There was no democracy in Hong Kong when it was under British colonial rule. The return of Hong Kong to the motherland marked the opening chapter of its democracy.</p> <p> 　　However, for a certain period of time, anti-China agitators sabotaged the rule of law in Hong Kong, disrupted constitutional and social order, and attempted to put Hong Kong's democracy on a wrong path.</p> <p> 　　The central authorities have promptly improved the electoral system of Hong Kong in accordance with its conditions. It represents the continued improvements to Hong Kong's democratic institutions, and has laid a solid foundation for the healthy development of democracy in the region.</p> <p> 　　The election of the HKSAR's sixth-term chief executive was held in full accordance with laws and regulations, as well as in a fair, impartial and open manner, fully demonstrating the advantages of the new electoral system.</p> <p> 　　The restructured Election Committee has a wider social basis. It is more representative, with more balanced participation by all sectors of society. It thus will enable the chief executive elected under the new system to better represent the overall and fundamental interests of Hong Kong.</p> <p> 　　John Lee received 786 valid nominations from Election Committee members during the nomination period and won the election with 1,416 votes, showing that he has won the approval of the majority of Election Committee members and carries expectations of Hong Kong residents.</p> <p> 　　With the full implementation of the new election system, a number of talented patriots with ideals, a broad mind, a strong sense of responsibility, and competence will enter the governance structure of the HKSAR. They will be tasked with the great mission of facilitating the steady and sustained development of "one country, two systems."</p> <p> 　　Assuming such important roles when Hong Kong is going through a transition from stability to further prosperity, they must unite various sectors to serve the people faithfully, safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintain prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.</p> <p> 　　Under the leadership of the sixth-term chief executive and his team, Hong Kong will surely overcome difficulties and continue to forge ahead, writing a new chapter in the successful practice of "one country, two systems."&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>
