Unlike her usual transactions, this time she chose to pay in digital yuan, China's digital fiat currency, or the e-CNY.</p> <p> "I feel it is very convenient as it took me less than one minute to download the application and register an account," said Zhang. "There are also some discounts available now, so I'm willing to try the digital yuan."</p> <p> Like Zhang, many Chinese people are embracing the digital yuan with a positive attitude.

(Xinhua)</em></p> <p> <strong>MORE CONVENIENT</strong></p> <p> China has stepped up efforts to promote the digital yuan with pilot programs. Since 2017, the country has tested the use of the digital yuan in over 10 places from Shenzhen to Shanghai and Xiong'an New Area.</p> <p> The use of digital yuan is similar to that of WeChat Pay and Alipay, which are popular online payment apps in China. With QR code or Near Field Communication (NFC) techniques, the payment can be completed easily on mobile terminals of both shoppers and merchants. What makes digital yuan different is that it can still be used without a network.</p> <p> Tourists could pay in digital yuan at ticket windows, merchandise stores and restaurants from April 15, according to Liu Yiying, a finance manager of the management branch under Canton Tower Cultural Tourism Development Co., Ltd.</p> <p> "We launched preferential activities for digital yuan after the May Day holiday, which has attracted an increasing number of tourists," said Liu.</p> <p> In the tramline in Guangzhou's Haizhu District, the upgraded checking machines in passenger cars and stations also support digital yuan payment.</p> <p> Since the digital yuan payment was launched in April, hundreds of payments have been made cumulatively, with nearly 100 orders a day at most, according to Su Jun, deputy general manager of Guangzhou Tram.</p> <p> "From the perspective of enterprises' financial management, digital yuan improves the efficiency as the money paid by consumers can be transferred to our account in real time," said Su.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0515/FOREIGN202205150856000153108145656.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 595px;" /></p> <p> <em>People walk past a sign of digital yuan (e-CNY) during the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijng, capital of China, Sept. 5, 2021. (Xinhua/Wu Wei)</em></p> <p> <strong>MORE INSTITUTIONS COVERED</strong></p> <p> The pilot version of the digital yuan app was released on major Android app stores and Apple's App Store on Jan 4. Currently, the designated operators of digital yuan cover major Chinese banks, such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank, and online banks.</p> <p> "We promote discount campaigns for people using the digital yuan in supermarkets such as Guangzhou Grandbuy and Guangzhou Friendship Store, which can effectively stimulate the enthusiasm of consumers," said an official with the Guangzhou branch of ICBC. "The merchants are also free of service charge at the same time."</p> <p> Many internet platforms that gather rich consumption scenes are also opening up to embrace the digital currency, such as JD.COM, Tencent, Meituan and Bilibili.</p> <p> By the end of 2021, there were more than 8 million applicable scenarios of digital yuan in the pilot areas via WeChat, a social software developed by Tencent. The company said it has deeply participated in the design, research, development and operation of the digital currency since 2018.</p> <p> According to data from Meituan, more than 5 million sub-wallets of digital currency were pushed to the Meituan App, and more than 4 million users spent digital yuan on Meituan from last September to early May.</p> <p> Several banks in south China's metropolis of Shenzhen are to cooperate with Meituan to distribute red packets of digital yuan worth 30 million yuan (about 4.42 million U.S. dollars).</p> <p> "The pilot project of Meituan is a beneficial attempt to advocate simple, moderate, green and low-carbon life through digital currency," said Cao Heping, a professor at the School of Economics of Peking University.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0515/FOREIGN202205150857000565883392938.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>A passenger pays for a bus ticket in digital yuan (e-CNY) in southwest China's Chongqing, April 29, 2022.

The scale of users, merchants and transactions in the pilot areas has grown steadily.</p> <p> Guangzhou, as one of the pilot cities, has innovatively implemented new application scenarios such as granting talent subsidies and paying parallel imported cars with digital yuan and promoted the use of digital yuan in various scenarios such as transportation, supermarkets in business circles, tourism and online consumption platforms.</p> <p> China's digital yuan transactions hit nearly 87.57 billion yuan at the end of 2021, as the country ramped up research and pilot use of the central bank's digital currency.</p> <p> A total of 261 million personal wallets for the digital yuan had been opened, and the number of pilot scenarios had exceeded 8.08 million, said Zou Lan, an official with the PBOC.</p> <p> Zou said the central bank would continue promoting research and development of the digital fiat currency and further deepen the pilot use of e-CNY in retail services, government services, and other scenarios.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL</p> <p> Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.</p> <p> Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.</p> <p> "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."</p> <p> The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."</p> <p> Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.</p> <p> Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."</p> <p> Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.</p> <p> Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.</p> <p> "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.</p> <p> As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.</p> <p> "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.</p> <p> "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.</p> <p> From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.</p> <p> A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p> This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0515/FOREIGN202205150911000108339247797.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>ASEAN foreign ministers pose for a group photo during the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting (AMM Retreat) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Feb. 17, 2022. (Photo by Sovannara/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> <strong>ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE</strong></p> <p> Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.</p> <p> With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.</p> <p> The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.</p> <p> "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."</p> <p> The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.</p> <p> Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.</p> <p> "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.</p> <p> Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.</p> <p> "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.</p> <p> "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.</p> <p> <strong>VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN</strong></p> <p> It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.</p> <p> Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.</p> <p> "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.</p> <p> Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."</p> <p> "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Once Finland and Sweden join NATO, that number will be seven of eight, with only Russia outside the alliance.</p> <p> "It's significant because the states that govern the area will be dominated by NATO," Sciso said. "The countries involved are obligated to respect rules agreed to for the region on things ranging from fishing rights to nuclear testing, but they remain sovereign states and two of them are the world's largest nuclear powers."&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> DENVER, the United States, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Grocery store shelves were bare of baby formula around Denver and other cities in the United States Friday as the federal government continued unprecedented steps toward accelerating production and distribution of the vital supplement.</p> <p> U.S. President Joe Biden defended his response to the crisis Friday as Republicans and conservative media attacked his administration's actions.</p> <p> "If we'd been better mind readers I guess we could have (reacted faster)," he told CNN at a press conference.</p> <p> Across the country, mothers took to social media and drove up to 50 miles to look around amid baby food formula shortage, People, an American weekly magazine that specializes in celebrity news and human-interest stories, said Friday, calling the situation "very, very scary."</p> <p> One mother also told the Denver Channel that "my entire family just goes and finds the formula when we they can."</p> <p> "My sister picked me up some in Arvada yesterday, my dad up in Thornton the other day," Ashlee Lane, the mother of a 7-month-old, said of her family's efforts scouring the Denver area for baby formula.</p> <p> Data released this week by Datasembly, which tracks baby formula stock at more than 11,000 stores, showed that 43 percent of the top-selling baby formula products were out of stock as of the week ending May 8, and in five states, more than half of the top-selling formula products were missing from stores.</p> <p> At busy retail giant Target in Boulder, 50 km northwest of Denver, baby formula supplies were scarce and most store shelves were empty on Friday.</p> <p> "Usually they tell us when more is coming in," a store inventory clerk told Xinhua, pointing to her hand-held computer. "But this says zero are coming in and zero are expected soon."</p> <p> Nearby, at high-end grocer Whole Foods, the story was the same, even with non-traditional formula products that catered to mothers with money seeking organic baby food solutions.</p> <p> "We really noticed it in the past week," customer service representative Julian Bell said, "although our stock has been dwindling for several weeks."</p> <p> On Friday, the Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS) website posted that "manufacturers have ramped up production 30-50 percent," and that "yesterday, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including Walmart, Target, Reckitt, and Gerber, to discuss ways to get more formula quickly and safely onto store shelves."</p> <p> HHS pointed to the January recall of "certain powdered infant formulas" by industry leader Abbott Nutrition as a catalyst for the shortages, a federal response to four Michigan babies getting sick from the formula and two infant deaths between September and February.</p> <p> "The reason we're here is because the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) took the steps to ensure that babies were taking safe formula," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a press conference Thursday.</p> <p> "There were babies who died from taking this formula, so they were doing their jobs," Psaki said.</p> <p> Psaki announced a series of measures to alleviate the shortage, including efforts to speed up production and crack down on price gouging, as reports surfaced of individuals buying out store supplies and re-selling them on Ebay for huge profits.</p> <p> The Justice Department is now working with state attorney generals to monitor price-gouging in the formula market, and Biden said Thursday he had asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate reports of price-gouging.</p> <p> The Biden administration is also working to increase imports of formula, a new solution as the United States produces 98 percent of its formula supply, according to an administration fact sheet.</p> <p> On Friday, Biden also called for cutting red tape on the types of formula parents can buy, calling on the FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging and unfair market practices, and increase the supply of formula through increased imports.</p> <p> Congressional Democrats joined the president in demanding answers from baby formula manufacturers.</p> <p> In letters to the heads of four baby formula companies, Democratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney of New York and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois demanded documents and details about the shortage.</p> <p> "The national formula shortage poses a threat to the health and economic security of infants and families in communities throughout the country -- particularly those with less income who have historically experienced health inequities, including food insecurity," they wrote in letters sent to Mead Johnson Nutrition, Nestle USA, Perrigo Company and Abbott Nutrition.</p> <p> These companies control nearly 90 percent of the U.S. market for baby formula, the lawmakers said, requesting certain documents submitted by June 2.</p> <p> REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT THE CRISIS</p> <p> Republican leaders were quick to exploit the baby food crisis for their own political gain, slamming Biden on several fronts.</p> <p> "This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE in America," Elise Stefanik, a New York House Republican, wrote on Twitter. "Sadly, this has become the norm because of Joe Biden's radical agenda."</p> <p> "Unsurprisingly, when I reached out in February from my office to the FDA we received no substantive response. Joe Biden simply has no plan," Stefanik told the media at a press conference Thursday.</p> <p> "Instead, bare shelves. Biden has continued to pass the buck. This is not a Third World country. This should never happen in the United States of America. We're unified in demanding action to address this crisis," she added.</p> <p> Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, joined in: "This is sadly Joe Biden's America."</p> <p> "Working families are already struggling to put food on the table due to the skyrocketing costs of every day items, and now they are facing a crisis that is threatening the very lives of their newborn children," Wagner said.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Despite small fluctuations in daily new infection numbers, over 99 percent of new infections have been identified through testing in closed-loop management zones. In the past three days, only six cases were found in other areas.</p> <p> "The city now faces a critical transition from epidemic emergency response to a normalized prevention and control mode," Wu said.</p> <p> Further efforts will be made in epidemic control and prevention in key areas, including old neighborhoods and villages at risk of a resurgence, he added.</p> <p> "We're drafting an outline to consolidate the results of the prevention and control efforts so far and to prepare for the resumption of work, business and on-campus education and a return to normalcy," Wu said.</p> <p> Cars will be allowed back on the roads gradually while supermarkets, convenience stores and other types of businesses such as hairdressing will gradually be allowed to operate.</p> <p> "Students who need to sit exams, especially ninth, 11th and 12th graders in high schools, will be given priority to return to school. More healthcare institutions and government service windows will also be reopened gradually," he added.</p> <p> Over 9,900 nucleic acid testing sites have been set up and more than 5,700 of them were operational across the city as of Thursday, mainly providing services for residents in precautionary zones and people who have resumed work, Wu said.</p> <p> Shanghai reported 227 new locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases, 1,869 asymptomatic infections and two deaths on Thursday. The two who died were aged 88 and 89.</p> <p> "Given the large aging population that is vulnerable to the virus, vaccination acts as one of the most effective means to protect the elderly and we must promptly accelerate the vaccination of this group of people," said Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission.</p> <p> Shanghai administered around 100,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines between May 1 and 11, with about half of these given to people aged 60 and above, according to Zhao.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: China Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- About two and a half years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has seen not only an increase in infections and deaths, but also an orgy of racism and hate crimes against minority groups, particularly the Asian-American community.</p> <p> Following an apparently random yet violent murder of a young Korean-American woman in a Chinatown apartment here in February, mourners placed flowers, candles, photos, and cardboard signs condemning anti-Asian hatred around a tree outside the residential building where Christina Yuna Lee was stabbed to death.</p> <p> While the shock of Lee's death had yet to wear off, mourners were outraged that the makeshift memorial for Lee had been repeatedly vandalized.</p> <p> The temporary memorial was first vandalized in the middle of the night just three days after Lee's death, and it continued to be vandalized even in broad daylight.</p> <p> "So five times last month, and it just keeps increasing. It is very sad," Brian Chin, Lee's former landlord, told Xinhua.</p> <p> According to video clips from a surveillance camera shared by Chin, a man kicked at the flowers, candles, and signs in the early morning on March 2, and another pedestrian pulled down a cardboard sign about a week later.</p> <p> Every attack on the memorial is pretty much anti-Asian and "it is very scary right now," said Chin, whose family came to the United States from China over 60 years ago.</p> <p> "They're doing it with hate. They see her picture. They see the flowers and candles," Chin added.</p> <p> Lee's tragic death followed the fatal shoving of Asian American Michelle Alyssa Go onto subway tracks by a man at Times Square station on Jan. 15 and the death of Yaopan Ma in January in a racially motivated attack in East Harlem.</p> <p> "Her (Lee's) death is part of an alarming pattern of unchecked, hateful violence against women, namely women of Asian descent and women of color that can no longer stand without consequence," said one of Lee's relatives in an appeal on Gofundme.com.</p> <p> For Chin, a middle-aged man, the continued anti-Asian hate crimes had brought about unprecedented depression.</p> <p> "I think everyone is terrified right now that they will be attacked on the subways, on the streets, and then the guy will be out on the same day," he said.</p> <p> According to Chin, this wave of anti-Asian hatred began with very vitriolic language which claims COVID-19 as the so-called "Chinese flu" or "Wuhan flu."</p> <p> Kathleen Flynn-hui, whose husband originally came from Hong Kong, said that anti-Asian prejudice affects her family on a daily basis.</p> <p> "We've kind of always felt it, but not as strongly as now," said Flynn-hui, adding that she "dealt with discrimination against my husband because he was Asian the whole time."</p> <p> Chin said the situation is deteriorating due to a combination of politics, the impact of new laws, and the new Manhattan District Attorney's lenient stance on crime.</p> <p> "The cops are doing their job, but they arrest them, and they're free the next day due to the laws," said Chin.</p> <p> Right now, much stronger laws are needed to protect the Asian community, Chin said, calling on lawmakers, the city council, and the mayor to take stronger and more enforceable action.</p> <p> The Committee of 100, a non-profit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans, recently called on U.S. elected officials, law enforcement, and responsible media to address racism, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders immediately with actionable and concrete results.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded U.S.-ASEAN summit will not draw regional countries closer to the U.S. side, and the U.S. attempt to court support among ASEAN in pursuit of its geopolitical interests is unlikely to gain traction, experts have said.</p> <p> U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.</p> <p> U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL</p> <p> Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.</p> <p> Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.</p> <p> "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."</p> <p> The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."</p> <p> Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.</p> <p> Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."</p> <p> Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.</p> <p> Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.</p> <p> "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.</p> <p> As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.</p> <p> "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.</p> <p> "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.</p> <p> From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.</p> <p> A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p> This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."</p> <p> ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE</p> <p> Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.</p> <p> With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.</p> <p> The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.</p> <p> "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."</p> <p> The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.</p> <p> Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.</p> <p> "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.</p> <p> Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.</p> <p> "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.</p> <p> "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.</p> <p> VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN</p> <p> It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.</p> <p> Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.</p> <p> "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.</p> <p> Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."</p> <p> "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been exploiting democracy, human rights and aid as tools and weapons to incite division around the world and meddle in other countries' internal affairs, say political experts.</p> <p> "To influence domestic policies in recipient countries ... the U.S. has provided assistance to serve its goals and achieve its interests," Ayman Okeil, general manager of the Cairo-based Maat for Peace, Development, and Human Rights, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p> <p> THE NED AS A PROXY</p> <p> Among all the proxies Washington uses to serve its political agenda in other countries, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was founded in 1983 as a bipartisan, non-profit institution by the U.S. government, is one of the most active.</p> <p> Nominally a non-governmental organization that provides support for democracy abroad, the NED in fact relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the U.S. Congress, and takes orders from the U.S. government.</p> <p> Okeil described the NED as one of Washington's "soldiers" for interfering in other countries' decision-making process.</p> <p> The NED has worked as a substitute for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cultivating pro-U.S. opposition activists for subverting lawful governments and provoking uprisings in the Arab countries under the pretext of promoting democracy, he said.</p> <p> According to Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, the NED was founded as a tool for projecting political influence in different sovereign states that the U.S. government has labeled as "non-democratic, totalitarian, authoritarian and anti-American."</p> <p> The NED supported opposition groups in other countries, which were trained to represent Washington's interest, rather than the vital interests of their own nations and states, Rawashdeh pointed out.</p> <p> Echoing Rawashdeh's point, Okeil said that the NED has spent millions of U.S. dollars to support political parties, labor unions, dissident movements, and media in dozens of countries.</p> <p> The organization has been employed as the "mastermind" behind separatist riots, color revolutions, and political crises around the world, with the aim of toppling legitimate governments and creating U.S. puppets in targeted countries, said Ahmad Ashqar, a Syrian journalist and political expert.</p> <p> The NED makes sure that nations across the globe do what the United States wants them to do and in no way feel confident and capable of pursuing their own political/ideological agendas, Rawashdeh said. "And this is also what the U.S. foreign policy is doing for decades."</p> <p> A NEW TYPE OF IMPERIALISM</p> <p> The United States, unfortunately, has created a new type of imperialism, by occupying foreign countries with money and forces and interfering in their choice of leaders and party compositions, Okeil told Xinhua.</p> <p> Unlike the funds that came from some countries like China, which help improve health, education and development sectors, the U.S. economic aid is always with conditions attached, he noted</p> <p> Okeil's words are not groundless. According to a study by the American University in Cairo in November 2021, the NED has allocated more than 606 million dollars in "democracy assistance" to Egypt in the period between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the U.S. government provided 415 million dollars in economic assistance to Egypt, which includes 55 million dollars to support programs for promoting democracy.</p> <p> However, as Tariq Fahmy, a political science professor at the Cairo University, noted, the U.S. mode of democracy has not been successful in the Middle East, and it contradicts many countries' unique conditions.</p> <p> "We all saw the disgraceful role in provoking the Arab Spring via funding the protesters" under the cover of democracy and human rights, Fahmy said, explaining that such kind of imposed democracy couldn't breed stability.</p> <p> After the Arab Spring, many people in the Middle East have started to see the real objectives behind the U.S. aid when knowing that Washington had a role in inciting the Arab Spring uprisings via supporting, training and funding young protesters, Okeil noted.</p> <p> The U.S. model of democracy is not suitable for the world, and based on that model, the U.S. policies led to real crimes, Fahmy said.</p> <p> It's a fact that the United States has distorted the positive meaning of democracy and emptied such a notion of anything useful and beneficial for other countries, Ashqar argued.</p> <p> "We have seen several examples like in Syria, where the United States used democracy as a pretext to support separatist forces and radical ones to destabilize the legitimate government," he said. "The U.S. presence in Syria has achieved all but the so-called democracy."</p> <p> "Under the pretext of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy, the U.S. has stolen key areas in Syria rich with oil and gas, do you call that democracy?" asked the Syrian journalist.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Police are yet to identify the deceased, and the injured have been admitted to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital.</p> <p> Firefighters used heavy cranes to reach the top floor of the building, and 27 fire tenders were sent to contain the blaze when smoke surrounded the entire building.</p> <p> Video clips showed people trying to escape the building using a rope and hanging from broken windows. Many people could be seen trying to jump to another building.</p> <p> "There was only one staircase and because of that people could not go out. I think the building did not have a proper no objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department," Satpal Bhardwaj, divisional officer of the Delhi fire department told media.</p> <p> Police said they have arrested the owners of the company, but the owner of the building who did not have safety clearance from the fire department is on the run.</p> <p> Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed grief over the deaths in the fire.</p> <p> "Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a tragic fire in Delhi. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery," Modi wrote on social media.</p> <p> Chances of fire in Indian buildings are usually high as people often ignore safety standards vis-a-vis fire.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- "The right way forward for humanity is peaceful development and win-win cooperation," Chinese President Xi Jinping told the 2022 World Economic Forum (WEF) virtual session in mid-January, offering China's solutions to global challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p> "Different countries and civilizations may prosper together on the basis of respect for each other, and seek common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences," he added.</p> <p> Xi's remarks elaborated on "Xiconomics," or the economics philosophy of the Chinese president, demonstrating China's commitment to building a harmonious world, promoting common development and enhancing the common interests of mankind.</p> <p> OPENING WIDER</p> <p> "We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges," Xi said in his special address, giving insight into a world battered by both the COVID-19 pandemic and sluggish economic growth.</p> <p> In the past two years, under the guidance of Xi's economic thought, China has struck a fine balance between pandemic control and economic development.</p> <p> In 2020, China has emerged as the only major economy with positive growth. In 2021, its gross domestic product saw a year-on-year increase of 8.1 percent, contributing around a quarter to world economic growth and beating most market expectations. The country has also played a crucial and irreplaceable role in supporting the global supply chains.</p> <p> Alexander Petrov, a professor at St. Petersburg State University, said China's success has proved that in a socialist market economy, it is possible to coordinate the efficiency of economic development and social governance, which is needed for global economic recovery in the post-pandemic era.</p> <p> China has once again become one "driving force of the global economy," said Jochen Goller, president and CEO of BMW China, who spoke highly of China's concerted efforts and strong resilience in both successfully fighting against COVID-19 and boosting economic recovery.</p> <p> China's steady growth has served as a stabilizer for the world economy amid the pandemic. It has been implementing a development philosophy featuring openness and cooperation, which helped strengthen global solidarity for economic recovery.</p> <p> "Countries around the world should uphold true multilateralism. We should remove barriers, not erect walls. We should open up, not close off. We should seek integration, not decoupling. This is the way to build an open world economy," Xi said, urging countries worldwide to "make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, and to fully unleash the vitality of the world economy."</p> <p> Humphrey Moshi, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam of Tanzania, said that "China has been on the front line of encouraging multilateralism among global countries, and it has been doing that through cooperation on the principles of a win-win situation."</p> <p> "As a staunch supporter of globalization, China has been actively participating in and promoting international cooperation against COVID-19, providing medical equipment and COVID-19 vaccines to many countries," Moshi said.</p> <p> "China stands ready to work with all countries to build an open world economy so that the spring breeze of openness will bring warmth to all parts of the world," Xi said at the opening ceremony of the fourth China International Import Expo in November 2021, reiterating China's resolve to open wider and with a high standard.</p> <p> From shortening the negative list for foreign investment and improving the business environment to expanding institutional opening-up, China has honored its commitments by offering more opportunities to other countries, which injected fresh momentum into global economic recovery.</p> <p> Honson To, chairman of KPMG China and Asia Pacific, said China has kept opening wider to the world, upheld and acted on multilateralism, as well as actively pushed for a more inclusive global cooperation, sending a positive signal that China is willing to work together with other countries for a better future.</p> <p> BENEFIT FOR ALL</p> <p> At a time when the international community is struggling to reduce the development gap and secure equal opportunities for all, China has offered its solution to the problem by underlining the people's desire for a happy life.</p> <p> "No matter what difficulties may come our way, we must adhere to a people-centered philosophy of development, place development and livelihoods front and center in global macro-policies, realize the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build greater synergy among existing mechanisms of development cooperation to promote balanced development worldwide," Xi said at January's forum.</p> <p> In the eyes of Raphael Tuju, secretary-general of Kenya's ruling Jubilee Party, this people-centered philosophy of development Xi emphasized is well manifested in the Chinese president's famous remarks that "for the good of my people, I will put aside my own well-being."</p> <p> By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.</p> <p> Its own people's well-being is not the only thing China cares about. As Xi noted, "on the road to the well-being of all mankind, no country or nation should be left behind."</p> <p> From China's growth to inclusive and common development of countries worldwide, Xi's economic thought addresses the need of the development of mankind through a variety of cooperation frameworks, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p> <p> The Mombasa-Nairobi Railway is a mega project under the BRI. It boosted Kenya's economy by significantly improving freight transportation, brought substantial benefits to local people, and at the same time protected the local ecological environment.</p> <p> This is the beginning of the transformation, which will create jobs, hope, opportunities and prosperity for all Kenyans, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said during a test ride of the railway.</p> <p> Another landmark project of Belt and Road cooperation is the 1,035-km China-Laos Railway, which has opened the landlocked country in Southeast Asia and connected it to markets as far away as in Europe since the railway's operation on Dec. 3, 2021.</p> <p> Sommad Pholsena, vice president of the National Assembly of Laos, said while China was not the first country to express a willingness to build a railway in Laos, it was the only one to turn it into reality.</p> <p> Xi's proposal to enhance interconnectivity and promote common development provides an opportunity for cooperation among developing countries, Pholsena said.</p> <p> According to the World Bank, BRI transport projects could, by 2030, help lift 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million people out of moderate poverty globally.</p> <p> "The more we study the BRI and witness its continuous advancement, the more we can appreciate the vision and the wisdom of President Xi's economic thought on world development," said former Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf.</p> <p> DEVELOPMENT FOR GOOD</p> <p> To tackle global challenges and seek sustainable development, the Chinese president has been promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.</p> <p> Mankind was presented with two choices -- one is vicious competition or even armed conflict for power and self-interest, which may well lead to a disastrous crisis, Xi said when addressing the CPC (the Communist Party of China) in Dialogue with the World Political Parties High-Level Meeting in 2017.</p> <p> "The other is for us to go along with the tide of the times and rise to challenges through global collaboration," he said. "This, in turn, will create favorable conditions for building a community with a shared future for mankind."</p> <p> For Khalid Taimur Akram, executive director of the Center for Global and Strategic Studies in Islamabad, the notion of building a community with a shared future for mankind bears significance for today's global development.</p> <p> China has provided a platform for all to turn this vision into reality, as the international community is searching for ways to advance cooperation and resolve differences, Akram said.</p> <p> In his speech in September 2021 at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly via video, Xi said "we must revitalize the economy and pursue more robust, greener and more balanced global development. Development holds the key to people's well-being."</p> <p> He then urged countries around the world to "work together to steer global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth," and proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) to this end.</p> <p> Speaking highly of the GDI, Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Liberata Mulamula said the pandemic serves as a reminder that the world is a community and no country should be left behind.</p> <p> Since Xi brought up the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind in 2013, China has been enriching it to reflect the hope of people from all countries for a better world.</p> <p> "We should follow the trend of history, work for a stable international order, advocate common values of humanity, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We should choose dialogue over confrontation, inclusiveness over exclusion, and stand against all forms of unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony or power politics," Xi said at the WEF meeting in January.</p> <p> The notion of a community with a shared future is the right path for human development, which could help reduce global inequality, said Ronnie Lins, director of the China-Brazil Center for Research and Business.</p> <p> The Chinese president's philosophy is of profound theoretical significance, said Maxim Rybachuk, leading researcher at the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p> <p> "We are talking about development concepts such as inclusive growth and dual circulation that have benefited both the Chinese people and people in other countries," Rybachuk said.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Brent crude for July delivery increased 4.1 dollars, or 3.8 percent, to close at 111.55 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange.</p> <p> The rally came despite data released Friday by Houston-based oilfield services company Baker Hughes showing that the number of total active drilling rigs in the United States rose by nine to 714 this week.</p> <p> Oil rigs in the United States rose by six to 563 this week , gas rigs rose by three to 149, and miscellaneous rigs stayed unchanged at two, showed the data.</p> <p> Concerns over supply risks lingered as the European Union (EU) worked on gaining support for an oil embargo against Russia.</p> <p> Last week, the EU unveiled a plan to phase out Russian crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of the year, as part of its sixth sanction package aimed against Moscow.</p> <p> Hungary and other Eastern European countries, whose economies are largely reliant on Russian oil, are not ready yet to accept the sanction package in its current form.</p> <p> Traders also weighed risks to the demand side.</p> <p> In its monthly report released on Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries revised down its forecast for world oil demand growth in 2022, citing impacts from geopolitical tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p> For the week, the U.S. crude standard rose 0.7 percent, while Brent declined 0.7 percent, based on the front-month contracts.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Its disrespect for ASEAN members concerning scheduling issues despite its pledge of "enduring commitment" has sparked a wave of complaints among ASEAN members, resulting in a postponement of the summit from late March to May.</p> <p> Cambodian Minister attached to the Prime Minister Kao Kim Hourn said before the summit that if Washington was serious about improving its ties with ASEAN, it should have arranged bilateral meetings between the United States and ASEAN countries. ASEAN leaders "should be treated with respect and equality," he noted.</p> <p> The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements. The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.</p> <p> Many sober minds in ASEAN have seen through this duplicity and bullying. Indonesia and Malaysia warned that AUKUS could lead to a major arms race in the region. A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="/mediafile/pic/BIG/20220514/71/5892171399547127135.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on March 24, 2022 shows the U.S. national flag (R) on the U.S. Embassy building in Moscow, Russia. (Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)</em></p> <p> Meanwhile, the White House will attempt in vain during this summit to talk ASEAN into imposing sanctions against Russia. Ever since the escalation of the current Ukraine crisis, Washington has been trying to exert pressure on ASEAN to take sides, but most of ASEAN members did not follow suit.</p> <p> On April 7, six of the 10-member bloc abstained from voting in favor of a resolution to remove Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and two voted against it. Long adhering to an independent foreign policy, ASEAN members have urged solving the crisis through negotiation and dialogue.</p> <p> Moreover, some ASEAN members have been well aware of Washington's unspoken calculations to turn bloody sufferings of others into golden opportunities for profits in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during his visit to China in early April, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said he appreciates China's objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, that "Asian countries should maintain peace and stability in the region, jointly resist unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law, and prevent attempts to create tensions and replicate crises in the region."</p> <p> Playing small clique politics and forcing others to take sides -- Washington's old tricks to gain geopolitical interests -- work against ASEAN's will to uphold regional peace and stability and to realize sustainable economic development. Launching trade wars and breaking pacts -- Washington's classical acts of unilateralism -- severely disrupt normal trade exchanges and supply chains in the region and deal a heavy blow to ASEAN's economy. All those wrongdoings have tarnished Washington's credit and influence as the world's sole superpower, and driven it further apart from ASEAN members.</p> <p> The long arc of history teaches each and every country that acting without scruples almost always results in the reverse of what one desires. It is time for Washington to learn this lesson, abandon its old dream of Cold War hegemony, uphold an open and inclusive mindset, and play its due role in maintaining regional and global peace, stability and development.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Maria Ferm, member of the Green Party, told Swedish Television, emphasizing her party's opposition to joining NATO.</p> <p> "We have therefore submitted a special opinion about this issue and about this analysis, because we do not agree with all the wording about NATO this analysis contains," Ferm emphasized.</p> <p> "I think there is no analysis of the risks that a Swedish NATO membership entails."

Large retail companies in Shanghai have started to reopen their supermarkets amid the recent COVID-19 resurgence. (Xinhua/Chen Jianli)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has exerted downward pressure on the Chinese economy. With an array of pro-growth policies to produce their intended effects, the risk is manageable and the sound fundamentals of the world's second-largest economy in the medium-to-long term will not change.</p> <p> To cope with the pandemic, China has applied a stringent dynamic zero-COVID policy. As the pandemic is still raging across the world and coronavirus continues to mutate, there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning how the situation will develop. The country has warned against any slackening in its efforts to control the virus.</p> <p> China's stance has been firm and clear -- unswervingly adhering to the dynamic zero-COVID policy while shoring up the economy and ensuring people's lives are affected as little as possible.</p> <p> Giving proper consideration to all these aspects is a difficult task. The earnest implementation of this policy is a major test for all regions and departments.</p> <p> A string of pro-growth policies is in the pipeline. China has already adopted multi-pronged fiscal measures in tax and fee cuts, public budget expenditure and bond issuance to stabilize the economy and ensure its people's wellbeing.</p> <p> Moreover, China has accelerated the establishment of a unified domestic market, comprehensively strengthened infrastructure construction, and deepened reform and opening-up across the board.</p> <p> The State Council and relevant departments are also rolling out detailed policies and measures to help industries, individually owned businesses and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises hit hard by the pandemic, and to stabilize market entities.</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="/mediafile/pic/BIG/20220514/78/15009916851255006974.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Photo shows staff members work in a workshop at Songz Automobile Air Conditioning Co.

(Xinhua/Zhang Jiansong)</em></p> <p> Chinese authorities have ample space and diversified tools for fiscal, monetary and other policies. They have rich experience in responding to downward pressure on the economy and will further strengthen regulatory control, and will do so when the time is right.</p> <p> The Chinese economy is off to a steady start this year, with its GDP up 4.8 percent year on year in the first three months. Despite the downward pressure, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, including its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. After pro-growth policies gradually produce their intended effects, China's economic performance will improve.</p> <p> By contributing approximately 30 percent to world economic growth, the Chinese economy is the largest engine driving global economic growth. The Chinese economy is at a critical moment in overcoming its difficulties. It is only by remaining confident and rising to the challenges that China can turn adverse situations into opportunities, embrace its bright prospects, continue to inject dynamism into the stability and recovery of the global economy and bring broader market opportunities for all countries.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday expressed firm opposition to recent smearing remarks and interference in China's internal affairs by Japan and the European Union (EU), urging them to abandon the zero-sum game mindset.</p> <p> Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to a query about a joint statement issued by Japan and the EU at a summit on Thursday, which expressed "concerns" over the situation of the Diaoyu Islands, East China Sea, South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, as well as so-called human rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.</p> <p> Japan and the EU have hyped up China-related issues, made smearing remarks against China, interfered in China's internal affairs and instigated regional confrontation, Zhao said. "China is firmly opposed to such practice, and has lodged stern representation with relevant parties."</p> <p> Zhao said the Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands have always been an inherent part of the Chinese territory, adding no matter what is said or done, the fact can never be altered that the islands belong to China.</p> <p> Regarding maritime issues, Zhao said China will firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and at the same time is ready to settle differences with relevant countries via consultations.</p> <p> As for issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, Zhao said they all fall within China's internal affairs, which brook no interference by any external forces. "We urge relevant countries to focus on putting their own house in order."</p> <p> China's development means important opportunities for the world, Zhao said, citing facts that China's economy has contributed 30 percent to the world economic growth, and China's achievements in COVID-19 response have helped stabilize the global supply chain. The Belt and Road Initiative has benefited more than 180 countries and international organizations.</p> <p> "The so-called China threat theory has gone bankrupt in face of facts," Zhao said.</p> <p> Noting the world needs unity and cooperation more than ever before in face of challenges such as the resurgences of COVID-19 and lackluster economic recovery, Zhao urged Japan and the EU to abandon seeking ideological confrontation and a zero-sum game mindset, to practice real multilateralism and inject more positive energy into the world.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Data from the country’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) showed that China’s imports and exports of services totaled over 1.45 trillion yuan ($214.6 billion) in the first quarter of 2022, rising 25.8 percent year on year.</p> <p> Its exports of services grew 30.8 percent to 713.98 billion yuan and imports of services reached 743.01 billion yuan with a year-on-year increase of 21.3 percent. The growth of services exports outpaced import growth by 9.5 percentage points, resulting in a 56.4-percent drop in the country’s services trade deficit to 29.03 billion yuan from the same period last year.</p> <p> Zhao Zhonghui, director of the translation center of BERIS Engineering and Research Corporation in Qingdao city, east China’s Shandong province, has been busy dubbing a program of Shandong TV into Lao with her colleagues.</p> <p> “This is a new service export project we launched this year. We’ve so far finished translating the Chinese subtitles into Lao, English and Romanian, and basically accomplished the dubbing work,” said Zhao, adding that the program will be aired on Lao National Television and Romanian public television TVR in a few days.</p> <p> According to Zhao, the company completed the multilingual dubbing and subtitle translation of more than 10,000 standard episodes of TV programs in 2021. The programs it exported last year, which were 450,000 minutes in total length, have been broadcast on TV stations and online video platforms in 195 countries and regions and received over 10 billion hits globally, bringing the company an export value of several billion yuan.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0514/FOREIGN202205140851000026691279557.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 675px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on Sept. 7, 2021 shows the exhibition area of the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) at the China National Convention Center in Beijing.

The introduction and implementation of the negative list represented a major breakthrough in the management model of trade in services and signaled further opening-up in cross-border trade in services.</p> <p> An MOFCOM official recently disclosed that the country plans to formulate a negative list for cross-border trade in services that is applicable to all of its 21 pilot free trade zones (FTZs) this year, and will promote the introduction of a national negative list for cross-border services trade in due course.</p> <p> In March, the general office of the MOFCOM issued a circular on making good use of the guidance funds for the innovative development of services trade to support the development of new trade forms and models, encouraging leveraging new ways of financing to stimulate new trade forms and models.</p> <p> The MOFCOM and six other government departments lately approved a new batch of 40 specialized bases for featured services export. China is now home to 112 bases for featured services export, which cover seven fields including culture, traditional Chinese medicine, digital services, human resources, geographic information, intellectual property and language services.</p> <p> The 2022 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), which is scheduled to be held both online and offline in September, will focus on trends in services trade, highlight digitalization and green development, and add a thematic exhibition of environment services.</p> <p> Six kinds of activities will be held during this year’s CIFTIS, including the Global Trade in Services Summit, exhibition, conference and forum, promotion and negotiation, achievement release as well as supporting activities.</p> <p> The exhibition will cover an area of no less than 126,000 square meters, and over 100 conferences, forums, promotion and negotiation activities will be held.</p> <p> As an important part of international trade and a major field of international economic and trade cooperation, services trade plays a key role in building a new development pattern.</p> <p> Last year, the value added of China’s service sector accounted for 53.3 percent of the country’s GDP, and the country’s total trade in services reached 5.3 trillion yuan, ranking second in the world for eight consecutive years.</p> <p> On the whole, China’s trade in services is characterized by constantly expanding scale, steadily increasing added value and continuously growing competitiveness, and still has huge potential for growth and great market opportunities.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

At 8:54 a.m. on May 10, Tianzhou-4 conducted a fast automated rendezvous and docking at the rear docking port of the Tianhe core module of China’s space station, delivering goods to its destination within few hours after launch.</p> <p> All the food, clothing, equipment and other supplies astronauts need for long-term stay in space must be carried to space station in time by cargo spacecraft, as well as the fuel the space station requires to maintain its orbit.</p> <p> Last year, Long March-7 Y3 and Long March-7 Y4 carrier rockets sent the Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft, respectively, into space, delivering supplies for the construction of the country’s space station.</p> <p> This time, before the arrival of the three crew members, the Tianzhou-4 cargo ship carried the necessary supplies for the forthcoming six-month Shenzhou-14 crewed mission to the space station. The cargo vessel brought more than 200 sets of items into orbit, including consumables for the Shenzhou-14 crew, propellants, gadgets, equipment, and samples for application experiments and testing, as well as replacement components and payloads.</p> <p> Tianzhou-4, after rendezvous and docking with the combination of the space station core module Tianhe and the Tianzhou-3 cargo craft, joined the combination.</p> <p> In order to ensure supplies can be delivered to the space accommodations safely, the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft has used cargo bags, racks, and storage tanks to carry goods. The categories and quantities of the transported goods vary according to the needs of the space station.</p> <p> Simultaneously, the cargo craft can also undertake tasks including controlling the attitude and orbital trajectory of the space station and supporting space science experiment.</p> <p> According to a designer with Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, the construction of China’s space station is like putting together building blocks, and the docking mechanism is the joint that connects various modules with each other.</p> <p> Since China’s first-ever rendezvous and docking of two spacecraft in 2011, the country has successfully carried out rendezvous and docking of spacecraft for 19 times, which laid a solid technological foundation for the construction of its space station.</p> <p> The docking mechanism is going to face bigger tests this year as it will need to connect the Wentian and Mengtian lab modules with the space station combination.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0514/FOREIGN202205140859000355364753074.jpg" style="width: 700px; height: 441px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo shows China’s Long March-7 Y5 carrier rocket.

Besides, huge docking energy can be generated during the process, which poses high requirements on the docking mechanism’s buffering and energy dissipation capacity.</p> <p> To make sure two heavyweight spacecraft can dock with each other successfully, designers have carried out massive studies and research on relevant plans and finally mastered the key technology.</p> <p> The launch of the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft is expected to be followed by the launch of the Shenzhou-14 crewed mission in June, the Wentian lab module in July, and the Mengtian lab module in October. The two lab modules and the Tianhe core module will form a T-shaped structure, with the core module at the center and the two lab modules attached to each side of it. The formation of the basic structure will signal the completion of the space station.</p> <p> Hao Chun, director of the CMSA, says that upon the completion of the in-orbit construction of the space station this year, it will enter a phase of application and development that is expected to span over 10 years.</p> <p> “The initial plan is to launch two manned spacecraft and two cargo spacecraft each year. Astronauts will stay in the space station for a long time to carry out space science experiments and to maintain the space station,” Hao said.</p> <p> As the first launch mission of the space station missions in 2022, the launch of the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft marked the beginning of the in-orbit construction of the space station and made people start counting down to the completion of “a new home in space” that will benefit all humanity.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>
