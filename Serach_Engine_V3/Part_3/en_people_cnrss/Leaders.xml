(Gaoligong mountain national nature reserve/Handout via Xinhua)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- As the global community celebrates the International Day for Biological Diversity on Saturday, China is exploring a solution to tackle the universal issue of biodiversity loss under the leadership of President Xi Jinping.</p> <p> Piloting a market-based mechanism for green growth, China is actively fostering a new man-nature relationship in which both can prosper, living together in harmony.</p> <p> "Ecological environmental protection and economic development are intertwined and complement each other," said Xi during a recent study session attended by the country's top leaders.</p> <p> "Building ecological civilization and promoting green and low-carbon circular development not only meets people's growing needs for a beautiful environment, but also promotes higher-quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable and safer development," he said.</p> <p> By carrying out major biological conservation projects and improving the mechanisms to encourage the green transition, China's practice sheds light on how ecological strength can be turned into economic strength.</p> <p> <strong>COMMUNITY OF LIFE</strong></p> <p> Surrounded by high mountains and deep valleys, the Gongshan Drung-Nu Autonomous County in southwest China's Yunnan Province is home to the Drung ethnic group, a small community that makes a living mainly by raising animals, especially bees.</p> <p> As part of their beekeeping activity, local residents use as many as 38 kinds of plants to attract bees, build their homes and repel them where necessary. The bees pollinate local herbs, which people in the community sell to improve their lives.</p> <p> The beekeeping techniques used by the Drung ethnic have been selected as a key biodiversity conservation project by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment to showcase the synergy that can exist between man and nature.</p> <p> Addressing the Leaders Summit on Climate in April, Xi called on the international community to work together to foster a community of life for man and nature.</p> <p> "We need to look for ways to protect the environment, grow the economy, create jobs and remove poverty, all at the same time," he said.</p> <p> Just like the beekeeping project, the country's many ecological conservation efforts have disproved the assumption that there must be trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection.</p> <p> The Yangtze River Economic Belt, covering nine provinces and two municipalities, is undergoing a green transition under Xi's leadership.</p> <p> Stressing high-quality development of the region, Xi has reiterated that the restoration of the ecological environment of the Yangtze River should be a major priority.</p> <p> Over the years, the country has shut down a large number of highly polluting and energy-intensive enterprises along the river and put into effect a 10-year fishing ban in pivotal waters to restore degrading biodiversity.</p> <p> In the first quarter of this year, the region's 11 provinces and municipalities reported rapid economic growth, with their combined gross domestic product accounting for 46.5 percent of the country's total, higher than the 2020 and 2019 levels.</p> <p> <strong>MARKET-BASED MECHANISM</strong></p> <p> To better coordinate economic development and environmental protection, China is actively exploring and improving a market-based mechanism for green growth.</p> <p> China will establish a sound mechanism for realizing the value of ecological products so that the protection and restoration of the ecological environment can be awarded a reasonable return, while the cost of damaging the environment can be paid correspondingly, Xi said at the study session.</p> <p> Under the guidance of Xi's thought on ecological progress, China issued a guideline in April, vowing to establish a basic policy framework for the realization of the value of ecological products by 2025.</p> <p> The various problems surrounding ecological products, such as the difficulty of valuing and trading them, will have been effectively resolved by that time, and an incentive mechanism to encourage environmental protection will take shape.</p> <p> The country's ability to transform ecological advantages into economic advantages will have been significantly enhanced by then, according to the guideline.</p> <p> Governments at different levels have taken measures to include indicators of green growth into their evaluation systems.</p> <p> China's southern tech hub Shenzhen has established a "gross ecosystem product" (GEP) accounting system, which is the total value of final ecosystem goods and services supplied to human well-being and sustainable economic and social development, according to the municipal bureau of ecology and environment.</p> <p> The bureau said GDP will no longer be the sole measure of Shenzhen's development in the future, and GEP will become an important indicator for the city's green growth.</p> <p> In addition to its efforts in achieving modernization that features harmony between nature and humans, China also aims to work closely with its global partners to restore the ecological balance on Earth, honoring its commitments while encouraging others to do so.</p> <p> China will actively participate in global environmental governance, improve South-South cooperation, and cooperate with neighboring countries, Xi said.</p> <p> In October this year, the country will host the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) in Kunming of Yunnan. Participants are expected to work out concrete plans for post-2020 global biodiversity protection.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

The law grants foreign-invested enterprises access to government procurement markets through fair competition and bans using administrative licensing and penalties to force foreign investors to transfer technology.</p> <p> The negative list for overseas investors was shortened time and again to further ease market access.</p> <p> More specifically, the country scrapped foreign ownership restrictions on the automotive industry in 2018, with overseas car-making giants such as BMW and Tesla responding quickly by expanding their presence in the Chinese market.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2021/0419/FOREIGN202104190821000174663100468.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>A man works at the Tiexi Plant of BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, Feb. 17, 2020.

China has decided to accept the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and strengthen the control of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), he added.</p> <p> Responding to climate change is the common cause of all humanity, he said, adding that it should not be a bargaining chip for geopolitics, a target for attacking other countries, or an excuse for trade barriers.</p> <p> Xi said China will adhere to the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, promote the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, and actively develop South-South cooperation on climate change.</p> <p> It is hoped that developed economies will set an example in reducing emissions and take the lead in fulfilling their funding commitments to provide adequate technical and capacity-building support for developing countries to tackle climate change, Xi said.</p> <p> Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading globally, and the world faces daunting tasks in global economic recovery, Xi said China-Europe relations are facing new development opportunities and various challenges. He called for firmly grasping the overall development direction of China-Europe ties from a strategic height.</p> <p> China will expand high-level opening-up and create a fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for foreign-invested enterprises, including French and German companies, he said. He expressed the hope that Europe can also treat Chinese enterprises with such a positive attitude and work together with China to strengthen the China-Europe green and digital partnerships and enhance cooperation in combating the pandemic.</p> <p> Xi said China opposes "vaccine nationalism" and a man-made vaccine divide, and is willing to work with the international community, including France and Germany, to ensure timely access to vaccines for the developing world.</p> <p> China stands ready to work with the International Olympic Committee to provide vaccines to athletes preparing to enter the Olympic Games, he said.</p> <p> Macron said that France welcomes China's announcement to become carbon-neutral before 2060. Such a massive commitment reflects China's initiative to assume significant responsibilities. France is willing to work with China to promote the further progress of France-China and Europe-China economic relations, help Africa achieve green development, and help developing countries reduce their debt.</p> <p> Vaccines should not become a tool for competition among major countries, Macron said. He added that France is willing to strengthen cooperation with China on the equitable distribution of vaccines and strengthen coordination on regional issues, including the Iran nuclear issue.</p> <p> Merkel said that it is extremely important for Germany, France, and China to strengthen cooperation in tackling climate change. The nationally determined contributions China announced are both ambitious and challenging and are very important in coping with climate change globally.</p> <p> She said that Europe is willing to strengthen policy communication and alignment with China. China's economy realized a recovery growth first, which is good news for the world. Germany values the opportunities that the implementation of China's 14th Five-Year Plan brings to Germany-China and Europe-China cooperation, and is willing to deepen mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation with China, strengthen communication on issues such as the digital economy and network security, and treat enterprises from all countries equally and avoid trade barriers.</p> <p> She expressed the hope that with joint efforts from both sides, the EU-China investment agreement will take effect at an early date.</p> <p> The three leaders agreed that it is necessary to uphold multilateralism, fully implement the Paris Agreement, and jointly build a fair, reasonable, cooperative, and win-win global climate governance system, and promote this summit to achieve positive, balanced, and pragmatic results.</p> <p> They agreed to strengthen climate policy dialogue and green development cooperation, and make climate change cooperation an important pillar in China-Europe cooperation.</p> <p> All sides agreed to coordinate in running the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to be held this year in China's Kunming, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Britain, and the 7th International Union for Conservation of Nature's World Conservation Congress in the French city of Marseilles, to create a new pattern of global environmental governance.</p> <p> The three leaders agreed to support COVAX, promote the healthy, safe, and orderly personnel exchanges, safeguard the smooth and stable industrial chain and promote the international economic and trade cooperation return to normalcy at an early date.</p> <p> They also support the development of energy supply in developing countries in an efficient, clean, and diversified direction.</p> <div style="page-break-after: always;"> <span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2021/0417/FOREIGN202104170916000488206127688.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 491px;" /></p> <p> Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a video summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Beijing, capital of China, April 16, 2021.

As we speak, many children on this planet are subjected to the horror of armed conflicts," Xi noted in the speech.</p> <p> Indeed, for quite some time, people in Syria, Libya, Afghanistan and other countries in turmoil have been suffering from unimaginable violence and indignities. Stigmatization, xenophobia, racism and discrimination as well as hate speech have also been running wild in many parts of the world.</p> <p> Dima al-Kaed, a Syrian citizen, told Xinhua she has lost both her parents during the war. "I once dreamed of changing the world, but the war has changed my dream," she said, holding a photo of herself taken when she graduated from the University of Damascus years ago.</p> <p> Faiz Ahmed, an Afghan citizen living in the city of Kabul who is about to reach his 50s, said he has spent almost his whole life in an environment of war and violence. "I have not seen a single day of peace in my homeland. I hope that my country could achieve lasting peace and stability as soon as possible, and I pray to experience such a day."</p> <p> "Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed," Xi stressed on the importance of the idea of peace in his speech, quoting the preamble to the Constitution of UNESCO as saying.</p> <p> To keep war as far away as possible from mankind, Xi has provided the answer -- to "step up inter-civilization activities in education, science, technology and culture across border, time and space to spread the seeds of the idea of peace far and wide so that they will sprout, take root and grow in the hearts and minds of the world's people, and provide the planet we share with more and more forests of peace."</p> <p> These are not empty talks. In fact, guided by Xi's wisdom on peace, which has been revealed time and again through his remarks on various occasions, China has been making great contributions to regional and global stability, development and prosperity.</p> <p> China is now the largest contributor of personnel to United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Moreover, the country has played a constructive role in addressing global issues such as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the conflicts in the Middle East.</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/BIG/20210329/0/4669121046557598168.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Anita Kiki Gebe, deputy joint special representative of the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), awards UN peace medal to a soldier of the 2nd China Medium Utility Helicopter Unit (CMUHU02) in El-Fashir, Sudan, July 17, 2019. (Xinhua)</em></p> <p> China always "works to resolve conflicts with peaceful methods and giving priority to the logic of humanity and the logic of the international law over the logic of force and hegemony," said Muhammad Zahra, a Syrian expert on China affairs.</p> <p> The idea of peace espoused by Xi "does resonate very well with the fundamental principles of harmonious coexistence between people," said Cavince Adhere, an international relations researcher in Kenya. "We have seen this to be the basis of Chinese engagement both at home and abroad."</p> <p> <strong>BROADER MIND</strong></p> <p> "We need a mind that is broader than the sky as we approach different civilizations ... we should seek wisdom and nourishment from various civilizations to provide support and consolation for people's mind, and work together to tackle the challenges facing mankind," Xi said seven years ago.</p> <p> His remarks still bear profound significance now, as the world has yet to walk out of the severe global public health crisis -- diversity will support and enrich the global efforts against COVID-19.</p> <p> While COVID-19 vaccines must be a global public good, accessible and affordable for all, as emphasized by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in February, some Western countries have stockpiled large quantities of vaccines against the virus, creating stark inequity between the rich and the poor.</p> <p> According to a report by The New York Times on Monday, residents of wealthy and middle-income countries have received about 90 percent of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered so far.</p> <p> Against such a backdrop, China, as a responsible major country with a broader mind to help humanity prevail against the common enemy, has not only delivered medical supplies and sent expert teams to places in need at the early stage of the fight, but also made an all-out effort to promote the fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.</p> <p> So far, China has provided vaccine assistance to 80 countries in need, and is exporting vaccines to 47 countries. It has also decided to provide 10 million vaccine doses to the multilateral vaccine alliance COVAX to meet the urgent needs of developing countries, and to donate vaccines to UN peacekeepers.</p> <p> As the second batch of the Sinovac vaccines donated by China arrived in the Philippines on Wednesday, Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque said "the arrival of these vaccines could not have occurred at a more opportune time considering the continued rise in cases."</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/BIG/20210329/45/2461444241785078757.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>The second batch of the Sinovac vaccines donated by China arrive in Manila, the Philippines, on March 24, 2021. (Xinhua/Rouelle Umali)</em></p> <p> "China the lion has awakened, but it is a peaceful, amicable and civilized lion," Xi said in 2014 at a gathering marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic relations, stressing that the Chinese dream is about pursuing peace, questing for happiness, and contributing to the common good of the world.</p> <p> "As the (Chinese) vaccines were released and aided, this becomes the biggest proof of China's sincerity of intentions and its willingness to lend a helping hand and reaching out to everyone who needs it," Ahmed Bahaa El-Din Shaaban, secretary-general of the Egyptian Socialist Party, told Xinhua.</p> <p> What China is doing is "beyond nationalism," said Farhat Asif, president of the Islamabad-based Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies. "It's not for the one nation, and it's (for) a community of the shared future. When you're saving somebody, when you're saving a life, it's also saving humanity."</p> <p> <strong>HARMONY WITHOUT UNIFORMITY</strong></p> <p> "Civilizations have become richer and more colorful with exchanges and mutual learning. Such exchanges and mutual learning form an important drive for human progress and global peace and development," noted Xi in 2014, proposing to the world China's understanding of harmony, which is deeply rooted in the spirit of the Chinese people.</p> <p> In today's uncertain world, where protectionism, unilateralism and the so-called "clash of civilizations" are on the rise, and where some Western countries are forming cliques, turning back the wheel of history, inciting division along ideological lines, or instigating confrontation between different groups, Xi's remarks have become even more thought-provoking.</p> <p> "To meet our common challenges and create a better future for all, we look to culture and civilization to play their role, which is as important as the role played by economy, science and technology," Xi said in 2019 at the opening ceremony of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations.</p> <p> Through a series of global events, and within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS that groups emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the Belt and Road Initiative, and other organizations, Xi has continuously stressed the wisdom of "harmony without uniformity," which the Chinese have come to appreciate. Over the past seven years, during his trips to other countries, the Chinese president has offered to the world the Chinese idea of upholding inclusiveness.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2021/0329/FOREIGN202103290829000552461982122.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 675px;" /></p> <p> <em>Chinese engineers discuss solutions at the construction site of a joint Argentina-China hydropower megaproject in southern Argentina, April 22, 2020.

(China Gezhouba Group Corporation/Handout via Xinhua)</em></p> <p> China has initiated an important dialogue among civilizations, sharing with other countries the ideas that the only way of peaceful coexistence is through understanding, through communication to resolve all differences, said Asif, adding this is "the essence of China's peaceful scene at the global level."</p> <p> "On international exchanges as an avenue of cementing peace and development across the world, China has also played a very key role," said Adhere.</p> <p> For example, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has become a key platform to promote multi-civilizational exchanges between China and African countries, he said, adding it is only through these exchanges that people can have mutual understanding.</p> <p> "This decision by China to promote civilizational exchanges is a key component. It speaks to the aspiration of the UN, the multilateral settings, and it's something that eventually leaves every human being better," he said.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> FUZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Yu Guangqing, former Party chief of a village in east China's Fujian Province, is proud of himself for helping turn local snacks into a household name across the country.</p> <p> Back in the early 1990s, inspired by some villagers who made big profits by peddling local cuisine in big cities, Yu, from Yubang Village, Shaxian District in the city of Sanming, tried to talk the whole village into following in their footsteps.</p> <p> Now, over 90 percent of the village's laboring population is in the snack business in cities across the country, satisfying customers with Shaxian delicacies including peanut butter noodles, wontons filled with juicy meat, fried rice noodles and meat soup.</p> <p> During an inspection tour in Fujian Province from Monday to Thursday, President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited the village, where he underlined that the key to rural vitalization lies in developing industries that suit local conditions and benefit local people.</p> <p> Yubang is now hailed as the origin of the Shaxian Delicacies eateries that have risen to popularity across the country.</p> <p> With great variety, widely accepted flavors and affordable prices, Shaxian Delicacies has emerged as one of the pillar industries in Shaxian.</p> <p> Xi has highlighted the important role that local snacks and similar industries can play in driving rural development.</p> <p> In a visit to Shaxian in March 1999, Xi, then deputy Party chief of Fujian, said the secret to the success of Shaxian Delicacies was finding a niche market and a low-margin but high-volume business model, and called for expanding the snack industry.</p> <p> The next year, Xi revisited Shaxian, urging efforts to strengthen the tertiary sector with its pillar snack industry as a new driver of economic growth.</p> <p> "His words helped me see the prospects in making Shaxian eateries into a restaurant chain like McDonald's and KFC, so I gathered my courage to open an outlet outside my hometown that December," said Lin Yingjiang, a Shaxian native.</p> <p> In the following years, many locals like Lin traveled afar to populate Shaxian Delicacies franchises throughout China and even abroad.</p> <p> To promote the snack industry, Shaxian, previously a county, has drawn up more than 40 documents, granted 532 million yuan (about 81.56 million U.S. dollars) in loans for start-ups and provided more than 23,000 free training courses in management and production skills over the past two decades.</p> <p> Inspired by Xi's instruction, Shaxian has found new success through industrial upgrades in recent years.</p> <p> Once a scattering of husband-and-wife eateries, Shaxian Delicacies is now a food chain with around 88,000 storefronts worldwide with more than 300,000 employees, generating a yearly turnover of nearly 50 billion yuan.</p> <p> The booming snack industry has helped increase Shaxian's rural per capita annual income from 2,805 yuan in 1997 to 21,855 yuan in 2020.</p> <p> It has also helped lift more than 200,000 people in Shaxian and its adjacent areas out of poverty, amid the country's vigorous anti-poverty efforts that have seen nearly 100 million rural residents shake off poverty over the past eight years.</p> <p> To consolidate poverty alleviation outcomes and promote rural vitalization, China plans to support the formerly impoverished rural areas in developing and expanding industries featuring local characteristics.</p> <p> Xi has attached great importance to the development of industries that fit local conditions in rural vitalization.</p> <p> During his Fujian trip, he also visited a tea farm in Wuyishan City. "In the past, the tea industry was a pillar in your fight against poverty, and it should become a pillar industry of rural vitalization in the future," Xi said.</p> <p> During an inspection trip to the southwestern Guizhou Province in February this year, Xi visited a Miao embroidery workshop and applauded its role in promoting rural vitalization.</p> <p> In May 2020, when inspecting the northern Shanxi Province, Xi visited an organic daylily farm and said the daylily industry can become a big industry with great prospects.</p> <p> With vast greenery and good ecological environment, Sanming's eco-tourism industry has maintained strong momentum. Last year, the city's eco-tourism industry alone generated a total revenue of 75 billion yuan.</p> <p> In Guifeng, an 800-year-old village in Sanming known for its well-preserved ancient buildings, around 180,000 tourists have visited the village each year in the recent period.</p> <p> "The scenery in my hometown is really beautiful," said 33-year-old villager Cai Wenjiang, a former migrant worker who has returned home and started a homestay business. "I hope more people will come and enjoy its beauty."</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> FUZHOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tucked away in the tranquil ravines of the Wuyi Mountains in east China's Fujian Province, Yang Wenchun's tea farm is colored by a sea of golden rapeseed flowers as swarms of bees and butterflies hop from one flower to the next.</p> <p> The flowers, which blossom among lines of tea bushes, were not planted for their aesthetic appeal, nor for their oil-yielding seeds, but as a source of green manure and natural insect repellent, said Yang, owner of the 21-hectare tea farm.</p> <p> The ecological tea farm is part of the polyculture project of Liao Hong, an agronomist at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University and a sci-tech expert sent to spearhead innovation in rural areas by the local government. Liao has provided technical support for the tea farm since 2018. Her team has trained thousands of agricultural technicians and farmers in different places in Fujian.</p> <p> President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected Yang's tea farm on Monday.</p> <p> Xi was delighted to learn that the quality of tea has improved and farmers' incomes have increased as ecologically friendly methods are used in the farm over the years under the guidance of technical professionals.</p> <p> "We should sum up the experience and system of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas, and continue to improve, consolidate and adhere to it," said Xi.</p> <p> China's mechanism of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas aims to popularize agricultural science and technology, spearhead sci-tech innovation and entrepreneurship there, and help lead villages out of poverty and promote rural vitalization.</p> <p> The practice was initiated in 1999 when the local government in the city of Nanping, Fujian, sought to upgrade its unproductive rural economy.</p> <p> For a start, a total of 225 sci-tech experts were sent to the rural areas of Nanping to offer guidance for farmers in their daily work.</p> <p> In 2002, Xi, then governor of Fujian Province, appreciated the measure of Nanping in an article, saying it was a useful exploration in innovating rural work. In the same year, the measure of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas was piloted in several other provinces and regions. It was promoted nationwide in 2009 and has gained bigger institutional support from the central authorities since 2012.</p> <p> In his important instructions made on the 20th anniversary of the system of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas in 2019, President Xi encouraged sci-tech experts working in rural areas to uphold their original aspiration and make new and greater contributions to poverty alleviation and rural vitalization.</p> <p> As a grape growing expert in the agricultural bureau of Nanping, Xie Fuxin used to ride a bicycle to grape greenhouses in the countryside of Nanping to offer technical instruction, carrying a bag that was loaded with a lunchbox and shears to prune and graft vines.</p> <p> Xie was nicknamed the "grape wizard" by local farmers, for he was adept at explaining sophisticated terms in simple language, and more importantly, his growing techniques were quite effective.</p> <p> Over the past 20 years, Xie has trained over 10,000 grape farmers and helped expand the planting acreage of the fruit to over 4,200 hectares across Nanping, which generates 600 million yuan (about 92 million U.S. dollars) every year and has lifted thousands of local farmers out of poverty.</p> <p> China has sent nearly 300,000 sci-tech experts to rural areas in poverty alleviation efforts since 2012, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology.</p> <p> China has made rural vitalization a priority to promote growth in the countryside over the next five years. Initiatives in science and technology are being introduced in rural areas to promote modern agriculture.</p> <p> "I am proud that my work has helped many farmers increase their incomes. I just want to contribute more to farmers and the rural economy," Xie said.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Zhang Long)</em></p> <p> <strong>BETTER SUPERVISION</strong></p> <p> However, problems and risks involving the sector have also caught the attention of policymakers and regulatory authorities.</p> <p> Some large online marketplaces have done too much in tracking and collecting their users' digital footprints to push ads touting excessive consumption to those with fragile credit standing and thus lured them into the traps of unsecured consumer loans, said Dong Ximiao, a part-time researcher with the Institute for Financial Studies, Fudan University.</p> <p> "Internet platforms improve the availability of financial products but often ignore their affordability, which could cause financial risks to pile up," he added.</p> <p> Other latent risks ranging from data monopoly to deliberately circumventing regulation also trigger concerns. As current regulation is sector-specific, there exist certain regulatory gaps and loopholes. Supervision against cross-market, cross-sector and cross-domain financial risks needs to be strengthened, Dong said.</p> <p> The meeting made it clear that all financial activities involving platform enterprises must be put under financial supervision to rectify the situation, while regulators need to consolidate their oversight capability under an optimized supervision framework.</p> <p> It also reiterated the need to promote fair competition, oppose monopoly and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital as well as the need to strengthen the protection of the rights of all market entities involved in the platform economy and safeguard users' rights and interests in data and privacy.</p> <p> The meeting had pointed out the direction for the healthy development of the platform economy, which was pursuing development with regulation optimized side by side, Zhang Yansheng said.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2021/0319/FOREIGN202103190811000442488782988.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 601px;" /></p> <p> <em>Workers weld at a workshop of an automobile manufacturing enterprise in Qingzhou City, east China's Shandong Province, Feb. 28, 2021. (Photo by Wang Jilin/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> Another takeaway of the meeting, as analysts noted, is that the platform economy has been tasked with a mission to make contributions to high-quality economic development and improve the quality of life as the country ushers in its 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025).</p> <p> In this regard, industrial internet platforms are encouraged to facilitate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries and foster the development of advanced manufacturing, while platform enterprises in the consumer sector will be supported to tap the country's consumption power and provide more quality products and services, the meeting noted.</p> <p> The meeting also emphasized the need to boost opening-up and cooperation, foster a dynamic and innovative institutional environment, and strengthen international technical exchanges and research collaboration.</p> <p> "More should be done to improve the weak links, create an environment for innovation, resolve prominent problems, and promote the regulated, healthy and sustainable development of the platform economy," Xi said.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo by Xie Huiqiang/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Almost half a year after Chinese President Xi Jinping's pledge to make the country carbon-neutral before 2060, the roadmap to achieve the goal is getting clearer under Xi's push as authorities and industries scale up their green efforts.</p> <p> China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, Xi announced at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly via video in September last year.</p> <p> Since then, vigorous policies have been rolled out on top of the already hefty input in green development. At a meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs on Monday, Xi called for incorporating the peaking of carbon emissions and carbon neutrality into the overall layout of building an ecological civilization.</p> <p> "Peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality is a tough battle, it is also a major test of the party's capabilities in governing the country," the meeting stressed.</p> <p> While China's economic rise over the past decades was largely powered by coal, the country, now among the world's biggest investors in green energy, is increasing pace to shift to other renewables including wind and solar.</p> <p> Starting in February, China implemented a set of interim rules for the management of carbon-emissions trading designed to drive down the emissions of big power users.</p> <p> Under the scheme, firms that exceed the emission caps can buy emission quotas from others with a lower carbon footprint.</p> <p> A total of 2,225 power firms are included in the project. More fields, such as the steel and aluminum production sectors, will be included in future carbon trading.</p> <p> The campaign for green energy also enabled the public to embrace a more eco-friendly lifestyle, as was shown by the country's booming sales of new energy vehicles.</p> <p> On the back of the united efforts, the share of clean energy consumption in the country has risen from 19.1 percent in 2016 to 24.3 percent in 2020, data by the National Bureau of Statistics showed.</p> <p> While addressing the Climate Ambition Summit via video link in December last year, Xi announced that by 2030, China aims to lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 percent.</p> <p> To move toward the goal, energy consumption per unit of GDP and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2021 will be reduced by 13.5 percent and 18 percent, respectively, according to this year's government work report, which also promised to draw up an action plan for peaking carbon emissions before 2030.</p> <p> While expanding the use of green energy, bringing down carbon emissions to net zero, which means achieving a balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon, will require the development of new technologies to capture and store emissions.</p> <p> Monday's meeting also called for efforts to push forward major breakthroughs in green and low-carbon technologies and accelerate the promotion and application of such technologies for reducing pollution and carbon emissions.</p> <p> It has underscored improvements in policies on fiscal taxation, prices, finance, land and government procurement that are conducive to green and low-carbon development.</p> <p> "To peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality is an extensive and profound systemic reform for the economy and society," Xi noted at Monday's meeting.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Wu Gang)</em></p> <p> Due to prominent problems such as over-exploitation of mineral resources, illegal construction and operation of hydropower facilities and excessive emissions by local enterprises, the ecological environment of the Qilian Mountains suffered serious damage for a period of time, which aroused high attention from the central authorities.</p> <p> Xi made important instructions several times on tackling the long-standing environmental violations in the Qilian Mountains, demanding resolute rectifications. In 2017, the central authorities punished senior officials of Gansu for their failure to undertake their duties.</p> <p> He inspected the ecological restoration and protection work during an inspection tour in Gansu in 2019.</p> <p> Qinghai has given priority to ecological protection and green development to better protect the ecology of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and meet people's aspirations for a better life.</p> <p> The Qilian Mountains National Park covers 50,200 square km -- 34,400 square km in Gansu and 15,800 square km in Qinghai. It is home to many rare animal species, including snow leopards, wild donkeys and blue sheep.</p> <p> After recent years of intensive restoration efforts, the populations of snow leopards, Tibetan wild donkeys, white-lipped deer and alpine musk deer have been expanding as the quality of their habitats was significantly improved.</p> <p> In Namse township of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai, where the Lancang River flows through, 45 snow leopards have been spotted, and the township is thus dubbed as the "hometown" of snow leopards due to the frequent sightings of the big cat species.</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/BIG/20210316/21/174918300571925361.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Infrared photo taken on Jan. 17, 2019 shows a snow leopard in the Qilian Mountains National Park in northwest China's Qinghai Province. (Xinhua)</em></p> <p> The township has piloted a franchise business model for tourism, training some herdsmen to serve as ecological guides to host visitors from around the world.</p> <p> Forty-five percent of the franchise business revenue goes to the herdsmen, another 45 percent to the village and the remaining 10 percent to an ecological protection fund. The guides can earn some 10,000 yuan (about 1,540 U.S. dollars) a year.</p> <p> Zhoima, a Tibetan woman living in Babao Township of Qilian County, Qinghai, recalled that the county, which is rich in mineral resources, used to be clustered with asbestos factories.</p> <p> "The factories greatly affected the herders' lives," she said. "Whenever they operated, grey dust covered the whole pasture. When the sheep were slaughtered, asbestos residue was found in their intestines."</p> <p> Since 2017, Qilian county, which is part of the Qilian Mountains National Park, has spent 613 million yuan on the ecological restoration project to bring back the original look of the mountains.</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/BIG/20210316/40/7747062501717959148.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Aerial photo taken on June 22, 2019 shows a forest farm in Qilian County of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, northwest China's Qinghai Province.

We will stick to the people-centered development concept, make Qinghai more beautiful and bring more benefits to the people," said Liu Tao, vice governor of Qinghai.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Market expectations and forecasts by major international organizations point to higher growth.

No doubt, the China locomotive will continue to inject impetus to the pandemic-hit global economy.</p> <p> China's integration into the world showed that there is no reason for the country to shut its doors. It is crystal clear that openness leads to prosperity, while closed doors invite obscurity.</p> <p> This year marks the 20th anniversary of China's accession to the World Trade Organization. China has continuously contributed to the process of globalization and achieved win-win results alongside the rest of the world. Over the past two decades, the country's average annual contribution to world economic growth has neared 30 percent, while its overall tariff level has dropped from 15.3 percent to below 7.5 percent.</p> <p> At this historic development juncture and the starting point of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), China's economy has embarked on a new journey with three major driving forces: scientific and technological innovation, the expansion of domestic demand, and reform and opening-up, which will help further unleash the vitality of the country's huge market.</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="http://www.people.com.cn/mediafile/pic/BIG/20210311/42/2283785878941886198.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Delegates from China and Switzerland sign an agreement at the booth of STOR-H TECHNOLOGIES SA from Switzerland during the third China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, east China, Nov. 6, 2020.(Xinhua/Fang Zhe)</em></p> <p> China will promote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, and steadily promote the opening-up of financial sectors including banking, securities, insurance and futures, according to the draft outline of the new five-year plan.</p> <p> In addition to opportunities, opening-up also brings new challenges.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's "dual circulation" development paradigm, a major strategy championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and featuring domestic and overseas markets reinforcing each other with the domestic market as the mainstay, is under the spotlight during the country's ongoing annual "two sessions."</p> <p> The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), a draft outline of which has been submitted to the country's top legislature and political advisory body for deliberation and discussion, will further clarify how China will implement the "dual circulation" strategy and achieve high-quality development.</p> <p> Unleashing domestic demand is crucial to driving China's growth, but this new development paradigm does not mean China will backpedal on its opening-up, officials and experts have said.</p> <p> <strong>STRATEGIC DECISION</strong></p> <p> In May 2020, the leadership of the Communist Party of China made a strategic decision to foster a new development pattern where domestic and foreign markets can boost each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay.</p> <p> "Making the domestic market the mainstay does not mean we are developing our economy with the door closed," Xi told a symposium of entrepreneurs in July last year. By giving full play to the potential of the domestic market, both domestic and foreign markets can be better connected and utilized to realize robust and sustainable development, he said.</p> <p> China will follow the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm, and pursue high-quality development by staying committed to deepening reform and opening wider to the world, Xi said when delivering a speech via video at the third Paris Peace Forum in 2020.</p> <p> He stressed that China will also work with the rest of the international community to keep the global industrial and supply chains stable and to foster an open world economy.</p> <p> China on Friday unveiled a draft blueprint for economic and social development over the next five years and clarified the long-range objectives through the year 2035, setting policy priorities for a new development stage that is crucial for the country to achieve socialist modernization.</p> <p> The draft outline includes comprehensive and targeted measures echoing China's new development philosophy, said Xin Ming, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance).</p> <p> <strong>PARALLEL EMPHASIS</strong></p> <p> Jochen Goller, chief of BMW Group Region China, said China's new development pattern of "dual circulation" is an effective strategy customized to the strength of the Chinese domestic market.</p> <p> "'Dual circulation' puts a parallel emphasis both on domestic and international circulation. A high-level opening up certainly serves this end, brings win-win outcomes both for Chinese and multinational companies," he noted.</p> <p> Alexander Lomanov, deputy director at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said the transition to the "dual circulation" model is an important stage in the development of China's economic policy.</p> <p> "It has its own internal logic and the Chinese leadership has stressed the importance of domestic demand for years," he noted.</p> <p> <strong>WIN-WIN CHOICE</strong></p> <p> Dual circulation is seen as a strategic and win-win choice for China to reshape its international cooperation and new competitive edge, said Justin Yifu Lin, former World Bank chief economist and honorary dean of the National School of Development at Peking University.</p> <p> "China's economy has been deeply integrated into the global economy. As China enters the new stage of development, its ties with the world economy will get even closer," said Ji Zhiye, former head of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations who is also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.</p> <p> Ji said the international capitals are optimistic about the Chinese market thanks to the country's business environment and economic resilience.</p> <p> Zarko Obradovic, member of the Serbian parliament and president of the Friendship Group with China, said China's new development pattern featuring "dual circulation" would help the country take advantage of the development of the domestic market and make China an ideal economic partner.</p> <p> Boga Thura Manatsha, senior lecturer at the Department of History of University of Botswana, said that China needs the world for its economy to continue growing and the global economy also needs China to make a sustained comeback.</p> <p> "It is basically a win-win scenario," he said, noting that as the whole world, especially developing countries, has been hit hard by COVID-19, China has a critical role to play in reviving the world economy.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>
