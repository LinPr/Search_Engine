	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded U.S.-ASEAN summit will not draw regional countries closer to the U.S. side, and the U.S. attempt to court support among ASEAN in pursuit of its geopolitical interests is unlikely to gain traction, experts have said.</p> <p> U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.</p> <p> U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL</p> <p> Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.</p> <p> Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.</p> <p> "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."</p> <p> The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."</p> <p> Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.</p> <p> Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."</p> <p> Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.</p> <p> Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.</p> <p> "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.</p> <p> As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.</p> <p> "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.</p> <p> "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.</p> <p> From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.</p> <p> A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p> This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."</p> <p> ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE</p> <p> Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.</p> <p> With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.</p> <p> The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.</p> <p> "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."</p> <p> The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.</p> <p> Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.</p> <p> "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.</p> <p> Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.</p> <p> "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.</p> <p> "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.</p> <p> VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN</p> <p> It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.</p> <p> Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.</p> <p> "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.</p> <p> Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."</p> <p> "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been exploiting democracy, human rights and aid as tools and weapons to incite division around the world and meddle in other countries' internal affairs, say political experts.</p> <p> "To influence domestic policies in recipient countries ... the U.S. has provided assistance to serve its goals and achieve its interests," Ayman Okeil, general manager of the Cairo-based Maat for Peace, Development, and Human Rights, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p> <p> THE NED AS A PROXY</p> <p> Among all the proxies Washington uses to serve its political agenda in other countries, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was founded in 1983 as a bipartisan, non-profit institution by the U.S. government, is one of the most active.</p> <p> Nominally a non-governmental organization that provides support for democracy abroad, the NED in fact relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the U.S. Congress, and takes orders from the U.S. government.</p> <p> Okeil described the NED as one of Washington's "soldiers" for interfering in other countries' decision-making process.</p> <p> The NED has worked as a substitute for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cultivating pro-U.S. opposition activists for subverting lawful governments and provoking uprisings in the Arab countries under the pretext of promoting democracy, he said.</p> <p> According to Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, the NED was founded as a tool for projecting political influence in different sovereign states that the U.S. government has labeled as "non-democratic, totalitarian, authoritarian and anti-American."</p> <p> The NED supported opposition groups in other countries, which were trained to represent Washington's interest, rather than the vital interests of their own nations and states, Rawashdeh pointed out.</p> <p> Echoing Rawashdeh's point, Okeil said that the NED has spent millions of U.S. dollars to support political parties, labor unions, dissident movements, and media in dozens of countries.</p> <p> The organization has been employed as the "mastermind" behind separatist riots, color revolutions, and political crises around the world, with the aim of toppling legitimate governments and creating U.S. puppets in targeted countries, said Ahmad Ashqar, a Syrian journalist and political expert.</p> <p> The NED makes sure that nations across the globe do what the United States wants them to do and in no way feel confident and capable of pursuing their own political/ideological agendas, Rawashdeh said. "And this is also what the U.S. foreign policy is doing for decades."</p> <p> A NEW TYPE OF IMPERIALISM</p> <p> The United States, unfortunately, has created a new type of imperialism, by occupying foreign countries with money and forces and interfering in their choice of leaders and party compositions, Okeil told Xinhua.</p> <p> Unlike the funds that came from some countries like China, which help improve health, education and development sectors, the U.S. economic aid is always with conditions attached, he noted</p> <p> Okeil's words are not groundless. According to a study by the American University in Cairo in November 2021, the NED has allocated more than 606 million dollars in "democracy assistance" to Egypt in the period between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the U.S. government provided 415 million dollars in economic assistance to Egypt, which includes 55 million dollars to support programs for promoting democracy.</p> <p> However, as Tariq Fahmy, a political science professor at the Cairo University, noted, the U.S. mode of democracy has not been successful in the Middle East, and it contradicts many countries' unique conditions.</p> <p> "We all saw the disgraceful role in provoking the Arab Spring via funding the protesters" under the cover of democracy and human rights, Fahmy said, explaining that such kind of imposed democracy couldn't breed stability.</p> <p> After the Arab Spring, many people in the Middle East have started to see the real objectives behind the U.S. aid when knowing that Washington had a role in inciting the Arab Spring uprisings via supporting, training and funding young protesters, Okeil noted.</p> <p> The U.S. model of democracy is not suitable for the world, and based on that model, the U.S. policies led to real crimes, Fahmy said.</p> <p> It's a fact that the United States has distorted the positive meaning of democracy and emptied such a notion of anything useful and beneficial for other countries, Ashqar argued.</p> <p> "We have seen several examples like in Syria, where the United States used democracy as a pretext to support separatist forces and radical ones to destabilize the legitimate government," he said. "The U.S. presence in Syria has achieved all but the so-called democracy."</p> <p> "Under the pretext of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy, the U.S. has stolen key areas in Syria rich with oil and gas, do you call that democracy?" asked the Syrian journalist.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Its disrespect for ASEAN members concerning scheduling issues despite its pledge of "enduring commitment" has sparked a wave of complaints among ASEAN members, resulting in a postponement of the summit from late March to May.</p> <p> Cambodian Minister attached to the Prime Minister Kao Kim Hourn said before the summit that if Washington was serious about improving its ties with ASEAN, it should have arranged bilateral meetings between the United States and ASEAN countries. ASEAN leaders "should be treated with respect and equality," he noted.</p> <p> The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements. The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.</p> <p> Many sober minds in ASEAN have seen through this duplicity and bullying. Indonesia and Malaysia warned that AUKUS could lead to a major arms race in the region. A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="/mediafile/pic/BIG/20220514/71/5892171399547127135.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on March 24, 2022 shows the U.S. national flag (R) on the U.S. Embassy building in Moscow, Russia. (Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)</em></p> <p> Meanwhile, the White House will attempt in vain during this summit to talk ASEAN into imposing sanctions against Russia. Ever since the escalation of the current Ukraine crisis, Washington has been trying to exert pressure on ASEAN to take sides, but most of ASEAN members did not follow suit.</p> <p> On April 7, six of the 10-member bloc abstained from voting in favor of a resolution to remove Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and two voted against it. Long adhering to an independent foreign policy, ASEAN members have urged solving the crisis through negotiation and dialogue.</p> <p> Moreover, some ASEAN members have been well aware of Washington's unspoken calculations to turn bloody sufferings of others into golden opportunities for profits in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during his visit to China in early April, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said he appreciates China's objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, that "Asian countries should maintain peace and stability in the region, jointly resist unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law, and prevent attempts to create tensions and replicate crises in the region."</p> <p> Playing small clique politics and forcing others to take sides -- Washington's old tricks to gain geopolitical interests -- work against ASEAN's will to uphold regional peace and stability and to realize sustainable economic development. Launching trade wars and breaking pacts -- Washington's classical acts of unilateralism -- severely disrupt normal trade exchanges and supply chains in the region and deal a heavy blow to ASEAN's economy. All those wrongdoings have tarnished Washington's credit and influence as the world's sole superpower, and driven it further apart from ASEAN members.</p> <p> The long arc of history teaches each and every country that acting without scruples almost always results in the reverse of what one desires. It is time for Washington to learn this lesson, abandon its old dream of Cold War hegemony, uphold an open and inclusive mindset, and play its due role in maintaining regional and global peace, stability and development.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Chen Jianli)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has exerted downward pressure on the Chinese economy. With an array of pro-growth policies to produce their intended effects, the risk is manageable and the sound fundamentals of the world's second-largest economy in the medium-to-long term will not change.</p> <p> To cope with the pandemic, China has applied a stringent dynamic zero-COVID policy. As the pandemic is still raging across the world and coronavirus continues to mutate, there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning how the situation will develop. The country has warned against any slackening in its efforts to control the virus.</p> <p> China's stance has been firm and clear -- unswervingly adhering to the dynamic zero-COVID policy while shoring up the economy and ensuring people's lives are affected as little as possible.</p> <p> Giving proper consideration to all these aspects is a difficult task. The earnest implementation of this policy is a major test for all regions and departments.</p> <p> A string of pro-growth policies is in the pipeline. China has already adopted multi-pronged fiscal measures in tax and fee cuts, public budget expenditure and bond issuance to stabilize the economy and ensure its people's wellbeing.</p> <p> Moreover, China has accelerated the establishment of a unified domestic market, comprehensively strengthened infrastructure construction, and deepened reform and opening-up across the board.</p> <p> The State Council and relevant departments are also rolling out detailed policies and measures to help industries, individually owned businesses and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises hit hard by the pandemic, and to stabilize market entities.</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="/mediafile/pic/BIG/20220514/78/15009916851255006974.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Photo shows staff members work in a workshop at Songz Automobile Air Conditioning Co.

They have rich experience in responding to downward pressure on the economy and will further strengthen regulatory control, and will do so when the time is right.</p> <p> The Chinese economy is off to a steady start this year, with its GDP up 4.8 percent year on year in the first three months. Despite the downward pressure, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, including its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. After pro-growth policies gradually produce their intended effects, China's economic performance will improve.</p> <p> By contributing approximately 30 percent to world economic growth, the Chinese economy is the largest engine driving global economic growth. The Chinese economy is at a critical moment in overcoming its difficulties. It is only by remaining confident and rising to the challenges that China can turn adverse situations into opportunities, embrace its bright prospects, continue to inject dynamism into the stability and recovery of the global economy and bring broader market opportunities for all countries.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Graphic: Zero-sum or zero-carbon/People's Daily Online)</span></p> <p> The Glasgow climate summit held last year was largely viewed as a chance for redemption. After the grim outcome of the (2°C) mitigation target set at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, humanity's "last chance" to save the planet, nations were nudged to give climate cooperation another shot. Few world leaders are more zealous and vocal on the matter than US president Joe Biden, who has proposed a portfolio of ambitious goals and called for joint collaboration between major players and, in particular, the US and China.</p> <p> Then, last February, in a surprise move, the Biden administration announced that it would extend the Trump-era Section 201 tariffs slapped on solar panels, in a bid to "continue facilitating positive adjustment to competition" from imported photovoltaic cells. Though the administration did offer some clues on the "positive adjustment," almost four years after the tariffs were levied, experts argued that America's solar industry remained nascent in its development despite full-blown trade barriers and that the decision came at an emissions cost.</p> <p> In an opinion essay published earlier this month in <em>The Hill</em>, John Paul Helveston, an American researcher, debated that tariffs won't help the US build a "robust solar industry." He contended that China's tremendous R&amp;D efforts on photovoltaic (PV) innovations, which helped slash the prices of most PV panels from $2,000 per kilowatt to just $300 per kilowatt, cannot be simply duplicated. It is highly unlikely that another nation will be able to "replicate China's skills in the time frame needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change," he cited an article he co-wrote in <em>Science </em>back in 2019, adding, "Rather than continuing the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese solar panels, the US and others should be partnering with Chinese firms to obtain low-cost technologies and components to increase domestic deployment of renewables as fast as possible to meet the narrow window left to decarbonize."</p> <p> Low-cost solar technologies and components, however, have been the very items subject to Washington's ongoing investigation.</p> <p> The New York Times reported on April 29 that, amidst an investigation by the US Commerce Department targeting Chinese-made PV parts, the US solar industry has been "frozen," with over 300 solar projects being "canceled or delayed." American energy enterprises, big and small, have all been dragged into the quagmire of self-censorship over Chinese solar parts. "The investigation is having a catastrophic negative impact on the renewable energy sector and driving up electricity prices. With each day the tariff investigation continues, the country is falling further behind in achieving our climate goals," said Nick Bullinger, COO of a Chicago-based solar company, in an interview that appeared in the <em>Times </em>article.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0512/FOREIGN202205121524000530389177826.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>U.S. President Joe Biden (R) speaks during an event, at the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, on May 9, 2022. Biden said that the administration is "discussing" whether to drop hiked tariffs on Chinese products. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> From the perspective of environmental benefits or from the standpoint of economic interests, Washington's 4-year-long-and-counting solar clampdown is cost-ineffective, as it collides with even Biden's own climate agenda.</p> <p> US president Joe Biden attended the Glasgow summit with high hopes—100% renewable energy by 2035; but the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), an NGO, estimated that America's current production capacity only makes up 15% of its demand. Neither will taxing and purging Chinese solar panels or PV parts help "bring jobs back home," since even with heavy tariffs the US remains heavily dependent on imported PV products.</p> <p> Besides, the volume of jobs generated by solar installations in the US is ten times larger than the manufacturing jobs created by the nation's entire solar sector, according to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). As a letter sent to President Biden last January by eight American senators (from both parties) stated, the Section 201 tariffs had "led to the loss of more than 62,000 American clean energy jobs and 10.5 gigawatts of foregone solar deployment." It is difficult then to tell who the tariffs and investigation are designed to punish: overseas solar producers or the American labor force?</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0512/FOREIGN202205121527000336131916818.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> But it's not hard to detect what formula is being applied in America's zero-carbon solution—its default zero-sum fixation. After all, the one-nation's-gain-representing-another's-loss mindset takes various shapes in the China-US relations from Washington's point of view.</p> <p> On the global stage, it is reflected in Washington's unreasonable belief that China's global presence, such as donating COVID-19 vaccines to developing nations, will undermine the superpower's global influence.</p> <p> In the economic sphere, it is manifested in America's obsession with punitive tariffs, which it deems will help reverse trade deficits and boost domestic industry, even though the burden will ultimately be shifted towards American consumers in the form of rising prices.</p> <p> In the technological and academic realms, it is showcased in America's year-long crackdown on Chinese tech companies and its unjustified witch-hunt targeting Chinese academics and students.</p> <p> ... ...</p> <p> The aforementioned aspects of Washington's zero-sum practices are epitomized by its now-stagnant solar industry, which in turn has demonstrated why such a mindset won't work.

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded election of the sixth-term chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been widely recognized as a consolidation of the "patriots administering Hong Kong" principle and a new step toward democracy with Hong Kong characteristics.</p> <p> However, a handful of politicians from a few Western countries launched an unscrupulous smear campaign, taking this opportunity to make malicious attacks on China.</p> <p> Their obsolete tricks of creating a "trap of public opinion" and grossly interfering in China's internal affairs out of ideological bias again revealed the evil political agenda of some Western forces to make trouble in Hong Kong and contain China.</p> <p> While issuing groundless and illogical slanders against the democracy in Hong Kong, the politicians ignored the truth that there is no one-size-fits-all democratic model in the world, and a sound democracy fits the reality of a specific region and works to solve its problems.</p> <p> Over the past few months, three elections in Hong Kong -- the Election Committee election, the election of the Legislative Council, and the election of the chief executive -- have manifested the advantages of the new electoral system of the HKSAR as it ensures broad representation, political inclusiveness, balanced participation, and fair competition. The economic and social development in Hong Kong over the past year also demonstrated the obvious progressiveness and strong vitality of the new system in guaranteeing social stability, developing the economy, and improving people's well-being.</p> <p> On the other hand, the so-called "electoral democracy" in the United States and some other Western countries is money-tainted votes and political shows by nature, where the interests of political parties and interest groups outweigh the public's long-term welfare.</p> <p> By avoiding the shortcomings of the Western-style "election games," the new electoral system of Hong Kong has restored the election's role in selecting talented people with integrity and competence. Looking from this perspective, the groundless attacks by Western anti-China forces are, in nature, a shoddy democracy judging a sound one. It is a gross disrespect to the popular will of Hong Kong residents.</p> <p> While Hong Kong's new electoral system prevents the anti-China agitators from participating in the HKSAR's governance structure, the agendas of the anti-China forces in the West have experienced a massive fiasco. The recent smear campaign exposed their frustration over the failure to install proxies in Hong Kong.</p> <p> As a result of the implementation of the law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR and the improvement of its electoral system, Hong Kong has returned to the right track, with the rule of law restored, the business environment improved, and the democratic rights and freedoms enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong in accordance with the law better protected.</p> <p> This will definitely benefit the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong with significant influence globally.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- As the COVID death toll in the United States approaches 1 million, the Washington National Cathedral rang its bell 1,000 times Monday evening, once for every 1,000 people who died from the virus.</p> <p> The devastating 1-million milestone was a once-unimaginable number when the world-changing pandemic broke out more than two years ago and caused America's first known death.</p> <p> It is a permanent badge of shame on a powerful developed nation to have lost so many lives to the coronavirus, no matter how hard it tries to whitewash its botched response and move on from the public health crisis, which has also reported more than 82 million infections, the highest in the world.</p> <p> Researchers agree that if American leaders and policymakers had taken seriously early warnings from the international community and public health experts and put science over politics, hundreds of thousands of deaths and many more infections could have been avoided.</p> <p> The gut-wrenching reality is that a toxic and deadly cocktail of inaction and incompetence resulted in a human rights disaster and led to a "perfect storm" of COVID-19 swirling across the United States, shaking the logistically and morally ill-prepared nation to its core while exposing the full extent of political, economic and social maladies deeply rooted in America.</p> <p> COVID-19 has hit minority groups much harder in the United States due to their relative lack of access to health care and resources, despite more likely being essential workers required to work on the pandemic frontline.</p> <p> Consequently, African Americans experienced a downturn in life expectancy of a shocking 2.9 years, compared to 1.2 years for whites, according to a study published by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.</p> <p> "Racial inequality was baked into the recipe of the creation of the United States of America," Brookings senior fellow Rashawn Ray argued. "When crises like the COVID-19 pandemic occur, inequalities are exacerbated rather than diminished."</p> <p> The United States irresponsibly allowed infectious cases to spread to other countries and regions, while disseminating conspiracy theories and sowing divisions, severely undermining global efforts to combat COVID-19 at a time when unity and collaboration are more needed than ever.</p> <p> "With America in the lead, the world was more divided than ever. America's failure to coordinate a response was no mere sideshow," English historian and professor at Columbia University Adam Tooze wrote. "What 2020 showed, in fact, was that America's dysfunctions are the world's problem."</p> <p> The COVID-19 death rate in the United States is slowing down thanks to a broad rollout of vaccines. However, the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants has mercilessly shaped the curve of daily new deaths like a rollercoaster. Although deaths in the United States continue to fall, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising due to highly contagious Omicron subvariants.</p> <p> U.S. politicians, however, appear eager to turn the page. The White House declared a "new moment" in the COVID-19 pandemic in March, as restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus were largely lifted, with senior government officials attending high-profile indoor gatherings to demonstrate a return to normalcy, albeit still prematurely.</p> <p> Top U.S. infectious disease expert and White House chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci reportedly criticized in private the decision to hold the White House Correspondents' Dinner, after which several guests, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, tested positive for COVID-19, warning that it could be a troubling sign that many Americans no longer view COVID-19 as a serious threat.</p> <p> "We are still in the middle of a pandemic, to be sure -- there's no confusion about that," Fauci said during an interview with American news publication Foreign Policy in early May. "We hope that we don't see a major uptick as we get into the fall, but that remains to be seen. We're going to have to wait and see."</p> <p> Steven Thrasher, a Scientific American columnist and professor at Northwestern University, tweeted that the United States is "well into an era of willful, collective amnesia" and that "the shame of a million dead is too much to face -- so most won't." American epidemiologist and science communicator Tara Smith echoed the opinion, tweeting that "a million+ deaths and we already want to forget and move on."</p> <p> The White House asked for roughly 82 billion U.S. dollars for pandemic preparedness in its latest federal budget request. Still, this amount was only about one-tenth of what it sought for military operations in the new fiscal year, much to the chagrin of many. Furthermore, new COVID-19 funding remains stalled in Congress due to partisan gridlock despite repeated administration requests.</p> <p> Noting some 1 million people have died from COVID in the United States, American writer Robert Jones, Jr. tweeted. "Governments are apathetic. Politicians are indifferent. Our neighbors think they're invulnerable. Families are devastated. Children are orphaned. Stories are gone. Untold wisdom is lost."</p> <p> A senior administration official has reportedly stated that the White House is preparing for up to 100 million Americans to contract COVID-19 during a wave this fall and winter if Congress does not provide funding for vaccines and tests, referring to the median of a range of models from outside experts, as part of a renewed push to get financial assistance from a divided Capitol Hill.</p> <p> As the United States moves forward, at least 1 million people and their families and friends will be unable to do so. The blame is placed squarely on the country's failed leadership and policies, which have inscribed an agonizing chapter in its history and the memories of millions of Americans.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping had a virtual meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday. Facing complex changes in the international landscape and various challenges to world peace and development, the leaders of the two countries have been guiding bilateral relations from a high level, providing valuable momentum for greater China-Germany and China-EU cooperation.</p> <p> Today, peace and development are under threat due to rampant hegemonism and exacerbated global divisions. The onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has reignited the flames of war in Europe.</p> <p> Such an alarming increase in threats to global security and development has led to an urgent call for more stability and certainty in navigating these turbulent times.</p> <p> In his meeting with Scholz, Xi said that under the current circumstances, it is particularly important for the two countries to maintain sound and steady growth of bilateral ties and better harness the stabilizing, constructive and steering role of this relationship.</p> <p> This not only serves the interests of the Chinese and German peoples but will also contribute significantly to world peace and tranquility, he said.</p> <p> There is no change in China's commitment to developing ties with Germany; there is no change in China's sincere wish for closer cooperation with Germany; and there is no change in China's conviction that China and Germany can make greater differences together, Xi emphasized.</p> <p> These remarks shed light on the value and significance of China-Germany relations, pointing the way to future cooperation and dialogue between the two countries.</p> <p> Meanwhile, past achievements have laid a solid foundation for the steady development of China-Germany relations. In the past five decades since the two countries established diplomatic ties, the bilateral relationship has shown great vitality, endurance, resilience and potential.</p> <p> While Germany is China's most important trading partner in Europe, China has been Germany's top trade partner for six consecutive years. The trade volume between them has mushroomed to more than 250 billion U.S. dollars in 2021 from less than 300 million dollars at the very beginning of diplomatic relations.</p> <p> Nearly 60 percent of German companies in China reported improved business operations last year, and 71 percent plan further investment in the country, according to a report released by the German Chamber of Commerce in China and KPMG.</p> <p> As for the question of how China and Germany manage to develop together and contribute to each other's success, Xi offered an appropriate answer: It is essentially attributable to a commitment to mutual respect and win-win cooperation, a valuable piece of experience and important principle that should be upheld all along.</p> <p> There is immense potential remains for the two countries to enrich their relations and deepen their mutually beneficial cooperation regarding climate change, macroeconomic policy, environmental protection, services trade, AI and digitalization.</p> <p> In addition, China is speeding up its efforts to foster a new development paradigm, which means broader market opportunities for Germany and all other countries.</p> <p> Xi called on the two sides to stand for true multilateralism, uphold international fairness and justice, defend the UN's central role in international affairs, safeguard basic norms governing international relations, promote an open world economy, and make global development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive.</p> <p> He also expressed his hope for Germany's active support for and participation in the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, with a view to building a community with a shared future for mankind.</p> <p> Since Germany is a pivotal country in the EU, the continent's security is closely associated with Germany. Notably, the ongoing Ukraine crisis has pushed European security to a crossroads.</p> <p> On this issue, China always stands on the side of peace and makes its conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter, working in its own way to promote peace and defuse tensions.</p> <p> Xi has emphasized during that meeting: "It is important to make every effort to prevent the conflict from intensifying or magnifying to a point of no return."</p> <p> For that purpose, the European side needs to show historical responsibility and political wisdom, bear in mind the long-term stability of Europe, and promote a solution in a responsible manner, Xi said, stressing that the security of Europe should be kept in the hands of Europeans themselves.</p> <p> China's appeal for peace and stability has been widely welcomed in Europe and beyond. When reporting on the video meeting, many European media outlets, including Reuters, headlined Xi's call to prevent the Ukraine conflict from intensifying, fully reflecting how the international community supports China's take on this issue.</p> <p> In an unsettled international situation, sound and steady growth in China-EU relations remains more crucial than ever.</p> <p> The China-Europe relationship is not targeted at, subjugated to, or controlled by any third party, which is a strategic consensus that both sides must follow in the long run, Xi said.</p> <p> Therefore, Xi highlighted the importance for China and the EU, with a dialectical and long-term view, with mutual respect and with the right perception, to increase communication and enhance mutual trust.</p> <p> Deepening China-Germany and China-EU cooperation will serve the interest of both sides and even the whole world. By adhering to mutual respect, openness and inclusiveness; seeking common ground while reserving differences; and cooperating for win-win results, China-Germany and China-EU relations will indeed ride the wave of uncertainty towards a brighter future.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese leadership has once again underscored what role the youth should play in the nation's rejuvenation drive.</p> <p> In a speech on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged members of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) to be responsible, have firm convictions and work hard as the 73.7 million-strong organization celebrated its centenary.</p> <p> The younger generation, according to Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, should do their best to help realize national rejuvenation -- the greatest dream of the Chinese people since the Opium War of 1840.</p> <p> The destiny of any generation is closely connected with the era they live in. The youth have more opportunities to achieve their dreams when they chime with the cause of the Party and the people.</p> <p> The pursuit of the Chinese Dream is a relay race. Since completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects in 2021, China has now embarked on a new journey -- building a great modern socialist country in all respects by the mid-21st century.</p> <p> Standing at a new historical juncture, Chinese youth in the new era should take on their responsibility, and they will be blessed with a spacious and promising platform.</p> <p> In his speech, Xi urged youth league members to "always stand on the high ground of ideals and convictions."</p> <p> Ideals and convictions serve as a beacon for life and pursuits. They determine a person's position and direction. Young people need to observe society, reflect on life, and create a future on the strength of wisdom.</p> <p> Xi said they should aim high at an early age and cultivate the trust in the Party, the confidence in socialism with Chinese characteristics and the belief in Marxism from the bottom of their heart.</p> <p> The importance of hard work was also highlighted by Xi.</p> <p> The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no easy task. It will not be achieved by simply "beating drums and gongs." Daunting challenges are inevitable in this new journey.</p> <p> Chinese youth in the new era must work hard. Xi said the younger generation is the most energetic and enterprising and the least conservative force in society. The cause of the Party and the people could not have developed without the arduous dedication made by generations of young people.</p> <p> Chinese youth will always be the vanguard force in realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and meeting challenges in a world undergoing changes unseen in a century.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> According to Philippine media, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, cemented a landslide election victory over Vice President Leni Robredo. Furthermore, his running mate, Sara Duterte, daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, also won the vice presidential election. Because of their close policy philosophy, Philippine media outlets said the two would form "joined forces" and predicted that the new administration would most likely continue Duterte's relatively pragmatic and balanced style.</p> <p> US and Western public opinion generally labeled it as "the most important election in the Philippines over the four decades," and believe that the election result will affect the direction of the Philippines on Washington's "Indo-Pacific chessboard." They have tried to interfere and guide the Philippine electoral agenda from the very beginning of the election. For example, they simply and rudely categorize candidates as "pro-US" and "pro-China," underlining that this is a "contest of values," and hyping that all candidates except Marcos Jr. are "in tough stance" on issues of the South China Sea. These "hints" are so stark that they almost lecture Filipino voters how to vote.</p> <p> Marcos Jr. made it clear that he would not lean to either China or the US, and would only be "pro-Philippines." He has repeatedly expressed his desire to develop relations with China, called for a solution to the South China Sea issue through dialogue and described China as a "friend." These remarks suggesting his reluctance of taking sides have stimulated some forces in the US and the West. As a result, some US and Western media outlets labeled him as the "son of a dictator." After Marcos Jr. secured the win, they warned that "kowtowing to China" would put the Philippines once again "in a weak position."</p> <p> Frankly speaking, these expressions are quite rude, implying extreme disrespect and even humiliation of Filipinos as well as contempt for the country's sovereignty.</p> <p> In the eyes of some arrogant people from the US and the West, it seems Filipinos should only care about the "China threat" and US Indo-Pacific Strategy. And if the people of a country don't make the "right choice" as Washington wants, it shows the "fragility" of that nation's democracy.</p> <p> Calling its allies and partners, Washington is eager to stir up trouble in the South China Sea. But these forces are becoming increasingly "pretentious" in the region. In this year's presidential election, Marcos Jr. was supported by a large number of young Filipinos who care the most about the economy and employment rather than the dogmatic "values" of the US and the West.</p> <p> Marcos has rich experience in local governance with good record among governors in the Philippines. Some US and Western media portrayed his victory as a "victory for Beijing," pretending not to see Filipinos' desire for national unity and development - such a yearning is strongly supported in Southeast Asia.</p> <p> It's clear that the US is taking advantage of the Philippines while not giving it the respect it deserves. The US is unwilling to truly spend any money to help the Southeast Asian nation's development, but still constantly interferes in the latter's internal affairs. In fact, Washington has never treated Manila with sincerity. It sometimes has to make the gesture of roping in the Philippines due to its geopolitical value. This makes US policy toward the Philippines erratic, contradictory and hypocritical. Refusing to be a tool for the US to contain China, Duterte eased relations with China after taking office. This has proven to be more in line with the Philippines' national interests. It is also what Filipinos want to see.</p> <p> It is worth noting that it is a discourse trap that the US and Western media labeled Duterte or Marcos as "pro-China." That word has been twisted by US and Western media into "kowtowing to China." In fact, they want to use the label to hinder and intimidate goodwill and rationality toward China in the Philippines and drive a wedge between the two countries.</p> <p> China respects the choice of the Philippine people. China-Philippine relations are based on the fact that the two countries share common interests. We hope that both sides will continue to create new opportunities for common development and bring more practical benefits to the people of both countries while enhancing peace and stability in Asia.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Global Times</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative Wang Qishan, also Chinese vice president, attends the inauguration ceremony of South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol on Tuesday, at the invitation of the South Korean government.</p> <p> Back in March following Yoon's election victory, Xi held a telephone conversation with him, during which the Chinese leader pointed out that the two countries are permanent close neighbors that cannot move away, and are also inseparable partners. Those diplomatic moves, particularly as the two countries observe the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year, reflect Beijing's expectation to forge closer and more productive partnership with Seoul.</p> <p> China-South Korea relations have blossomed over the past three decades, with considerable interaction and exchanges of businesses and people, laying a sound foundation for future cooperation, including in regional and international affairs.</p> <p> China has become South Korea's largest trading partner, export destination and import source. In 2021, the trade volume between China and South Korea reached 362.35 billion U.S. dollars.</p> <p> In June 2020, a demonstration zone for China-South Korea cooperation was unveiled in northeast China's Jilin province, where a batch of industrial parks have been planned for bilateral collaboration in medicine, IT, high-end equipment and intelligent manufacturing, among other fields.</p> <p> This year also marks the China-South Korea Year of Cultural Exchanges. Sharing close East Asian cultural roots, the two sides have seen notable headway in people-to-people exchanges in recent years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the two countries' people-to-people exchanges reached 10 million visits per year. Both sides are also each other's top source of overseas students.</p> <p> According to Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming, the two governments are planning to take the anniversary of diplomatic ties and the year of cultural exchanges as an opportunity to step up people-to-people exchanges between the two countries and revitalize bilateral communications and cooperation in the fields of press, think-tank, sports and arts.</p> <p> As a South Korean adage goes: While a house could be bought with a handful of coppers, a good neighbor is worth thousands of pieces of gold. The past achievements in cooperation between the two neighbors have demonstrated that they are partners with converging interests, not adversaries from different camps.</p> <p> As two important countries in East Asia, China and South Korea shoulder great responsibility to preserve regional peace and stability. And that depends on mutual respect for each other's major security concerns.</p> <p> In early May, South Korea's National Intelligence Service confirmed the decision to join the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Also, Seoul's foreign minister nominee Park Jin said recently that South Korea is considering attending a NATO summit in Madrid next month.</p> <p> These moves do not necessarily mean an actual NATO membership, yet China has made it clear that NATO, a product of the Cold War, has repeatedly violated international law and wantonly waged wars against sovereign countries. Allowing NATO to expand its influence in the Asia-Pacific would only undermine regional security and peace, and provoke confrontation.</p> <p> In fact, maintaining regional security and stability, which can only be achieved through dialogue and consultation, is in the common interest of both China and South Korea and the whole region. A political settlement to the Korean Peninsula issue, one of South Korea's top security concerns, tallies with China's position.</p> <p> To that end, China is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with South Korea on Peninsula affairs and provide assistance within its capacity, as Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated on various diplomatic occasions.</p> <p> Keeping peace and harmony with neighbors is embedded in the Chinese people's long-established values. It is hoped that the new South Korean government can join China in maintaining the hard-earned development momentum in bilateral relations and jointly build a more peaceful and prosperous Asia-Pacific community.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The Russia-Ukraine conflict has broken the peace of Europe, which is a pernicious consequence of the containment strategy implemented by the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) toward Russia over the past decades.</p> <p> As a product of the Cold War, NATO should have been dissolved when the Cold War ended. However, in order to maintain its global hegemony, the U.S. has stuck to the Cold War mentality, willfully pursued group politics, and continued to use NATO as a strategic tool for controlling Europe and containing Russia.</p> <p> Europe, caught in the vortex of bloc confrontation, has become one of the main victims of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p> <p> The conflict between Russia and Ukraine will exert a serious impact on the European economy. In 2008, the U.S.-originated global financial crisis severely impacted Europe, plunging many European countries, especially countries in Southern Europe, nto austerity due to soaring fiscal deficit and debt.</p> <p> Fourteen years later, the sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) against Russia and Russia’s counter-sanctions following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have again made a massive impact on the European economy.</p> <p> Prices have already skyrocketed in many countries in Europe. EU’s policies on decoupling from Russia have increased its reliance on more expensive liquefied natural gas from the U.S., significantly elevated production costs of European companies, and weakened the long-term competitiveness of European industry, which will disrupt Europe’s energy transition and climate policies and once again raise the levels of fiscal deficit and debt in Europe.</p> <p> The combined impacts of the Ukraine crisis and other structural factors have rendered the long-term economic prognosis for Europe rather bleak. The gaps between Europe and the U.S. in terms of both economic growth rate and size are believed to become wider.</p> <p> The Russia-Ukraine conflict will escalate Europe’s political and social division. Over the past more than 10 years, Europe has been plagued by increasingly prominent social and political division and polarization besides economic slowdown, which is largely a consequence of unsatisfactory economic conditions and declining living standards.</p> <p> Europe has lost 10 years to the global financial crisis. Socially and politically, the continent's countries would suffer irreparable harm if the Russia-Ukraine conflict were to drag on for another decade.</p> <p> Continuation and escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict will pose serious risks to the security of Europe. The U.S. and NATO are currently escalating confrontation with Russia. As they significantly increase military spending, the possibility of a new Iron Curtain in Europe goes straight up.</p> <p> Many European countries are close neighbors of Russia. Hostility, antagonism, and confrontation between them and Russia can easily spiral up and worsen, which is detrimental to Europe’s security. This can hinder Europe’s development and cause accident and misjudgment that lead to new conflict or even war.</p> <p> The strategic goal of the U.S. is to maintain its global hegemony. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has severely damaged Europe’s economic and security interests, but served the strategic intentions of the U.S.</p> <p> If Europe stops getting its energy from Russia, U.S. energy, which was not competitive before, will be able to quickly take over European markets.</p> <p> Besides, a large portion of the substantial increase in military expenditure in European countries will flow into the U.S. and help improve the capabilities of U.S. military enterprises to develop and produce new equipment and weapons, which eventually increases Europe’s military dependence on the U.S.</p> <p> With tensions between Europe and Russia mounting, the U.S. can not only use security guarantee as a pretext for further tightening control over Europe, but realize the goal of containing Russia through Europe.</p> <p> Affected to different degrees by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe have clearly different strategic intentions in responding to the conflict. In the long run, Europe needs to handle its relations with Russia on the basis of its own interests, carry out more active and productive dialogue with Russia and build a new security framework that can truly help realize lasting peace and stability in Europe. Such a new security framework will also enhance Europe’s strategic autonomy to a great extent.</p> <p> Europe has tried to pursue strategic autonomy for a long time, but the endeavor has been openly or secretly obstructed and opposed by the U.S.</p> <p> The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not only brought the fact of Europe’s lack of strategic autonomy under the spotlight, but further demonstrated the necessity for it to enhance strategic autonomy.</p> <p> Facts have shown that hegemonism, power politics, and bloc confrontation pursued by the U.S. will only undermine Europe’s interests, and only a stable UN-centered international system that sticks to multilateralism can serve its interests.</p> <p> In recent years, many farsighted personages in Europe have become keenly aware that the U.S. is not a reliable ally of Europe. While the extremely selfish “America First” policy advocated by the previous U.S. administration strained the relations between the U.S. and Europe, the current U.S. administration has only changed the wording, rather than the “America First” essence of the country’s foreign policy.</p> <p> Many of Washington’s actions, including insistence on the restrictive “Buy American” provisions over the past years, the hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and the establishment of the so-called trilateral security partnership with Britain and Australia, have made Europe more alert to the “America First” policy.</p> <p> <em>Zhang Jian is Assistant President of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) and Director of the CICIR Institute of European Studies.</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- John Lee was successfully elected as the six-term chief executive designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Sunday after an election conducted in full accordance with the electoral laws and in a fair and orderly manner.</p> <p> However, some forces in the U.S.-led West, though they are in no position to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, have once again thrown mud at the election and China.</p> <p> By repeating the obsolete cliches about their so-called "democracy," "freedom" and "political pluralism," their real aim is just to smear Hong Kong's electoral system and force the city into their Western system.</p> <p> There arises a question whether the electoral system in the West is really advanced. And facts have proven that the West's system can by no means be regarded as progressive.</p> <p> More than 150 years ago, Mark Twain, a famous American writer, wrote the popular classic novel Running for Governor, which vividly depicted the chaos of American elections at that time -- various dazzling episodes like those in the House of Cards.</p> <p> All kinds of dirty campaign methods popped up, which even can turn the candidates into "perjurer, thief, body-snatcher, delirium tremens, corruptionist, loathsome embracer."</p> <p> Compared with more than 150 years ago, today's media have evolved and their methods are more advanced. However, there are still frequent election messes in the United States, and partisan struggles and political polarization are increasingly intensifying, which even the American media have exposed from time to time.</p> <p> In essence, the elections in the United States are a thorough money politics, a game in which the powerful take turns to deal cards, divide the spoils and play with the "revolving door" of power and money, and they have nothing to do with ordinary people. Enough farces in the U.S. elections have been seen over the years.</p> <p> As a part of China, Hong Kong is perfectly justified to say no to the House-of-Cards game played by Western politicians, and take measures it deems appropriate to avoid the American Running-for-Governor chaos in elections.</p> <p> Not long before, due to loopholes in the electoral system, some radical separatist forces penetrated into Hong Kong's governance structure, wantonly kidnapped the overall interests of Hong Kong society, and seriously harmed the well-being of Hong Kong's general public, putting national security and Hong Kong's democratic development in peril.</p> <p> In response, China's central government has taken decisive steps to improve the electoral system of the HKSAR, resolutely enhance the central government's overall governance over the region, and implement the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," making certain that Hong Kong can only be governed by those who love it and the country as a whole.</p> <p> Generally, practice is the best touchstone for a system. From the Election Committee elections last September and the election of the seventh-term Legislative Council last December to the chief executive election, the series of successful elections has shed light on the advantages and the progressive nature of Hong Kong's new electoral system, which respects the "one country, two systems" principle and is suited to Hong Kong's realities.</p> <p> Given the socio-economic development of Hong Kong over the past year, the new electoral system, which has shown great vitality, is believed to ensure social stability, economic development and improvement of people's livelihood in the city.</p> <p> With broad participation, the process of the chief executive election has thoroughly embodied the core values of democracy. Behind Lee's victory with a high number of votes is the support and affirmation from the general public in Hong Kong.</p> <p> At a time when the new electoral system is taking root and the city's democratic development is under optimization, the United States and its Western allies' smearing and accusations against the election only revealed their malicious intention to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.</p> <p> As such "democracy countries" as the United States and some of its Western allies are still caught in rampant social messes and chaos, they are in no position to make the irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong.</p> <p> Hong Kong's democratic path and its electoral system are China's internal affairs, which brook no external interference.</p> <p> Any attempts to slander Hong Kong's new electoral system, impede Hong Kong's democratic development and prosperity, and contain China's development are doomed to fail.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> Dwindling exports, government spending, and shrinking markets in the U.S. conspired to produce a withering Gross Domestic Product. Pointing toward another potential recession, the GDP fell by an annualized rate of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. Still, U.S. federal authorities want to tighten the economy even more to force down wages for the working class and weaken the effectiveness of what some call the “Great Resignation.”</p> <p> Inflation and a tight monetary policy are the latest tools in a systemic class war targeting U.S. workers. Since the pandemic produced a massive shift in the economic organization in 2020 and 2021, many workers refused to work except in jobs and professions that provided the best incomes.</p> <p> As labor activists Sarita Gupta and Erica Smiley write in their recent book, <em>The Future We Need</em>, millions of workers “were able to leverage a tight labor market to simply leave their jobs and not work for anything less than what they deemed fair.”</p> <p> In addition, more workers found joining or organizing labor unions an excellent choice to strengthen their bargaining position with employers.</p> <p> Employers and their political allies reacted swiftly. Many corporations drove up prices, and corporate-owned media began to talk about the problem of inflation and budget deficits. They demanded and got a federal monetary policy that would protect their profit margins.</p> <p> Even before employment rates had reached pre-pandemic levels—which were already showing signs of weakness—U.S. politicians and the Federal Reserve authorities pushed to tighten the money supply with higher interest rates. President Joe Biden backed off promises for new rounds of economic investments—even as the U.S. political system ground to a halt unable to pass new laws to stimulate long-term economic stability.</p> <p> Promises to forgive hundreds of billions in student loan debt have been kicked down the road. Little action has been taken to push for a higher minimum wage, and new investments in education, infrastructure, and technological research are lacking.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0509/FOREIGN202205091656000509796936320.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 540px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Illustration: Chen Xia/GT</em></p> <p> One exception stands out. War. President Biden’s handling of U.S. policy on the Ukraine crisis has seen swift and unanimous action by the political class to provide tens of billions of dollars of new spending for military contracts. U.S. policy has focused on escalating the war by giving Ukraine a seemingly endless supply of weapons. Instead of fulfilling its obligations to call for peace and talks, the U.S. government has promoted a wider conflict.</p> <p> The U.S. political class—nearly unanimously in both major political parties—has agreed to unified action to boost resources for the military-industrial complex.</p> <p> This deliberate choice has proven to be beneficial for U.S.-based military contractors. Media reports indicated that Biden administration officials met with representatives of the top 8 military contractors in the U.S. in mid-April to plan its approach to extending the Ukraine conflict. U.S. arms giants, securing promises for $33 billion in new Pentagon arms deals to Ukraine and in loans to European countries to purchase weapons systems.</p> <p> Top NATO officials seem fixated on extending the alliance to other European countries to foster hostilities with Russia and its allies.&nbsp;</p> <p> Critics of U.S. policy believe that the goal of this policy, other than funneling more spending into the coffers of the military contractors, aims to destabilize Russia. Even though Russia has not recovered from the “shock therapy” after the collapse of the Cold War, its control over the flow of natural gas and petroleum resources into Europe has given it disproportionate influence over the European economy.</p> <p> In the 2000s, NATO and the U.S. resisted Russian requests for admittance into NATO and the European economy, fearing a shift in European allegiances to the east.</p> <p> The longer-term U.S. agenda appears to aim to find whatever means are available to stall or weaken China’s economic growth and global influence. Rather than systematic talks to defuse tensions or develop cooperative, if competitive, forms of engagement, the U.S. political class and its corporate allies seem obsessed with maintaining the U.S. dominance of a unipolar world system.</p> <p> In the meantime, the people of Ukraine are made to suffer as the U.S. denies real progress at the diplomatic table. Further, the actual investments required to meet the needs of the U.S. people will have to be put off until the next war has ended. The people of both countries have an immediate interest in peace that their rulers have denied them.</p> <p> <em>The author is an associate professor of Liberal Studies Department at Grand Valley State University in the U.S.</em></p> <p> <em>The opinions expressed in the article reflect those of the author, and not necessarily those of People's Daily Online.&nbsp;</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The election of the sixth-term chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was held successfully on Sunday. John Lee Ka-chiu was elected with 99.16 percent of the votes. This shows that "patriots governing Hong Kong" is deeply bolstered by all sectors in the Hong Kong society, and the democratic development of Hong Kong has turned a new page after the improvement of the electoral system.</p> <p> Some people in the US and the West are quite reluctant to see this new page. Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on Sunday openly denied the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong, and exploited the rhetoric used by "lecturers of democracy" to smear Hong Kong's new electoral system, attacking the practice as being "another step in the dismantling of the 'one country, two systems' principle." In response to this law-abiding, open and fair election, the US and the Western media outlets have launched a full-scale attack, and some politicians have expressed their "sour grapes mentality" as a conditioned reflex.</p> <p> Facts have proven that some forces in the US and the West have tried every trick in the book to destabilize Hong Kong. Although it has been nearly 25 years since Hong Kong returned to the motherland, they still miss the page on which the Treaty of Nanking was signed 180 years ago. They are very nostalgic for the chapter in which Hong Kong citizens were not given freedom during 156 years of British colonial rule. What they are reluctant to remember, and what we must underline, is that Hong Kong today is not the land that Britain occupied in the war of aggression when it forcibly sold opium to China. Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, which has entered the era of "patriots governing Hong Kong."</p> <p> Why fear for comparison between Hong Kong's past and present! Gone are the days when those who were against China attempted rampantly to destabilize Hong Kong in 2019. The Chinese central government made its assessment of the situation and decisively stopped riots, restored order, transitioned from chaos to stability and brought the city back on the right track of development. The improved electoral system of Hong Kong is conductive to selecting officials based on their integrity and ability and their working hard for the people. This is the embodiment of high-quality democracy.</p> <p> Lee has served Hong Kong for more than 40 years. He is very familiar with Hong Kong. In fighting the violent demonstrations against the extradition bill, he played a key supporting role in restoring order and rebuilding confidence. Lee is thus widely welcomed by the public. His election is a vivid practice of "patriots governing Hong Kong." All walks of life in Hong Kong have full confidence in him leading the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to consolidate the transition from chaos to order and to start good governance.</p> <p> Behind the many problems that have emerged in Hong Kong in recent years, there is invariably the shadow of some US and Western hostile forces. The more chaotic Hong Kong becomes, the better it is in their interests. A united and progressive Hong Kong has interrupted their minds to mess up Hong Kong. Those black-clad violent protesters, whom some US media called "former activists," are now feeling "desperate." "Patriots governing Hong Kong" will certainly make the US and Western hostile forces as well as their proxy in Hong Kong desperate. Only when they are desperate, there is hope for Hong Kong</p> <p> Today in Hong Kong, people yearn for stability and unity in their hearts. Throughout the whole process of the Chief Executive Election, the Hong Kong society has demonstrated its unity and enterprising spirit, which is the new glory of the "Lion Rock Spirit" that Hong Kong people have always taken pride in. We believe that Hong Kong will create brilliance in the new journey, and the practice of "one country, two systems" will be stable and far-reaching.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Global Times</p> ]]></full-text>

However, the consequences of the conflict are largely borne by Europe.</p> <p> While addressing a G7 leaders meeting on March 24, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden said that “NATO is as strong and united as it has ever been.”</p> <p> This remark undoubtedly tied Europe closer to the war wagon driven by the U.S. in the latter’s attempt to seek hegemony, and forced NATO to follow Washington in imposing sanctions, while paying the price for these actions.</p> <p> Affected by the massive sanctions targeting Russia, multiple economic indicators of Europe worsened. Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for Economy, earlier pointed out that after the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the soaring prices of bulk commodities pushed inflation to a new high; suspended trade ties aggravated supply chain pressures, and consumer confidence dropped sharply, all indicating that the conflict has had a significant and far-reaching impact on the European economy.</p> <p> In addition, European countries also face huge pressure from the refugee crisis triggered by the conflict. The UN Refugee Agency announced on April 20 that more than 5 million refugees from Ukraine had crossed borders into neighboring countries, causing an unprecedented refugee crisis.</p> <p> As the culprit behind the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S., however, is reaping benefits without getting itself involved militarily.</p> <p> The European stock market fell sharply; the euro drastically weakened against the dollar, and a significant amount of hedge funds flew out of Europe to the U.S. In March, the U.S. received only 12 refugees from Ukraine, with a large number of Ukrainian refugees still waiting at the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition, since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the stock prices of U.S. military firms soared, indicating that U.S. firms are making a great fortune from the conflict.</p> <p> It is pretty clear who benefits from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and who loses from it.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Chen Jianli)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- While China is still checking new epidemic flare-ups with its dynamic zero-COVID approach, some Western bigots sensed a chance to talk badly about the country's anti-pandemic efforts and heap scorn on the Chinese government's epidemic control policies.</p> <p> For example, in its latest rant against Shanghai's anti-epidemic fight, The New York Times (NYT) has gone to great lengths to depict an inept Chinese government and question the "legitimacy" of the Communist Party of China (CPC) "in a time of crisis."</p> <p> But all those jabs have crumbled in the face of facts. As China has struck a fine balance between pandemic control and economic development, its way of taming the virus has proven to be scientific and effective, and has testified to the country's institutional strength.</p> <p> For more than two years, China has been putting people's lives and well-being first and sticking to its dynamic zero-COVID approach. In the meantime, it has been making dynamic conditions-based adjustments to its targeted epidemic control measures. All these efforts, coupled with an epidemic prevention focus to guard against both inbound cases and domestic resurgence, have enabled the country to restrict the spread of the virus and minimize the epidemic's impact.</p> <p> As the highly contagious and latent Omicron variant is sweeping the world, multiple Chinese regions have been overshadowed by the current COVID-19 resurgence. But China has been rising to the challenge.</p> <p> Through a resolute and full implementation of the dynamic zero-COVID approach, and with the whole-hearted support of the Chinese people, Shenzhen in southern China resumed normal work and production in late March as the resurgence subsides, while community transmission has been cut in Jilin Province since mid-April. Racing against time, Beijing has carried out multiple rounds of nucleic acid testing, and has grasped the basic picture of hidden transmission in society.</p> <p> Besides, data shows the epidemic situation is steadily improving and under effective control in the city of Shanghai. Daily new COVID-19 cases have fallen from a peak of 27,000 to under 5,000, and nearly two-thirds of the infections have recovered in the city. Over 70 percent of Shanghai's 1,800-plus major enterprises have resumed work and production, and the resumption rate of the first batch of more than 660 key industrial enterprises in the city has exceeded 90 percent.</p> <p> China's capability of successfully arranging massive nucleic acid tests, building makeshift hospitals, dispatching medical staff and delivering much-needed supplies have all demonstrated the country's systemic ability to pool strength behind significant undertakings and the solidarity of the Chinese people.</p> <p> Under the guidance of the Chinese central government, Shanghai has mobilized nucleic acid testing teams with a daily handling capacity of 2.38 million test tubes. More than 30,000 medics from 22 provincial-level regions nationwide have rushed to the city to aid in the anti-epidemic battle. To many experts, such prompt actions in Shanghai are a miniature of China's unprecedented mobilization and organization abilities made possible out of the strong and wise leadership of the CPC, which has firmly stood as the most reliable backbone of the Chinese nation and people.</p> <p> According to preliminary statistics in late April, more than 720,000 Party members volunteered to report for duty during the current resurgence in Shanghai. As of April 30, Party members have also helped set up 164 nucleic acid testing sites in the city.</p> <p> Support from the people makes a difference in the anti-epidemic response, noted a meeting convened on Thursday by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, stressing the need to make sure that the Chinese people are well-informed, and to timely respond to their concerns.</p> <p> This people-oriented philosophy, warmly welcomed and highly appreciated by the Chinese people, has secured China in achieving major strategic progress. Among major economies, China has been the first to bring the pandemic largely under control, the first to resume work and production, and the first to achieve economic growth. Even though thousands of daily cases have been reported recently, China, the world's most populous country, is still one of the countries with the lowest infection rates worldwide.</p> <p> "The comprehensive strategy, marked by rapid mass testing, vaccinations and government support in terms of care for the afflicted, stands in stark contrast to what has happened in other jurisdictions around the world," noted Kenya-based international relations scholar Cavince Adhere. "On the basis of the experience, China is now taking right steps for its densely populated cities and around," said Muzaherul Huq, former Southeast Asia Region adviser at the World Health Organization.</p> <p> The Chinese people's growing confidence in the government's epidemic control policies, as well as the international community's broad recognition of China's anti-pandemic achievements, have slapped the NYT and its like in the face. In the time ahead, more practice will prove that China's epidemic control strategy is the right choice that can stand the test of history.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

By cooperating with South Korea's spy agency, the US-led NATO is attempting to turn the Northeast Asian country into a chess piece to contain China and Russia in the realm of cyber defense. It has extended its cyber defense to the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and even the Indo-Pacific region, paving the way for the interference of Western forces in regional geopolitical affairs.</p> <p> Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that South Korea joining NATO's cyber defense cooperation offers room for the country to join other US-led intelligence mechanisms. Last year, the National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2022 from the US House of Representatives already required the US administration to consider expanding the Five Eyes alliance to include South Korea and three others if enacted.</p> <p> "If the US is to contain China or Russia and wins in actual military conflict, it must gain an upper hand in intelligence-gathering. The rearrangement of the US-led cyber and intelligence groups aims to create a global network," said Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and commentator.</p> <p> South Korea under the incoming administration of Yoon Suk-yeol is believed to enhance ties with the US. The country will welcome US President Joe Biden later this month, his first trip to Asia since coming into office. South Korea is also considering attending the NATO summit slated for late June. Yoon has said he will "positively review" South Korea's joining of Quad if invited.</p> <p> Seoul is betting its own security on the US-led groupings. However, Song noted that if Seoul deepens cooperation with NATO or even joins NATO, it would only make itself more insecure.</p> <p> "South Korea's security can only be ensured when it builds mutual trust with neighboring countries, rather than becoming the political and military henchman of NATO," said Song.</p> <p> It is also worth noting that what serves US interests does not necessarily serve its allies. Although the US wants to expand its military outreach globally, it is not easy for NATO to expand to the Indo-Pacific region.</p> <p> "Most NATO member states are EU countries who have already been badly battered by the crisis on their own soil. They do not want to be dragged into any crisis in Asia, nor do they want to overdraft the limited resources. NATO expansion to Asia fits the interests of only a few NATO members, such as the UK," said Song, adding that the US may want to achieve the globalization of NATO, but face the realistic problem of catering to all.</p> <p> NATO is a defensive organization in rhetoric only, while its actions can amount to the definition of an "aggressor." The US knows clearly what consequences Ukraine would face by inciting it to join NATO, but it still led Ukraine to embark on a path of no return.</p> <p> While Ukraine's joining NATO could provoke Russia's sense of insecurity, what South Korea does might trigger more confrontation with its neighbors, including China, Russia and North Korea, which may cause turbulence in the region, warned Song.</p> <p> NATO is trying to expand to China's periphery. By trying to create an Asian version of NATO, the US will seriously undermine economic cooperation and prosperity in Asia, and bring about new divisions to the regional geopolitical and geo-economic landscape. Washington's intention to turn an Asia-Pacific country into a frontier of geopolitical confrontation is not in the interests of regional countries including South Korea.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Global Times</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently visited Russia and Ukraine to mediate in the ongoing conflict, injecting new impetus into international efforts to resolve the strife through diplomacy and dialogue.</p> <p> Its 70-plus years of history and practice have proved that the UN, as the most universal, representative and authoritative inter-governmental international organization, is the best place to practice multilateralism and an effective platform for the international community to respond collectively to various threats and challenges.</p> <p> In troubled times, it becomes even more vital to maintain the global system with the UN at its core.</p> <p> Everybody knows that many hands make light work. Multilateralism in modern international relations originated from mankind's search for solutions to common problems.</p> <p> Since the end of WWII, with the vigorous development of the UN and other international organizations, multilateralism has gradually become the consensus of the international community to uphold peace, promote development and meet common challenges through multilateral cooperation.</p> <p> This consensus has led to accelerated economic globalization, increased international trade, and a stronger interconnection and interdependence between nations.</p> <p> The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, as regional hotspot issues keep cropping up, traditional and non-traditional security threats are intertwined, and transformative changes and the COVID-19 pandemic have posed severe challenges to the security and development of all countries.</p> <p> However, the United States still persists in pursuing unilateralism and hegemonism, engaging in power politics, harming other countries' security and development through unfair means, and provoking a new Cold War and geopolitical competitions. Its misbehavior has seriously undermined the international order and global strategic stability.</p> <p> In the face of complex and grim situations, the international community needs to practice true multilateralism and reject small cliques and bloc politics, strengthen solidarity and cooperation and oppose confrontation and pressure, as well as uphold equality and mutual trust and oppose hegemony and bullying.</p> <p> Only by moving in the right direction can the international community join forces to build a more prosperous, stable, fair and just world. Just as a famous Chinese saying goes: "Pool the wisdom of everyone and there is nothing you cannot achieve. Gather the strength of everyone and there is no victory you cannot win."</p> <p> Over the years, China has always held high the banner of multilateralism.</p> <p> On the international stage, Chinese leaders have made a strong call to uphold multilateralism, pointing out that the way out of the complex problems facing the world is "to uphold multilateralism and build a community with a shared future for mankind."</p> <p> China has been firmly upholding the international system with the UN at its core, the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the UN's authority and status, and its central role in international affairs.</p> <p> Facts have proved that China has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order.</p> <p> From the Belt and Road Initiative to the Global Development Initiative and then to the Global Security Initiative, China has provided one international public good after another, promoted world connectivity, boosted global cooperation and development, and injected more confidence into world peace and stability.</p> <p> History has shown time and again that when the UN's central role is taken seriously, the world will become peaceful. If individual countries are left to go their own way and start something else, the foundation of the "multilateral skyscraper" of the UN will be eroded.</p> <p> At a time when the international system with the UN at its core is facing severe challenges, all countries should keep in mind the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, bear in mind the larger interest of the international community, resolve differences through diplomacy and dialogue, and jointly promote global peace and development under the coordination of the UN.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p align="center" style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="House of Hegemony Illustration: Liu Rui/GT" src="/mediafile/pic/BIG/20220506/49/13708610952074627205.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 540px; width: 900px;" /></p> <p align="center" class="pictext"> <em>House of Hegemony Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</em></p> <p> Charles Richard, the head of US Strategic Command, which oversees the nuclear arsenal, warned Congress Wednesday that Washington faces a "heightened nuclear deterrence risk when it comes to Russia and China," claiming that China is "watching the war in Ukraine closely and will likely use nuclear coercion to their advantage in the future." He also warned the lawmakers that the US is facing "a crisis deterrence dynamic right now that we have only seen a few times in our nation's history."</p> <p> Sensationalizing China's "nuclear threat" to justify actual US nuclear expansion has become a familiar trick of Washington. Last month, Richard told lawmakers at a closed-door hearing that China's "breathtaking expansion" of its strategic and nuclear arsenal is a quickly escalating risk for the US. In March, he said he is "very concerned" about potential "cooperative aggression" from China and Russia. If the efforts are to expand the budget for the department he's in charge, Richard made it - according to the Biden administration's recently submitted fiscal year 2023 defense budget, total spending on nuclear weapons and systems research and procurement grew to $34.4 billion from $27.7 billion for fiscal year 2022.</p> <p> Of course, this is part of Washington's series ways to justify its arbitrary "nuclear freedom" and "nuclear hegemony" by pretending to worry that "deterrence is no longer sufficient." That is why politicians and media in Washington either hype disinformation like "China is building missile silos in its northwest part," or promote ridiculous fantasies, such as "China might use nuclear weapons in the Taiwan Straits," based completely on hypothetical assumptions. In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it was the US and Western media and politicians who hyped the risk of nuclear war and wanted to "bind" China to Russia, even though China had nothing to do with the war.</p> <p> These public opinion campaigns were "complemented" by a substantial step-by-step erosion of nuclear weapons limitations from the US. The Biden administration on one hand continues the nuclear weapons modernization efforts it inherited from the Trump administration. It increases investment to accelerate upgrading nuclear weapons and their delivery system, and maintain a low threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. On the other, the Biden administration has not corrected its predecessor's behavior of withdrawing from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which has undermined the international arms control system. The US has also further extended its nuclear forces beyond its territory. Under the leadership of Washington, NATO has expanded the scope of its "nuclear sharing" arrangements and actively promoted the forward deployment of nuclear weapons. And there have been voices in countries like Japan calling for "nuclear sharing" with the US.</p> <p> Everyone knows that the US is already the "nuclear giant" on earth. According to the estimation of foreign think tank on arms control, the number of nuclear warheads in the US and NATO member countries is about 20 times that of China's. The amount of China's nuclear weaponry and that of the US and its NATO allies is not on the same level. The US sits on the world's largest nuclear arsenal, splashes huge sums of money to modernize its nuclear weapons and constantly relaxes the restrictions of using nuclear weapons. The risk of strategic misjudgment caused by all those will be incalculable.</p> <p> China's nuclear policy is open and transparent. Of all five nuclear weapon states in the world, China is the only one that pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons. China has made it clear it will not engage in any nuclear arms race with any other country and will keep its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security.</p> <p> This means that the development of China's nuclear force has its own established pace and China will not dance to the tune of US hype. In contrast, Washington has deliberately upheld strategic ambiguity on the use of nuclear weapons, trying to leave room for self-interpretation for the use of nuclear weapons in the future. People seem to see that Washington is pointing at other people's noses with one hand, while its other hand is quietly unscrewing the bottle and letting the devil out.</p> <p> A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. At the beginning of this year, leaders of five nuclear weapon countries, China, Russia, the US, the UK and France, issued the Joint Statement on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, which stressed it again. It also expressed the common willingness to avoid military confrontation and prevent arms race. Washington should honor its commitment, rather than make petty moves of an arms race while shouting "deterrence crisis." On the nuclear issue, the "absolute advantage" and "absolute security" it pursues doesn't exist at all. Its strange logic will make all countries, including the US, feel unsafe. Washington should not be stubborn and should wake up in time.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Global Times</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 240,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a Imperial College London's orphanhood calculator showed. However, the American political elite is showing little interest in confronting the issue more than two years into the pandemic.</p> <p> Referred to as "pandemic orphans," these children are at increased risk of alcohol and substance abuse, dropping out of school, descending into poverty and committing suicide, according to studies.</p> <p> Inflicting a secondary pain on these pandemic orphans is the lack of attention to their immense suffering and the lack of urgency by government officials at all levels to do something about it.</p> <p> For a government that boasts of defending human rights, turning a blind eye to vulnerable children in its own country throws its credibility into doubt.</p> <p> A memorandum issued in early April by U.S. President Joe Biden only vaguely promised to lend federal support to pandemic orphans, who appear to be included as "individuals and families experiencing a loss due to COVID-19."</p> <p> Throughout the memorandum, which vows support for individuals and families suffering long-term effects of COVID-19, a clear and purposeful federal-level strategy to address COVID-19 orphanhood is nowhere to be found.</p> <p> Reading through the lines of the presidential memorandum, one may also easily and regretfully discover that the White House has failed to present a plan to address the psychological challenges faced by the pandemic orphans. It is undeniable that psychological intervention is among the most vital kinds of help that orphans now need.</p> <p> "Deprived of parental care, (orphans) can endure physical, psychological, emotional and social harm, with consequences that last a lifetime. These children are also more likely to experience violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation," read a July 2021 statement by Henrietta Fore, then the executive director of UNICEF.</p> <p> "To prevent and respond to this crisis for children in the immediate and long-term, it is vital that governments provide families with the emotional, practical and financial support they need," Fore said.</p> <p> It may already be too late. Mary Wall, a senior policy adviser on the White House's COVID-19 Response Team who will serve as the "bereavement lead," told the Atlantic magazine that the program would not have a dedicated team.</p> <p> Wall said additional funding might be needed at a certain point for the program to fulfill its aim. But in reality, Congress is so divided on approving additional COVID-related spending packages that lawmakers cannot even reach consensus on providing funding to ensure a continued supply of treatments, tests and vaccines -- all basic resources needed in the fight against COVID-19.</p> <p> A presidential strategy to combat the HIV epidemic, in which a big chunk of congressional appropriation is pledged for kids orphaned by AIDS, has been in place since 2003. But missing with COVID-19 orphans is a sense of responsibility and the will to help those hardest hit by the pandemic.</p> <p> "If we wanted to focus on children at home, we could absolutely do that," said Rachel Kidman, a social epidemiologist at Stony Brook University. "The expertise is there if the will is there."</p> <p> With another pandemic resurgence now pending, Congress has been preoccupied with funneling weapons and funds into Ukraine to help the country in the fighting that is half a globe away from the United States.</p> <p> The situation is dire, and government inaction will needlessly prolong the immeasurable suffering of innocent children.</p> <p> Unlike COVID cases that may rise and fall, orphanhood cannot come and go. Once orphaned, any sense of normalcy is likely gone forever.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Li He)</em></p> <p> <strong>Perhaps that is because of U.S. media's die-hard habit of smearing China in every possible way.</strong></p> <p> BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Once again, The New York Times (NYT) betrayed its ignorance of China.</p> <p> In a recent report on the COVID-19 fight in Shanghai, the American newspaper jumped to a conclusion that the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is being tested, because residents in Shanghai are volunteering to help each other out during "lockdown" in recent weeks. Such an argument is as ridiculous as it is malicious.</p> <p> In a stunningly far-fetched manner, the article tried to equate natural and warm-hearted mutual assistance with some kind of expression of discontent towards the CPC. Apparently, its authors were hardly touched by the love and care expressed by ordinary Chinese towards one another in their hours of difficulties. Perhaps that is because of U.S. media's die-hard habit of smearing China in every possible way.</p> <p> Indeed, Shanghai has been experiencing its most severe COVID-19 wave in the past two years. Its residents' life and work have been impacted by strict measures to contain the highly contagious Omicron variant. And at the early stage of the outbreak, some people encountered various kinds of inconveniences to get food supply and medical treatments.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0501/FOREIGN202205011904000228845068383.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 743px;" /></p> <p> <em>Du Shun (R), deputy manager of a Hema Fresh store in Wuhan, helps Liu Zengyu, a delivery man from Jiangxi Province, start his electric bicycle to deliver goods in Shanghai, east China, April 15, 2022. (Xinhua/Chen Jianli)</em></p> <p> After all, meeting the daily needs of more than 25 million residents in China's biggest city in highly restricted conditions with no precedent to follow has posed a strenuous challenge. That is why the local authorities have on many occasions acknowledged their problems, and vowed repeatedly to improve their services.</p> <p> And instead of hurting the CPC's legitimacy, the fact that hundreds of thousands of local citizens volunteer to lend each other help and support testifies to the strength of the Party.</p> <p> In fact, many of the volunteers are either organized by the local authorities or working closely with neighborhood committees. And among those tens of thousands of volunteers the NYT mentioned, a large portion of them are CPC members.</p> <p> "Wherever there is a need, there must be a Party member," the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee said in a recent open letter to CPC members in Shanghai. "Our Party members must go deep into the community and the masses, stand by and work with cadres and the people in the front line."</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0501/FOREIGN202205011904000398800485868.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>A volunteer waits for COVID-19 close contacts to board a transfer bus in Lianqin Village of Beicai Town, east China's Shanghai, April 28, 2022.(Xinhua/Jin Liwang)</em></p> <p> Official statistics show that more than 700,000 Party members in Shanghai have registered to join the city's anti-COVID fight, and a large number of CPC members have been working as volunteers in districts, towns and villages. In some communities, 90 percent of community volunteers are Party members.</p> <p> Anyone with some basic knowledge of the CPC's history would know that mobilizing the public to work with the Party in joint efforts to tide through hard times is both a tradition and a strength of the CPC, as the CPC has pledged that "everything is for the people and everything relies on the people."</p> <p> Today, there are more than 95 million Party members from all walks of life across China. They are both members of the big Chinese family and representatives of their fellow countrymen. According to a report by Harvard University, the Chinese people's overall satisfaction toward the central government has been above 90 percent for years. Any attempt to sow discord between the Chinese people and the CPC would be futile. The NYT's attack on China's dynamic zero-COVID policy would be no different.</p> <p> At the moment, the dynamic zero-COVID approach to containing the virus remains the most optimal choice for China.</p> <p> "If we are not firm about the dynamic zero-COVID policy, China may miss the best time to stem the resurgence of cases, which may lead to higher costs and unbearable consequences," said China's leading epidemiologist Liang Wannian.</p> <p> As China's economic center and an important link of the global supply chains, Shanghai can only minimize the impact of the pandemic on China and the global economy by putting the resurgence of COVID-19 cases under control and returning to normal as soon as possible. It is the broadest consensus shared by the general public in China.</p> <p> And from a global perspective, by strictly enforcing the dynamic zero-COVID policy, China is making a huge sacrifice to ensure the long-term economic viability of Shanghai in global trade and commerce, which would inject more certainty into the world economy.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0501/FOREIGN202205011904000533263760123.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>Travelers walk through terminals at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, the United States, April 14, 2022. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> What also should be noted is that by citing people's self-reliance as evidence of public frustration, the NYT actually exposed America's monumental failure in battling the pandemic. Over the past more than two years, Washington has largely failed to shoulder its responsibility in leading the anti-COVID-19 fight, and left the American people to fend for themselves.</p> <p> The NYT should quit its biased coverage on China, and try to understand the country and its ruling party better.</p> <p> In 1936, when the prospect of the CPC-led social revolution was still unclear, Edgar Snow, an American journalist, ventured to north of China's Shaanxi Province, where the CPC and its military "the Red Army" were based and surrounded by resourceful and powerful enemies. Through comprehensive interviews and objective analysis, Snow made an accurate and foresighted judgment in his report that the social revolution "would eventually win."</p> <p> In a cave dwelling on the Loess Plateau, Snow asked then 43-year-old Mao Zedong: the enemies' "economic resources many times surpassed ours, and they received material assistance from the outside. Why, then, has the Red Army scored success after success ... and not only survived still today but increased its power?"</p> <p> "The explanation is that the Red Army and the (CPC-established) Soviet Government had created among all people within their areas a rocklike solidarity, because everyone ... was voluntarily and consciously fighting for his own interests and what he believed to be right," Mao replied.</p> <p> Eighty-six years later, Snow's professionalism and Mao's words about the CPC's successes can still offer some clues about how the Western mainstream media, including the NYT, can tell their stories of China and the CPC.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Peng Ziyang)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- In a country of some 1.4 billion people, any public health issue is of significant concern, and the coronavirus outbreak is no exception.</p> <p> From combating the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei Province more than two years ago to the ongoing battle against the highly contagious Omicron variant, China has always adhered to a stringent approach to stamping out infections.</p> <p> China's anti-epidemic experience has demonstrated that its "dynamic zero-COVID" policy is not only the best option but also the bottom line that must be maintained for the country's current epidemic prevention and control work.</p> <p> Yet, the country's effective anti-pandemic efforts such as temporary lockdowns, brief closures of factories and stores, and suspension of offline classes in schools, have been repeatedly questioned by a number of Western media outlets as being excessively strict.</p> <p> While it is undeniably true that halting normal production can be costly, it is also true that the virus kills.</p> <p> Worldwide, the virus has claimed over 6 million lives. In sharp contrast, the death toll was about 5,000 on the Chinese mainland.</p> <p> By pursuing the dynamic zero-COVID approach, China has managed to safeguard people's lives and well-being and has minimized the epidemic's impact on economic and social development to the largest extent.</p> <p> With a huge population, China continues to face unbalanced regional development, as well as scarcity and uneven allocation of medical resources. Besides, the vaccination rates for the elderly and children are not high enough.</p> <p> In China, the number of those aged 60 and above, a group highly susceptible to COVID-19, is around 267 million. It is just unimaginable how many of them might have died had China not undertaken drastic efforts to combat the coronavirus.</p> <p> The stringent anti-epidemic measures inevitably lead to short-term economic pains, but dynamic zero-COVID is overall a counter-epidemic policy that ensures economic development.</p> <p> In the first quarter of 2022, China's GDP increased by 4.8 percent year on year. Against the backdrop of global inflation, domestic prices remain steady. The value of goods trade in the period rose 10.7 percent. China's major industrial firms saw their profits up 8.5 percent year on year.</p> <p> As a result, it is not difficult to conclude that China's dynamic zero-COVID policy complements and bolsters the normal operation of the economy and society. The policy has woven a strong safety net for the 1.4 billion Chinese people.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- For some time, the United States and some other countries as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have been spreading disinformation about China's stance on the Ukraine situation, and making groundless accusations to attack and smear China. The falsehoods, confusing right with wrong are an attempt to mislead the world. China's position on the Ukraine issue is above board, objective and fair.</p> <p> Some examples of the disinformation and the reality are presented below to help the world understand what is really going on.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> Falsehood 1: A U.S. intelligence report said China told Russia that it would not prevent Russia from taking actions in Ukraine,while asking Russia not to do it before the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics. It also said that Russia has asked China for assistance including weapons and other equipment.</p> <p> Reality Check: Russia is a sovereign country that independently weighs,decides and implements its foreign policy based on its own strategy and interests. There is no need to seek China's consent beforehand. In fact, U.S. officials have admitted that there is no evidence of China providing military assistance to Russia.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> ◆On March 14, 2022, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia had the potential to conduct an operation in Ukraine and had not requested assistance from other countries.</p> <p> https://ria.ru/20220314/ukraina-1778071724.html</p> <p> ◆According to media reports, information reported by The New York Times based on an anonymous source was actually provided by a senior official for Indo-Pacific affairs on the White House National Security Council. It was fake news deliberately spread by the U.S. to discredit China, divert public attention and shift the blame.</p> <p> https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4777H2eyHqM</p> <p> ◆According to NBC News, U.S. intelligence officers released information about the Russia-Ukraine conflict even when it wasn't "rock solid", and some assertions, such as China considering providing military help to Russia, were made up. This shows the U.S. was taking preemptive action to win the "information war" against Russia.</p> <p> https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-using-declassified-intel-fight-info-war-russia-even-intel-isnt-rock-rcna23014</p> <p> ◆Speaking to the media on 22 March 2022, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan admitted that he had not seen any evidence of China providing military equipment to Russia.</p> <p> https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-has-not-seen-china-providing-military-equipment-russia-white-house-2022-03-22/</p> <p> ◆On March 30, 2022, Pentagon Spokesman John F. Kirby said that the United States sees no indications of Chinese military assistance to Russia.</p> <p> http://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2983648/pentagon-press-secretary-john-f-kirby-holds-a-press-briefing-march-30-2022/</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> Falsehood 2: The joint statement issued by China and Russia on 4 February this year provides evidence of China's support for Russia on the Ukraine issue. The joint statement is a "veiled support" for Russia's "invasion" of Ukraine.</p> <p> Reality Check: Last February, China issued joint statements with a number of leaders attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The U.S.'s interpretation of the China-Russia joint statement is out of context and part of a smear campaign.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> ◆During the Beijing Winter Olympics, many foreign leaders visited China. China issued joint statements with Kyrgyzstan, Argentina, Ecuador, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and other countries to express mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests and highlight joint efforts to uphold multilateralism.</p> <p> ◆In their joint statement, China and Russia call on all States to champion humanity's common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, respect the rights of peoples to independently determine the development paths of their countries and the sovereignty and the security and development interests of States, to protect the United Nations-centered international system, and the international law-based international order, seek true multilateralism with the United Nations and its Security Council playing a central and coordinating role, promote more democratic international relations, and ensure peace, stability and sustainable development across the world.</p> <p> ◆In the joint statement, China and Russia call for the establishment of a new model of major-country relations on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and reaffirm that the new inter-State relations between China and Russia are superior to military and political alliances of the Cold War era, and the strengthening of bilateral strategic cooperation is neither aimed against third countries nor affected by circumstantial changes in third countries or the changing international environment.</p> <p> ◆The China-Russia relationship features non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting at any third party. It differs from the practice of the US and a small number of other Western countries that stick to Cold War thinking and a friend-or-foe dichotomy to draw ideological lines, form so-called "alliances" and "cliques" and pursue bloc politics to create confrontation and division.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> Falsehood 3: China helps Russia spread disinformation that "the US owns biological weapons in Ukraine".</p> <p> Reality Check: The US is doing this for the purpose of diverting public attention. According to public information, the US has conducted more bio-military activities than any other country in the world. It is also the only country that has used biological and chemical weapons in multiple wars, and the only country that opposes the establishment of a multilateral verification mechanism for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), a public stand held by the US for more than two decades.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> ◆The US Department of Defense controls 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries. Inheriting the "devil's legacy" from the Unit 731, the notorious branch of the Japanese army during the war of aggression against China,the US conducted research and development of biological weapons at Fort Detrick. Despite the entry into force of the BWC in 1975, the US continued with such activities. For more than 20 years, it is the only country opposing the establishment of a multilateral verification mechanism for the BWC, claiming that "the traditional approach ... is not a workable structure for biological weapons" and "(the draft Protocol to the BWC) would put national security and confidential business information at risk". As a State Party to the BWC, the US is obliged to make clarifications on issues of concerns to the international community in accordance with Article V of the Convention.</p> <p> http://m.stdaily.com/guoji/xinwen/202203/c679761bfe7c44898178ee7ff0a271f1.shtml</p> <p> ◆In the working document submitted by the US to the meeting of the State Parties to the BWC in November 2021, the US admitted that it has 26 bio-labs in Ukraine. According to the fact sheet released by the US Department of Defense in March 2022,the US is supporting 46 facilities in Ukraine.</p> <p> https://meetings.unoda.org/section/bwc-msp-2020-documents/</p> <p> https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/11/2002954612/-1/-1/0/FACT-SHEET-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE'S-COOPERATIVE-THREAT-REDUCTION-PROGRAM-BIOLOGICAL-THREAT-REDUCTION-PROGRAM-ACTIVITIES-IN-UKRAINE.PDF</p> <p> ◆The Agreement Between the Department of Defense of the United States of America and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine Concerning Cooperation in the Area of Prevention of Proliferation of Technology, Pathogens and Expertise that could be Used in the Development of Biological Weapons signed by the two countries on 29 August 2005 clearly stipulates that the US Department of Defense representatives shall have the right to participate in all related activities at facilities in Ukraine; all dangerous pathogens in Ukraine shall be stored at designated laboratories; Ukraine shall share with the US data generated by the relevant surveillance network, transfer to the US side requested copies of dangerous pathogen strains, and withhold information designated by the US side as "sensitive" from public disclosure.</p> <p> https://dontspeaknews.com/2022/02/24/the-secret-us-bioweapons-labs-in-ukraine-and-georgia/</p> <p> https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/05-829-Ukraine-Weapons.pdf</p> <p> ◆On March 8, 2022, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland admitted at a Senate hearing that "Ukraine has biological research facilities, which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach."</p> <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydSf57SRtcQ</p> <p> ◆On March 10, 2022, Tucker Carlson, Fox News Channel host, said that the US government is funding secret bio-labs in Ukraine to conduct research on dangerous pathogens. According to him, the US government has repeatedly denied the claim, calling it Russian disinformation, and the American people have been lied to. But the US government official in charge of Ukraine has confirmed that the information about US funding bio-labs in Ukraine is simply true.</p> <p> https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tucker-the-pentagon-is-lying-about-bio-labs-in-ukraine</p> <p> ◆On March 18, 2022, Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva released an "investigative material" on US-Ukraine cooperation, revealing a substantial amount of details of biological research cooperation between the two countries. For example, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from public disclosure of sensitive information about the Pentagon's program for bio-labs; the Pentagon has been granted access to certain state secrets of Ukraine in connection with the projects under their agreement; and Ukraine is obliged to transfer to the US Department of Defense dangerous pathogens for biological research.</p> <p> http://news.cri.cn/2022-03-25/d8399086-f156-53eb-dec6-3a9a5dbf3164.html</p> <p> ◆William Scott Ritter, a former UN Weapons Inspector in Iraq and former US Marine Corps intelligence officer, said in an interview that "There is an absolute requirement for stringent confidence-building investigations into what the United States was doing (in the US-led bio labs in Ukraine), so that the world can be confident that the United States operates within the framework (of the BWC)".</p> <p> https://www.news.cn/world/2022-03/31/c_1128521601.htm</p> <p> ◆During the Korean War, the US military conducted covert germ-warfare operations in northern DPRK and some parts of northeast China. American planes dropped virus carriers such as insects and rats infected with yersinia pestis and vibrio cholerae. During the Vietnam War, the US sprayed about 20 million gallons of defoliant (toxic chemicals such as Agent Orange) in Vietnam, killing 400,000 Vietnamese and leaving 2 million suffering from cancer and other diseases.</p> <p> ◆The US has spread publicly or through US-funded NGOs disinformation on the use of chemical and biological weapons by Iraq and Syria. In an interview with Al Jazeera in 2011, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell admitted before the public that Iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons was false information. The US government has long been the main sponsor of the White Helmets, and has instructed the organization to release multiple fake videos of the Syrian government using chemical weapons.</p> <p> http://www.aljazeera.com.com/amp/news/2021/10/18/stain-on-powells-record-lies-to-the-un-about-iraqs-weapons</p> <p> http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/1119/c90000-9922089</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> Falsehood 4: China amplifies Russian propaganda by claiming that "the US and NATO caused the Ukraine crisis".</p> <p> Reality Check:People of insight in the international community have publicly warned many times about the possible repercussions of the US continuous push for NATO's eastward expansion.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> ◆In 1990, then US Secretary of State James Baker, during his meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, promised clearly that NATO will move "not one inch eastward". However, under the domination of the United States, NATO has expanded eastward five times since 1999, increased its membership from 16 to 30, and advanced more than 1,000 kilometers eastward right up to Russian borders, creating a C-shaped encirclement of the Black Sea.</p> <p> ◆A document disclosed by the National Archives of Great Britain showed that the US representative had promised in negotiations back then that NATO should not expand to the east either formally or unofficially.</p> <p> https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2022-02-18-spiegel--the-west-in-a-1991-document-declared-the-unacceptability-of-nato-expansion-to-the-east.r1bJ_VK6kq.html</p> <p> ◆Russia has for years proposed dialogue with the United States on a European Security Initiative, only to be ignored by the US side. In 2021, Russia offered multiple times to negotiate and sign a peace agreement with NATO, but was rejected by the United States and NATO.</p> <p> ◆The United States and NATO, while fully aware of Russia's security concerns, strengthened military assistance to Ukraine and helped it train military personnel.</p> <p> According to US media reports, former US officials said that the United States has provided a large amount of advanced military training for Ukrainian elite troops and special operation forces. Since 2015, the CIA has conducted a series of intensive military training in Ukraine involving guns, land navigation and camouflage techniques. The program, which began under President Obama, was expanded under President Trump and further enlarged under the Biden administration.</p> <p> According to Canadian media reports, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has spent more than 890 million US dollars on training Ukrainian soldiers since 2014, including more than 30,000 Ukrainian troops trained in Zolochiv between February 2019 and February 2022.</p> <p> https://world.huanqiu.com/article/47Zcn5zwlLa</p> <p> ◆On April 12, 2022, UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey confirmed that the British military would train Ukrainian soldiers in the UK.</p> <p> https://3w.huanqiu.com/a/9eda3d/47ajbHTJ5hS?agt=8</p> <p> https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ukrainian-soldiers-arrive-uk-days-26692082</p> <p> ◆The CIA has long been training members of the "Azov Battalion" in a secret place in southern United States. Since 2014, the United States and Ukraine have consistently voted against draft resolutions on combating "neo-Nazism" at the United Nations. In 2015, the House of Representatives of the US Congress lifted the ban on funding the "Azov Battalion" and provided a large amount of military assistance to Ukraine. A report released in 2018 by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank,said that the "Azov Battalion" was among the recipients of weapons and equipment provided by the United States to Ukraine.</p> <p> ◆Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in an op-ed published in The Washington Post in 2014 that "far too often the Ukrainian issue is posed as a showdown: whether Ukraine joins the East or the West. But if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side's outpost against the other - it should function as a bridge between them."</p> <p> https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/henry-kissinger-to-settle-the-ukraine-crisis-start-at-the-end/2014/03/05/46dad868-a496-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html</p> <p> ◆George Kennan, late American diplomat and observer of the Soviet Union, wrote in The New York Times in 1997 that "expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era".</p> <p> https://world.huanqiu.com/article/46wKCk9TxKL</p> <p> ◆Former US Senator Bill Bradley said that "the fundamental blunder that the United States made in the late 80s, early 90s was the expansion of NATO".</p> <p> https://ms-my.facebook.com/Progressives4DenRep/videos/bill-bradley-says-nato-expansion-unnecessary-in-2008/4799246893521243/</p> <p> ◆John Mearsheimer, an American political scientist, pointed out that "the West bears primary responsibility of what is happening today. It was largely a result of a decision in April 2006 to make Ukraine and to make Georgia part of NATO". He said, "Here I'm talking about the West, we took a stick and we poke the bear in the eye ... and that bear is not going to smile and laugh at what you are doing. That bear is probably going to fight back, and that's exactly what's happening here."</p> <p> https://m.guancha.cn/MiErSiHaiMo/2022_03_12_629948.shtml</p> <p> ◆In an New York Times article on February 21, 2022, Thomas Friedman pointed out that the United States and NATO were not innocent bystanders in the Ukraine crisis, and that the decision of the United States on NATO expansion has added a "huge log" to the conflict in Ukraine.</p> <p> https://www.chinanews.com.cn/gj/2022/03-06/9693915.shtml</p> <p> ◆In a speech on February 28, 2022, US Senator Bernie Sanders cited the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis as an example, saying that the Kennedy administration considered the Soviet Union's deployment of missiles in Cuba 90 miles from the US coast to be an unacceptable threat to US national security. He questioned if anyone really believe that the United States would not have something to say if Mexico, Cuba, or any country in Central or Latin America want to form a military alliance with a US adversary, and that members of Congress would stand up and say, 'well, you know, Mexico is an independent country, and they have the right to do anything they want'"?</p> <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydL3cHVyRNc</p> <p> ◆Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview if Joe Biden simply promised not to include Ukraine into NATO, the war would have been prevented.</p> <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4</p> <p> ◆After the World War II, "proxy wars" became a major option for the United States to intervene in the affairs of other countries. The Ukraine crisis manipulated by the United States and NATO is a "proxy war." Former UK parliamentarian George Galloway said the United States is prepared to let Ukraine fight to the last drop of its blood.</p> <p> https://chinese.cri.cn/2022/04/14/ARTIe6oeOKMflgc2uBcYy97H220414.shtml?spm=C09605.PYGuJ2ZGcYXi.S86169.5</p> <p> ◆Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview with the CNN that there are countries in NATO that want the Ukraine crisis to continue, they see the continuation of the crisis as weakening Russia, and they don't care much about the situation in Ukraine.</p> <p> https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/04/21/Turkey-s-FM-says-some-NATO-allies-want-longer-Ukraine-war-to-weaken-Russia</p> <p> ◆Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois in the United States, said that the fundamental problem of the Russia-Ukraine conflict lies in the constant eastward expansion of the US-led NATO. Biden should publicly announce that Ukraine will not join NATO and NATO will not expand, which may lead to a breakthrough in the current situation.</p> <p> http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202203/28/WS62414e32a310fd2b29e53b05.html</p> <p> ◆On April 11, 2022, Martin Jacques, a well-known UK scholar, said that the current situation in Ukraine is a product of the United States' Cold War mentality and continued promotion of NATO expansion. It has pushed not only Ukraine but the whole of Europe to the frontline of US-Russia confrontation.</p> <p> https://tv.cctv.com/2022/04/12/VIDEbVFLVHLQn1SyN1m4RWxr220412.shtml</p> <p> ◆Kishore Mahbubani, founding dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, pointed out that the tragedy of the Ukraine conflict is that the armed conflict could and should have been prevented, and that the decisions on NATO expansion were driven by the short-term interests of US domestic politics.</p> <p> https://china-environment-news.com/2022/03/23/ukraine-war-where-are-the-peacemakers/</p> <p> ◆Spanish political analyst Manolo Monereo said that the Ukraine conflict has been dominated by the US all along, while its European allies only play their role as a part of NATO.</p> <p> https://www.elviejotopo.com/topoexpress/ucrania-y-la-gran-transicion-geopolitica-y-civilizatoria/</p> <p> ◆Yunus Sonnell, a Turkish expert on international issues, said that on the surface, the crisis broke out between Russia and Ukraine, but its root lies in the attempt by the US to maintain the unipolar international order as the global hegemonic power, and to squeeze Russia's living space through NATO's eastward expansion.</p> <p> https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?item_id=8024464082319901938</p> <p> https://www.archyde.com/turkish-expert-on-international-affairs-ukrainian-crisis-is-rooted-in-u-s-hegemony-russian-ukrainian-foreign-ministers-meeting-is-a-positive-attempt-to-resolve-the-crisis-through-diplomatic-means_/</p> <p> ◆South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region.</p> <p> https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/safricas-ramaphosa-blames-nato-russias-war-ukraine-2022-03-17</p> <p> https://7news.com.au/news/conflict/nato-could-have-avoided-war-south-africa-c-6107191</p> <p> ◆Doraisamy Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, pointed out in an Indian Express article that the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine is rooted in the expansionary logic of the military alliance-NATO.</p> <p> https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/nato-is-a-danger-to-world-peace-it-must-go-russia-ukraine-world-war-soviet-union-7854544/</p> <p> ◆In 1992 when then Russian President Boris Yeltsin paid his first visits to China and the United States following the Soviet disintegration, the countries agreed not to regard each other as adversaries, which basically put Russia's bilateral relations with China and the United States on the same level. Over the past thirty years, the China-Russia relationship has made great progress, but it is still based on non-alliance, non-confrontation, and non-targeting of third countries. At the same time, US-Russia relations are sliding into a new Cold War.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> Falsehood 5: China is trying to deflect attention by claiming that "the United States, especially US defense contractors, are the biggest beneficiary of the Ukraine crisis" .</p> <p> Reality Check: It is an indisputable fact that the US military enterprises have raked in huge profits since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> ◆Since tensions surrounding Ukraine started to rise in October 2021, share prices of US military giants have shot up. Over the past six months, Lockheed Martin's shares have grown by about 35%, while those of Northrop Grumman gained 27% and Raytheon by 14.5%. James Taiclet, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said that the competition between major powers would bring more business to the company.</p> <p> http://tv.cctv.com/2022/03/26/VIDE7O6P9UbKyW37zBGyXTZt220326.shtml</p> <p> ◆According to the report Trends in International Arms Transfer published on March 14, 2022 by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the volume of international transfers of major arms in 2017-21 was 4.6 percent lower than in 2012-16.

In April, spring plowing started in only 30 to 50 percent of the planned area, which means 50 million tons of global grain supplies will be affected.</p> <p> https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/</p> <p> https://en.mercopress.com/2022/03/23/ukraine-anticipates-spring-crops-cut-by-half-only-7-out-of-15-million-hectares-were-sown</p> <p> ◆According to the first research report on US sanctions against Russia released by the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, the all-out US sanctions against Russia have had a serious negative impact on the world, including Europe and Russia, leading to global inflation, supply chain shocks, and slowdown of economic recovery.</p> <p> http://www.rdcy.org/index/index/news_cont/id/693192.html</p> <p> ◆Gita Gopinath, the Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, said that financial sanctions imposed on Russia would gradually dilute the US dollar's dominance, which might to some extent fragment the international monetary system.</p> <p> https://www.businesstoday.in/crypto/story/gita-gopinath-says-sanctions-on-russia-will-boost-crypto-reduce-dollar-dominance-328258-2022-04-01</p> <p> ◆Greek international law expert Sarigiannidis said that "The Western governments do not need a Russian people that would demonize the West.

The "democracy vs autocracy" narrative produced by the United States on the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a perfect example of its Cold War mentality.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> ◆On April 1, 2022, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore said during his dialogue with the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board that "on US-China, it is one of the things which will be complicated by Ukraine. America asks why China does not stand with it. You have to be very careful not to define the problem with Ukraine in such a way that automatically, China is already on the wrong side, for example, by making this a battle of democracies against autocracies".</p> <p> https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/singapore/story20220410-1261411</p> <p> https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-Hsien-Loong-at-the-Dialogue-with-Wall-Street-Journal-Editorial-Board-Apr-2022</p> <p> ◆In an article published on the website of East Asia Forum on December 7, 2021, Baogang He, Professor and Chair of International Relations at Deakin University, wrote, "...framing US-China strategic competition in terms of democracy versus autocracy is a poor strategy. It will intensify global polarization and fuel geopolitical competition at a time when international solidarity is desperately needed to deal with climate change and other shared challenges. The democracy-versus-autocracy framework provides a poor foundation for the 'new Cold War' between the United States and China."</p> <p> https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/12/07/bidens-misguided-framing-of-us-china-rivalry-as-democracy-versus-autocracy/</p> <p> ◆ In the name of "spreading democracy", the United States promoted the "Neo-Monroe Doctrine" in Latin America, incited "color revolutions" in Eurasia, and directed from behind the scenes the "Arab Spring" in West Asia and North Africa, bringing chaos and disasters to many countries and seriously undermining world peace and stability. Now, again in the name of "democracy", the United States is actually dividing the international community, creating division, and undermining the progress toward greater democracy in international relations.</p> <p> ◆In May 2021, the Latana polling company of Germany and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation (founded by Anders Rasmussen, former Prime Minister of Denmark and NATO Secretary General) released a Democracy Perception Index Report 2021, which is based on a survey conducted among over 50,000 respondents in 53 countries. According to the report, 44 percent of the respondents are concerned that the United States threatens democracy in their country.</p> <p> ◆ Shakeel Ramay, Chief Executive Officer of the Asian Institute of Eco-civilization Research and Development, wrote that "The West has launched a campaign to show solidarity with Ukraine. The slogans of sovereignty, human rights and a rule-based global system are back in business. The West is trying to act as a staunch protector of values, human rights and sovereignty. It is skillfully crafting a campaign and a narrative, which suits its geo-political and geo-economic agenda."</p> <p> http://news.gmw.cn/2022-03/18/content_35594961.htm</p> <p> ◆US filmmaker Oliver Stone said in an interview that the essence of US democracy is money politics. The United States has styled itself as the model of democracy, yet it is willfully violating international rules and creating division. When it takes 14 billion dollars to elect a president, you wonder what kind of democracy it is. You can't even get a congressman to talk to you unless you pay or you have a business interest. The US government is "totally corrupt".</p> <p> https://english.cctv.com/2021/12/06/VIDEQlgxOv8kQsqvgrWatpqU211206.shtml</p> <p> ◆US Congressman Mo Brooks has revealed that chairmanships of major committees of the US Congress must be purchased, with the price, charged by both parties, depending on the importance of the committee and a minimum bid of one million US dollars. Special interest groups run Washington, and public policy debates are very corrupt, which is an important reason why the US government has been unable to respond effectively to many challenges.</p> <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7esevHM5l3A</p> <p> ◆Winners of 91 percent of US congressional elections are candidates with greater financial support. Ordinary voters are wooed only when their votes are wanted. They are ignored once the election is over. The flaws of the electoral system are all too obvious. For instance, gerrymandering, the prevailing practice of redrawing electoral districts, undermines fairness and justice.</p> <p> Falsehood 11: Ukraine today would become Taiwan tomorrow. If the Chinese mainland "pursues reunification with Taiwan by force", the United States will impose sanctions on China just as it did on Russia, and China will face severe consequences.</p> <p> Reality check: The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are different in nature. The Taiwan question is a legacy of the Chinese civil war. Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Taiwan question is entirely China's internal affair.</p> <p> ◆A total of 181 countries, including the United States, have established and developed diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle. But while stressing respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity on Ukraine, the United States has blatantly trampled on the red line of the one-China principle on the Taiwan question. This is nothing but sheer double standard.</p> <p> ◆In 1943, leaders of China, the United Kingdom and the United States issued the Cairo Declaration, stating clearly that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. In 1945, the Potsdam Declaration reiterated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out. All this shows unequivocally that in the international community, there is no controversy at all regarding China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan.</p> <p> ◆In October 1971, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, which decided to restore the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China at the UN. The resolution resolved the issue of China's UN representation in political, legal and procedural terms once and for all. The official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat clearly stated that "the United Nations considers 'Taiwan' as a province of China with no separate status", "authorities in Taipei are not considered to ... enjoy any form of governmental status", and that the region should be referred to as "Taiwan, Province of China".</p> <p> ◆The one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques constitute the political foundation of China-US relations. In 1971, the United States declared that it "acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China", that it would not repeat the phrase that the status of Taiwan is undetermined, and that it had not supported and would not support movements for "Taiwan independence". President Richard Nixon affirmed the above principles to Premier Zhou Enlai during his visit to China in 1972.</p> <p> ◆In the Joint Communique of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America (the Shanghai Communique) signed on February 27, 1972, the United States declared that it "acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The US government does not challenge that position" and that it "affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all US forces and military installations from Taiwan. In the meantime, it will progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes".</p> <p> ◆In the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America (the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations) signed on December 16, 1978, the United States stated that it "recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. Within this context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan" and that "[t]he government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China".</p> <p> ◆In the Joint Communique between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America signed on August 17, 1982 (the August 17 Communique), the United States reiterated that "it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China's internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan'" and that "it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution".</p> <p> ◆Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, successive US administrations have promised to abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques. However, not long after establishing diplomatic ties with China, the United States passed the so-called "Taiwan Relations Act", followed by an internal offer of "Six Assurances" to Taiwan, both in breach of US commitments made in the three joint communiques, and the one-China principle established by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and widely observed by the international community. Hence they are illegal and void from the very beginning.</p> <p> ◆For some time now, the United States has been bending, changing and back-peddling on its commitment on the Taiwan question in terms of its words and deeds, trying to hollow out the one-China principle.</p> <p> Politically, the United States has introduced a number of Taiwan-related acts and raised the level of engagement with Taiwan. In 2018, then US President Donald Trump signed the "Taiwan Travel Act", encouraging high-level visits between US and Taiwan officials. The "US Consolidated Appropriations Act 2022" asks the administration to distinguish Taiwan from the mainland of China when making maps of China, a flagrant challenge to the one-China principle.</p> <p> Military-wise, the United States has never stopped selling arms to Taiwan, and has frequently sent warships through the Taiwan Strait. Since 1979, the United States has delivered 107 rounds of arms sales to Taiwan, including offensive weapons such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy torpedoes and F-16V fighters. Under the Trump presidency, US arms sales to Taiwan totaled nearly 20 billion US dollars. Just over a year in office, the Biden administration has announced three rounds of arms sales to Taiwan. In 2020, US warships sailed through the Taiwan Strait 13 times, the highest record in 14 years.</p> <p> Internationally, the United States has worked to help Taiwan expand its so-called "international space". In October 2021, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement that the United States encourages all UN members to join it in supporting Taiwan's active and meaningful participation in the UN system and the international community, and invited Taiwan to the so-called "Leaders' Summit for Democracy" hosted by the United States. All other participants to the summit were sovereign states.</p> <p> ◆Under the current US administration, a number of US congressmen and former political leaders have visited Taiwan. In August 2020, then US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar visited Taiwan. In September 2020, then US Under Secretary of State Keith Krach visited Taiwan. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed a delegation of former senior defense and security officials to Taiwan. Soon after that, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Taiwan. The United States also planned a visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives. A bipartisan US congressional delegation headed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez visited Taiwan, which triggered much media hype-up by the "Taiwan independence" forces. What the United States has done is a malicious provocation against China's sovereignty and gross interference in China's internal affairs, and will send out an extremely dangerous political signal.</p> <p> ◆The US "Indo-Pacific strategy" is becoming a byword for bloc politics. From strengthening the Five Eyes to peddling the Quad, from putting together AUKUS to tightening bilateral military alliances, the United States is staging a "five-four-three-two" formation in the Asia-Pacific, aiming at an Indo-Pacific version of NATO and a repeat of "Ukraine crisis" in Asia.</p> <p> ◆The US attempts for breakthroughs on the Taiwan question show no regard to the common will of the UN membership embodied in Resolution 2758, contravene the consensus of the international community, undermine the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and jeopardize peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p> <p> China must be reunified and will definitely be reunified. The Chinese side will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and efforts. That said, should the "Taiwan Independence" forces make provocations, force our hands or even cross the red line, China will be compelled to take resolute measures.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291627000231064255975.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 480px;" /></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>Graphic/People's Daily Online</em></p> <p> A shooter. A gun. A train of helpless commuters. In what should be a rush-hour nightmare on the NYC subway on April 12, Gerard Baker saw something different. The renowned Wall Street Journal columnist diagnosed the Brooklyn subway attack as an emblem of the "failure of American government at all levels." The failure, as he elaborated in his opinion piece headlined <em>A Crime Scene Where the Victims Wore Masks</em>, has permeated everything: from the mask mandate to law enforcement to the border crisis…</p> <p> Except for one thing: gun control.</p> <p> Ignoring the gun issue in a gun violence incident is ridiculous enough, and it is equally absurd that mask-wearing had to bear the onus at a crime scene. But sadly, such an attitude falls in line with the popular belief shared by a significant number of Americans, that "excessive" mask mandates are somehow more noxious to society than an excessive number of guns. It reflects a disturbing anomaly in today's America, where, even during a pandemic, guns are viewed as a necessity while masks are treated as a liability.</p> <p> Too many guns have always been a perennial problem in American society, which has gradually explored its own way of "living with guns"—defending firearms with more firearms. On average, one hundred Americans own some 120.5 guns, according to available data published by the Small Arms Survey, which estimated that 81.4 million Americans who possess (393 million) guns make up about 46% of the world's total civilian firearms ownership.</p> <p> America's superabundance of civilian-held guns is a problem of its own making. Gun shops in the US are so omnipresent that they outnumber Starbucks, McDonald's and grocery stores combined, according to Statista. With lax and counteractive federal and state laws as well as loose background checks, buying a lethal weapon in America is so easy that "it doesn't make sense," as former US president Barack Obama once declared.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291630000171159557858.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 601px;" /></p> <p> <em>Guns are on display at the Dallas Gun Show in Parker, a suburban city of Dallas, Texas, the United States, Jan. 22, 2022. (Photo by Lin Li/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> During the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans' gun hoarding habit has grown out of control. Forbes reported that Americans bought 19.9 million firearms last year, the second-highest year only after 2020, which saw a record-setting of 22.8 million purchases of firearms. "There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic," said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, an American politician.</p> <p> Accompanying the surging gun sales is the soaring number of gun violence incidents: both gun-related suicides and homicides have spiked in the US. Between March 01, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the US saw a 30% upsurge in nationwide gun violence rates, according to a report published in Nature. In 2020 alone, 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US, of which 54% were suicide deaths, 611 people died from mass shootings and 19,508 from gun-related homicide or murder (In 2021, all of these numbers continued to climb).</p> <p> Racism-driven shootings (e.g., 2021 Atlanta spa shootings) and indiscriminate mass shootings (such as the Brooklyn subway shooting), among other gruesome gun-related homicides, occur so often that they almost make America's gun crisis sound like a cliché, receiving a period of attention that is so short-lived that hardly has the next gun tragedy arrives that the previous one starts to fade away from the public's radar. So much so that Americans and the global audience have already developed their immunity to the "horrifying shooting—crying for gun control—political impasse—more horrifying shooting" vicious circle.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291649000526489401587.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>A sign reminding passengers to wear face masks is seen on the window of a subway train in Chicago, the United States, on Feb. 28, 2022. (Photo by Vincent D. Johnson/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> Masks, on the other hand, have faced a totally different fate in American society. Their very existence has come under serious doubts and "life-threatening" challenges since the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed almost one million Americans.</p> <p> They survived two American presidents: Trump mocked the act of mask-wearing and refused to wear one until July 2020; Biden prematurely dropped the mask mandate for vaccinated people briefly before another surge of cases hit the US.</p> <p> They were rendered useless in states like Florida and Texas, belittled as ineffective by politicians, including US senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, and portrayed by popular media outlets such as the FOX News as something that can achieve nothing, but are attacks on the public's "liberty" and "freedom."</p> <p> Finally, on April 18, a Florida judge struck down the federal mask mandate on airplanes and other public transit systems. At a time when only 66% of Americans are fully vaccinated, a rate far below the number needed for optimal herd immunity, and with daily averages still above 50,000 new cases, the ruling has invited grave concerns and criticisms. "The science on masking did not change (with the ruling)," wrote Aaron E. Carroll, a public health expert, in a New York Times article. He added that the reason why several governors and businesses didn't hesitate to abandon mask requirements (even long before the ruling) is that "these groups have interests that compete with science."</p> <p> Despite their treatments being poles apart, guns and masks point to the exact same crisis management mechanism in the US, where one group's liberty takes precedence over the whole society's safety, where science and expertise yield to political or business interests, where saving more lives isn't as convincing to some politicians as saving more votes. In such an upended reality, it's hard to fathom when enough will finally be enough.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

According to statistics released by the World Health Organization, artemisinin has save millions of lives since artemisinin-based drugs were promoted globally as antimalarials. More than 240 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have benefited from artemisinin treatment, and about 1.5 million patients have escaped death thanks to this treatment.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0429/FOREIGN202204291053000556323044209.jpg" style="width: 832px; height: 578px;" /></p> <p> <em>Chinese herbal expert Tu Youyou wins the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for her contributions to malaria treatment, Oct. 5, 2015.</em></p> <p> The story of artemisinin mirrors the mutual assistance offered by China and other developing countries.</p> <p> As a result of China's success in eradicating malaria at home, it has also launched large foreign-aid programs to help other countries prevent the disease with artemisinin.</p> <p> By the end of 2021, China had provided billions of doses of artemisinin medicines, trained tens of thousands of anti-malaria professionals for developing countries, assisted in the construction of malaria prevention and treatment centers for 30 countries, and sent 28,000 medical team members to 72 developing countries for malaria prevention and treatment. These concrete actions have made important contributions to the global efforts in preventing and treating malaria.</p> <p> Thanks to a China-aided malaria elimination program, the number of malaria cases has dropped by 98 percent in Comoros, while deaths from the infection have been eliminated.</p> <p> Senegalese President Macky Sall noted that it was because of the support from China and other partners that his country has achieved remarkable progress in the prevention and control of malaria.</p> <p> The story of artemisinin mirrors China's efforts to benefit the world with its own development.</p> <p> Humanity is a community with a shared future. Solidarity and cooperation remain the most powerful weapons against global and regional public health challenges. Be it joining hands with the rest of the world to combat malaria, or joining international cooperation in the fight against SARS, bird flu, Ebola and COVID-19, China has always been giving a helping hand to other countries to tide over difficulties.</p> <p> Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has carried out its largest emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It has provided hundreds of billions of anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations and supplied 2.1 billion doses of vaccine to more than 120 countries and international organizations. It is making COVID-19 vaccines an accessible and affordable public product for developing countries.</p> <p> From eliminating major infectious diseases such as malaria, to promoting international cooperation on the fight against COVID-19, China has always put people and their lives in the first place, which is responsible for not only the health and lives of the Chinese, but also the global public health cause. With concrete actions, the country is practicing the vision of building a global community of health for all and building a powerful joint force for the world to fight COVID-19.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> As the spillovers&nbsp;of the Ukraine crisis continue to spread, the international situation is increasingly complex and grave. The U.S., the&nbsp;instigator of the&nbsp;crisis, has neither reflected on its mistakes nor done its duty for world peace and security by trying all means to promote a ceasefire and peace talks.</p> <p> Instead, it has continued to fan the flames of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and made it more difficult to achieve reconciliation. The country even attempts to shift the blame for its mistakes onto others and has willfully smeared and attacked China, sowing misunderstanding, antagonism, and insecurity in the Asia-Pacific region.</p> <p> Remarks and acts of the U.S. regarding the Ukraine crisis, including spreading lies to create the illusion that China is responsible for the crisis and attempting to bracket the Taiwan question and the Ukraine crisis together to seek an excuse for using Taiwan to contain China, won’t do any good to the settlement of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but will further undermine mutual trust and cooperation between China and the U.S.</p> <p> “The U.S. has kept stirring up trouble and only pursued ‘coercive&nbsp;diplomacy’ to make other countries pay for its mistakes and suppress China. Obviously, the U.S. hasn’t learned anything from its wrong foreign policy in the past and still views the world with the friend-enemy binary logic,” pointed out Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies.</p> <p> Washington’s actions on the Ukraine crisis have proven that creating confrontation is the essence of the current U.S. policy toward China, according to Diao Daming, a research fellow with the National Academy of Development and Strategy, Renmin University of China.</p> <p> “By using the Russia-Ukraine conflict to create division in the world, the U.S. attempts to cast China as a ‘common threat’ to the West so as to enlist its allies in confrontation with China at minimal cost, thus maintaining its hegemony and interests,” said Diao.</p> <p> Such moves of the U.S. have exposed the country’s Cold War mentality and the wrong approach it has taken in dealing with its relations with China.</p> <p> Some people in the U.S. hope to spawn a “new Cold War” with China, and regard&nbsp;the cultivation of a shared enemy as the necessary key to maintaining the so-called “liberal order”, said Peter&nbsp;Isackson, chief strategy officer of Fair Observer, an independent, nonprofit media organization in the U.S., in his recent article published on the website of Fair Observer.</p> <p> According to the article, these people believe the fear of “enemy” can divert American people’s attention from serious and worsening problems at home, such as income inequality and an enduring pandemic punctuated by contestable government mandates.</p> <p> Some in the U.S. oppose the U.S. policy of engagement with China because they object to the loss of American global and regional preeminence and the inability of the U.S. to have its way unilaterally, which is “narrow-minded and short-sighted”, pointed out Chas W. Freeman, Jr., former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs.</p> <p> U.S. politicians’ fear-mongering over China and hyping the China threat will make the U.S.-China relations harder to manage, according to Andrew&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Nathan, a professor of Political Science at Columbia University.</p> <p> Major countries in the world are supposed to shoulder major responsibilities for safeguarding international peace and security.</p> <p> The U.S. must abandon its wrong approach, return to a rational and pragmatic policy toward China and show its sense of responsibility by working together with China to steer the China-U.S. relations back on the right track at an early date.</p> <p> Last year, bilateral trade between China and the U.S. exceeded $750 billion for the first time, and two-way investment between the two countries jumped to nearly $240 billion. Meanwhile, more than 70,000 American enterprises made investments in China.</p> <p> Facts have fully demonstrated that the interests of China and the U.S. are deeply entwined, ideological differences can’t define the relations between the two countries, and the U.S. waging a “new Cold War” on China despite opposition would harm both China and itself.</p> <p> The move to contain China will further divide the U.S. from its partners and undermine the reputation of the U.S., thus constituting an act of self-destruction, according to G. John Ikenberry, who is the Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University.</p> <p> The Asia-Pacific region is not a wrestling ground for international politics. For a long time, the U.S. has attempted to create tensions and incite confrontation and&nbsp;antagonism in the region by pushing its Indo-Pacific strategy, arousing widespread concerns among countries in the region.</p> <p> Countries in the Asia-Pacific region share the general desire to prevent the resurgence of the Cold War mentality and refuse to take sides between major powers.</p> <p> “All countries in the world want a positive and constructive relationship with both the U.S. and China,” said former Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, whose view is echoed by many.</p> <p> Competition among major countries is not the theme of the times, and zero-sum game is not the right choice. Now that the world has emerged from the Cold War, it should not suffer from a new Iron Curtain.</p> <p> The U.S. should shoulder its responsibilities as a major country and respond to the international community’s expectations by returning to a rational and pragmatic policy toward China and working together with the latter to bring the bilateral relations back on the right track.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> Liz Truss, UK Foreign Secretary, delivered what the Financial Times described as a "hawkish set-piece" speech at a banquet in London on Wednesday. Her target was China. She said "NATO must have a global outlook," and "needs to preempt threats in the Indo-Pacific." Then she bluntly pointed out that they "must ensure that democracies like Taiwan are able to defend themselves." It's fair to say that Truss' remarks are the most blatant and ambitious statements among those made by US and Western politicians for a while about "the globalization of NATO."</p> <p> It's reported that Truss' remarks came as NATO members were discussing the bloc's new "strategic concept." There is a fierce debate among NATO countries over how much emphasis should be placed on the "security threat" posed by China in the Indo-Pacific region. On the same day, the US Indo-Pacific Commander said that NATO is a "pretty good model" for the Indo-Pacific region, for those nations that value freedom. People have become very familiar with such pattern of the US and the UK echoing each other.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some politicians in the US and the West have been constantly distorting facts, deliberately linking the Russia-Ukraine conflict to the Taiwan question in an attempt to play the "Taiwan card" to contain China. Truss took advantage of the Ukraine crisis to hype the "China threat" as early as before the conflict broke out. She "warned" that China could use the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an opportunity to launch aggression of its own in the Indo-Pacific. Even former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating harshly criticized her as being "demented" and suffering "illusions of grandeur."</p> <p> There is indeed frenzy in British foreign policy right now because of the Ukraine crisis. The UK, which has already left the EU and has a "special relationship" with the US, thinks it has a more flexible position than the US and the EU, and often parrots words very "conscientiously," saying and doing things that are inconvenient for Washington and at times being even more aggressive. Some politicians in London now increasingly see this as a source of uniqueness and superiority. The more they do this, the more they seem to feel the lingering warmth of the UK's prior status as "The Empire on which the sun never set."</p> <p> Although after Brexit, the UK sees "Global Britain" as its strategic goal, hoping that the UK can become a leading country across the world. But over the years, the so-called Global Britain only seems to cling more tightly to the US. Truss claimed she would become the "modern-day Thatcher," but she only looks like the head of the US State Department's London office. Since taking office as the UK Foreign Secretary, Truss has pointed her fingers at China on almost all major China-related issues, including the Taiwan question and Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues. She has followed Washington's lead. And the pragmatism of diplomacy that the British used to talk about has increasingly descended into opportunism and radicalism. In Washington's redeployment of the global system, the UK is increasingly willing to be a "pebble."</p> <p> Last July, the UK sent its Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier to the South China Sea, but it needed fighter jets and warships from Italy to make a fleet. In late March, during Truss' visit to India, she tried to persuade India not to buy Russian oil, but Indian's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar defended India's purchase of discounted Russian oil. "If you look at the major buyers of oil and gas from Russia, I think you'll find most of them are in Europe," Jaishankar said, refusing the unreasonable demand of the UK.</p> <p> Even as their own strengths continued to decline, some British and American politicians began to fantasize about "mind control" - namely to re-establish the global "superiority" of Anglo-Saxon civilization. Truss herself does not hide this, calling on Britain in a speech last year to stop the guilt about colonial history and instead be proud of its identity and status. This is why it is not surprising that although UK politicians have recently taken turns to win over India, emphasizing the special relationship between the UK and India and praising India with all kinds of nice words, the domestic response to this in India has been mediocre. Indians say that the UK still adopts a colonial mentality toward India.</p> <p> In fact, India is hardly the only country that has seen through this. More and more countries have recognized the nature of a series of small-circle activities carried out by the UK and the US in the name of the so-called common values and the culture that prioritizes Anglo Saxons. Truss and her ilk attempt to bring NATO to Asia and try to destabilize the Pacific, but they are doomed to fail. Treating China as a "systemic competitor" is also definitely a big misjudgment in the "Global Britain" strategy.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Global Times</p> ]]></full-text>

In a discussion he had with the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in early 1990s, then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker gave the “not one inch eastward”assurance about NATO expansion. However, the U.S.-led NATO broke this promise, engaging in a five-round eastward expansion of more than 1,000 kilometers toward the Russian border and increasing the number of its members from 16 to 30, pushing Russia into a corner with each step.</p> <p> In 1997, George Kennan, the former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, stated that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era. Now, this prediction has come true. The Ukraine crisis has brought about immeasurable impact to the world. However, NATO is still stuck in a Cold War mentality, and continues to add fuel to the fire and create division and confrontation.</p> <p> The key to close the “Pandora’s box” is in the hands of the U.S. and NATO. They should soberly reflect on their disgraceful roles in the Ukraine crisis, and assume their due responsibility.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Related reading:</strong></p> <p> <strong><a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0426/c90000-10089467.html" target="_blank">Role of NATO after end of Cold War: Pawn for U.S. in seeking hegemony</a></strong></p> <p> <strong><a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0427/c90000-10089894.html" target="_blank">Roles of NATO after end of Cold War: Cancer cells of international conflicts</a></strong></p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> News about Elon Musk's Twitter takeover has sparked continuous heated discussions in the US recently. The focus of some, however, has apparently been off the track. A New York Times reporter tweeted to question whether Twitter would become one of the platforms Beijing will gain leverage over in the future. It was re-tweeted and commented on by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. There are also voices saying that Musk will have to seek a balance between his support for free speech and his business activities in China, and that China will exert influence on Twitter through Musk.</p> <p> Many American media outlets didn't forget to "remind" people of the fact that Musk once "praised" China, and he encouraged people to visit China and see for themselves. At a critical moment when China and the US were locked in trade frictions in 2019, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory kicked into production. In merely over a year, Shanghai-made Teslas have accounted for more than half of Tesla's global delivery. Musk has dealt a lot with China and spoke out some truths about China's economy, they are regarded as "original sins" of Musk by some Americans. Many link Musk's Twitter deal with China and raise it to the level of "risks" or "threats", which shows how narrow the room for pragmatism and rationality toward China in the US has become. Similar incidents have become common in the US. Making an issue of China in every possible way has already become an "American disease." In the face of China's growing comprehensive national power that is closing the gap with the US', the confidence of many political elites in Washington has been declining. And these people are showing anxiety and over-sensitivity toward China, not letting go of any opportunity to hype the "China threat" theory. After Musk acquired Twitter, some from American media even urged Musk to cut off his business ties with China to "guarantee freedom of speech." Such extreme overbearingness hilariously overlaps their weakness.</p> <p> An interesting phenomenon is that many China security-related discussions contain various "private interests" if you look at them closely. Some businesspeople, such as George Soros, blamed China for their failure due to their wrong investment decisions in China. Others try to show their allegiance to the US. For example, Bezos often stresses security with a high-profile patriotic posture, but what he actually eyes are Pentagon orders that are highly profitable. More lawmakers and politicians touch on the China topic in an exaggerated and forcible way, through which they attack opponents as "weak." The "China Threat" is becoming a tacit business approach or a code to seek attention.</p> <p> From the national perspective, Sinophobia which is currently rampant in American society is not fundamentally different from "Japanophobia" that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s. In both cases, the US regards a "chaser" as competitor, on which the US tried to suppress by any means to ensure its own competitive advantage. But the end of the story will be different because there is no way that Washington can overwhelm China in the same way that it coerced Japan to sign a Plaza Accord. Chinese people do not believe in fallacies, nor are we afraid of evil forces. We will never yield to threats or coercion. As to words and deeds of forcefully making an issue of China, they remind people of an ancient poem: Along the Yangzi River, apes moan ceaselessly. My boat has passed ten thousand mounts briskly.</p> <p> It must be pointed out that making an issue of China can't save the US. Instead, it will continue to intensify all the problems Washington is facing, be they domestic or external, and squeeze the room to solve these issues in the future. Even some people of insight in the US have warned that the excessive attention on undermining Beijing's advantages could make Washington neglect its most important tasks at home and push its foreign policies to deviate from its course even further. "American hubris is always a danger, but so is exaggerated fear, which can lead to overreaction," wrote US scholar Joseph Nye last year. "The US and China must avoid exaggerated fears that could create a new cold or hot war," he added. It seems that those who are sick are unwilling to take medicine.</p> <p> The US is trying to oppose China in every possible aspect, reflecting the peremptory squeezing of reality by the US' anti-China ideology. But the reality is also resisting the ideological pressure at all times. The twist has distorted some US elites' mindset, making them fall into hesitation and division. However, the "China threat" is not the root cause of Washington's internal and external problems. Reality will make them understand sooner or later that win-win cooperation is the effective cure for their disease.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Global Times</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Geopolitical forecaster George Friedman recently attributed the worsening China-U.S. relationship to China's own actions and foresaw a consequential loss of China's global significance, saying China's enemy is the country itself.</p> <p> By scrutinizing the facts, one can quickly uncover the real enemy of China-U.S. ties: U.S. politicians and pundits engaged in toxic politics, who are adept at profiteering from provoking confrontation and distorting the truth, internationally and domestically.</p> <p> In an interview with VOA Chinese last week, Mr. Friedman mentioned that China should not have systematically alienated the United States since the latter was its top trade partner, suggesting the trade tension between them is "unnecessary." He is mostly right, except that the initiator of the current trade war is former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, not Beijing.</p> <p> U.S. businesses and customers have been bearing the brunt of the tariffs for years. The American Action Forum, a Washington D.C.-based policy institute, found Trump's tariffs on global goods annually increased U.S. consumer costs by roughly 51 billion U.S. dollars based on 2021 import levels.</p> <p> Despite repeated appeals by the business community, the current U.S. administration has continued its predecessor's hard-line approach toward China.</p> <p> As the U.S. annual inflation rate in March accelerated to 8.5 percent, a 40-year record, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday finally admitted that lowering tariffs on Chinese goods is "worth considering," given the "desirable effects" on cooling down inflation.</p> <p> Now that Washington is paying for the trade war it launched at the cost of American livelihoods, it is no longer in the position to practice its signature tough guy approach when trading with China.</p> <p> Mr. Friedman also claimed China has a clearer understanding of the global might of the dollar from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Potential tough sanctions would deter it from militarily resolving the Taiwan question since any mismanagement could pose a high risk to its stability.</p> <p> But the Taiwan question essentially differs from the Ukraine issue. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the question is purely China's internal affair. Don't underestimate the Chinese people's resolve and determination to uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p> <p> Out of pure malice rather than ignorance, some U.S. politicians and experts are knowingly linking up the two unrelated issues to cast China in an unfavorable light. Their real agenda is to sow a crisis across the Taiwan Strait to serve their perceived U.S. geopolitical and economic interests at the price of regional peace and stability.</p> <p> Meanwhile, Mr. Friedman's boasting of the weaponization of the dollar demonstrated how he and many others in Washington have taken U.S. hegemony and interventionism for granted. But in an era of globalization, a dollar war is doomed to backfire.</p> <p> As the whole world has witnessed, Western sanctions on Moscow due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict has already created great trouble for the global economy. More serious global consequences could follow should an economic war occur with China.</p> <p> Toxic U.S. politicians, who have been spreading conspiracy theories and encouraging conflicts for political and economic gain, are accountable for the tense U.S.-China relations and painful repercussions. Blaming the victim is just a gimmick frequently deployed to mislead the public.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> Chinese President Xi Jinping called on countries to continue developing and strengthening Asia, demonstrate Asia’s resilience, wisdom and strength, and make Asia an anchor for world peace, a powerhouse for global growth and a new pacesetter for international cooperation in his recent keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2022.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0427/FOREIGN202204270919000350970247272.png" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>The CDA5B1 meter-gauge AC transmission diesel locomotives produced by CRRC Qishuyan Co., Ltd. for Thailand are loaded onto a ship at a wharf of Changzhou west port in Changzhou city, east China’s Jiangsu province, Dec. 20, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/Shi Kang)</em></p> <p> Having been through hot and cold wars, hardships and tribulations, people in Asia deeply cherish the value of peace and understand that development gains do not come easily. Xi’s propositions put forward at the recently-concluded annual conference of the BFA&nbsp;charted directions for maintaining peace, promoting cooperation, and enhancing solidarity among Asian countries and pointed the way for their seizing historic opportunity to build a community with a shared future for Asia.</p> <p> Over the past decades, Asia has enjoyed overall stability and rapid and continued economic growth, making possible the Asian Miracle.</p> <p> “Peace and stability in our region does not fall into our lap automatically or come as charity from any country. Rather, it is the result of the joint efforts of countries in the region,” Xi pointed out in his speech.</p> <p> Rising from the misery inflicted by colonialism, militarism, and hegemonism, Asia knows the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century.</p> <p> The current European security crisis has made more and more Asian countries realize that they can only keep their future in their own hands when they&nbsp;honor such principles as mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, and follow a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0427/FOREIGN202204270920000019914984621.png" style="width: 863px; height: 575px;" /></p> <p> <em>The first special train running between Yichun city, east China’s Jiangxi province, and the ASEAN countries via Ningbo city, east China’s Zhejiang province, is being loaded at the section No. 370 of the Jiangxi provincial bureau of the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration at Yichunxi Railway Station, Jan. 27, 2022.

Countries on the continent are bound to make new strides in mutually beneficial cooperation.</p> <p> The prosperity and stability in Asia is hard-won and couldn’t be cherished too much. Choosing dialogue and cooperation over zero-sum games, openness and inclusiveness over a closed-door and exclusive approach, and exchanges and mutual learning over a sense of superiority: this is the only choice worthy of the broad-mindedness of Asians.</p> <p> It is the heartfelt wish shared by people in Asia that countries follow the path of peace and development, seek win-win cooperation, and contribute to an Asian family of unity and progress together.</p> <p> Asian countries are wise and capable enough to cement ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture, and uphold a regional order that balances the aspirations and accommodates the interests of all parties.</p> <p> As Asia enjoys sound development momentum, countries both in and outside the region should all add splendor rather than trouble to the region, which should be the basic norm for their participation in Asian affairs.</p> <p> Any attempt to stick to the Cold War mentality and deliberately provoke confrontation to undermine the development of Asia will find little support.</p> <p> As a member of the Asian family, China will always be an active participant in and important contributor to the peaceful development and win-win cooperation in Asia, no matter how the world changes.</p> <p> China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, as well as openness and cooperation, actively advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and promote the implementation of the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative it proposed, thus continuously injecting positive energy into the peace, development and win-win cooperation in Asia and the world.</p> <p> As Xi said, to break through the mist and embrace a bright future, the biggest strength comes from cooperation and the most effective way is through solidarity.</p> <p> The open, inclusive, and confident China will stand with various countries in solidarity under the banner of true multilateralism. They will stay committed to the regionalism featuring lasting peace, common development, and openness, and jointly build a community with a shared future for Asia and a community with a shared future for mankind.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- In a world that is mired deep in a string of conflicts epitomized by the still raging COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine crisis and a faint economic recovery, the sound and steady development of China-France relations is all the more important.</p> <p> Emmanuel Macron won the 2022 French presidential runoff Sunday to become the first French president in 20 years to win re-election, which, it is believed, is conducive to maintaining continuity in French foreign policy and thus to the further development of both France-China and European Union (EU)-China relations.</p> <p> China-France friendship enjoys a profound foundation. France is the first major Western country to establish formal diplomatic ties with China, and the first to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership and conduct strategic dialogue with China. Both countries pursue independent foreign policies and share the same or similar views on a range of global issues.</p> <p> During Macron's first term, France-China relations have maintained a sound and steady development. In January 2018, Macron made his first visit to China, becoming the first foreign head of state to visit China that year. In 2019, Macron attended the second China International Import Expo.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese and French people have been fighting the pandemic shoulder to shoulder. The two countries support each other on issues such as climate change and biodiversity.</p> <p> Bilateral practical cooperation has been yielding concrete results. Last year, bilateral trade exceeded 80 billion U.S. dollars, hitting a new high. China's total imports of agricultural products from France increased by 40 percent year-on-year.</p> <p> Against the backdrop of profound changes unseen in a century and the international situation fraught with tension and turbulence, China and France should keep up with the positive, healthy and upward trajectory, adhere to the principle of mutual respect and equality, strengthen dialogue and exchanges at all levels, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and push for new achievements in bilateral cooperation.</p> <p> France, under Macron's second term, is also expected to continue to play a constructive role in advancing EU-China relations. China has maintained that China and the EU should uphold a correct understanding of each other, and stick to mutual respect, dialogue and cooperation, and mutual benefit. France and China should work together to build the greatest common ground and steer China-EU relations towards new development.</p> <p> Independence, mutual understanding, foresight, mutual benefit and win-win outcomes are the original aspiration of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France.</p> <p> As Macron is embarking on his second term, there are high expectations for France-China relations to bring more certainty and stability to the world at this moment of volatility.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

However, the military bloc, instead of disintegrating like the Warsaw Pact, became a tool of American power, seeking polarization and hegemony throughout the world.</p> <p> From supporting continuous eastward expansion, to instigating the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Washington has led NATO to engage in various actions, which not only added constant pressure on Russia, but also deepened the divide between Russia and Europe, leading to an increase in Europe’s reliance on the U.S..</p> <p> While all of these actions were not obviously associated with each other, Washington had an aim in planning these events. Washington’s goal was to maintain U.S. hegemony throughout the world by creating “controllable chaos”. The U.S. has decades of experience in this respect, and similar practices applied by Washington in declaring wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, are easily noticeable.</p> <p> NATO repeatedly served as a pawn for the U.S. in supporting America’s war in Afghanistan and airstrikes in Syria. These military operations, carried out by the U.S. under the guise of “peace,” “democracy” and “human rights,” caused massive civilian causalities and extensive property damage.</p> <p> The Ukraine crisis once again proves that the U.S. hegemony is the fuse for global instability and the U.S. is the largest perpetrator of turmoil in the world.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> As the world undergoes profound changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, new traditional security risks and governance issues are arising, further fueling the tensions in international situation and increasing the difficulty of maintaining international order.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0426/FOREIGN202204260933000248912110517.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 514px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 17 shows street lamp banners of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 posted near the Boao airport in Qionghai, south China's Hainan province. (People's Daily Online/Meng Zhongde)</em></p> <p> Against this backdrop, Chinese President Xi Jinping, aiming to safeguard common interests of the world and create a future shared by mankind, encouraged the world to work together to tackle global governance challenges and embrace a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, when addressing the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2022 on April 21.</p> <p> He also stressed promoting the common values of humanity and upholding true multilateralism, saying it is particularly important for major countries to lead by example.</p> <p> His proposals fully demonstrated China's sense of responsibility to lead the reform of global governance system and promote historical progress in the quest of peace and justice.</p> <p> The world must uphold solidarity as it rises up to global governance challenges.</p> <p> "In this day and age, the international community has evolved so much that it has become a sophisticated and integrated apparatus. Acts to remove any single part will cause serious problems to its operation. When that happens, both the victims and the initiators of such acts will stand to lose."</p> <p> President Xi's simile vividly explained that countries around the world share a same future. Facing outstanding global challenges, the right choice remains to enhance international cooperation and give full play to the global governance system, rather than doing the opposite and arbitrarily hindering international cooperation under all kinds of excuses.</p> <p> Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, some countries have been trying to tie the whole world to it, turning world economy into a political issue, a tool and even a weapon, with a total disregard for whether it would impact the life of the people around the world.</p> <p> Such practice will not help solve the crisis at all, and may destroy the international economic cooperation outcomes achieved in the past decades.</p> <p> As it confronts global governance challenges, the world must uphold real multilateralism.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0426/FOREIGN202204260933000562681600379.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 449px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 17 shows the International Conference Center of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)</em></p> <p> While the globe remains in the grip of the pandemic, it is facing new traditional security risks. Meanwhile, the widening development gap is further bothering the sluggish global recovery, and new issues such as digital governance are emerging while climate change and other governance issues still need to be addressed.</p> <p> It is never a good idea to go it alone to solve these problems. Global actions, response and cooperation are required to overcome these concerns. Only by practicing a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, can countries expand common ground and build the most powerful strength.</p> <p> Hegemonism and power politics are presently posing a grave danger to the world's peace and progress. It is urgent to uphold true multilateralism and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which is also a common aspiration of the international society.</p> <p> Major country must fulfill their responsibilities as the world rises up to global governance challenges.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0426/FOREIGN202204260935000006442891302.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" /></p> <p> <em>A sub-forum of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 is held, April 20, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)</em></p> <p> A country’s international status is measured by its openness of mind, breadth of vision, and sense of responsibility rather than its size, strength or power. "It is particularly important for major countries to lead by example in honoring equality, cooperation, good faith and the rule of law, and act in a way befitting their status," President Xi said.</p> <p> To maintain their hegemonic status, a few major countries have stuck to Cold War mentality and provoked confrontations, which further exacerbated tensions and separation, making more troubles for the troubled world.</p> <p> In today’s world, unilateralism and excessive pursuit of self-interest are doomed to fail; so are the practices of decoupling, supply disruption and maximum pressure; so are the attempts to forge “small circles” or to stoke conflict and confrontation along ideological lines. Major countries should follow the trend of the times and play a constructive role in global governance.</p> <p> China is enhancing and improving global governance with concrete actions. Facing the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, it is actively promoting all relevant parties to improve global public health governance, so as to build concerted strength against the virus. When addressing the outstanding security risks, it has proposed a Global Security Initiative to contribute to the reform of the global security governance system. To jump-start the sluggish world economy, the country is also committed to improving global economic governance and building an open world economy. It has raised and is implementing the Global Development Initiative to help countries tide over difficulties.</p> <p> Countries around the world are like passengers aboard the same ship who share the same destiny. For the ship to navigate the storm and sail toward a bright future, all passengers must pull together. The thought of throwing anyone overboard is simply not acceptable.</p> <p> Difficulties and challenges are not to be afraid of. What's important is to up hold solidarity and be courageous. China will collaborate with the international community to follow the trend of the times featuring peace, development and win-win cooperation, cope with global challenges with cooperation and enhance global governance with concrete actions, so as to move in the direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0426/FOREIGN202204260835000540095107290.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 593px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 24, 2022 shows the scene of French incumbent President Emmanuel Macron's rally after the presidential runoff in Paris, France. (Xinhua/Gao Jing)</em></p> <p> The much-anticipated voting in the French presidential runoff election ended on Sunday. The incumbent president Emmanuel Macron once again defeated his "old rival" Marine Le Pen to win the election, making Macron the first French president to be re-elected in nearly 20 years. The two candidates held entirely different views on issues such as the European Union, relations with Russia, the economy, immigration, and pensions. Therefore, the election was also seen as a "historic" choice for voters to choose between the "two Frances that confront each other."</p> <p> On the surface, this French presidential election is a contest between the centrist and far-right parties, but essentially, it is a competition between European integration and anti-European integration, as well a contest between globalization and anti-globalization. Some Western media said that, if Le Pen had won the second round, it would mean that France would have elected a female president for the first time and the far-right parties would have led the country in an unprecedentedly manner. It is widely believed that such a scenario could have led to a "political earthquake" comparable to Brexit and Donald Trump being elected as the US president. Therefore, after Macron's victory, some French media breathed a sigh of relief saying that the "earthquake" did not happen.</p> <p> "Strategic autonomy" was the eye-catching label of Macron's first term. As the youngest president in French history, Macron has demonstrated a steady and pragmatic style in domestic affairs over the past five years and inherited France's tradition of independence and autonomy in foreign affairs. He has carefully kept a distance from Washington, believing France and EU should not be forced to take sides between China and the US. Instead, it should become an important pole in a multipolar world. Macron once bluntly criticized NATO, saying it is becoming "brain-dead" and raised the ambitious Initiative for Europe. He also stressed defense autonomy independent from the US, technology autonomy not reliant on other countries, and diplomatic autonomy without subordination to the US. It should be said that France plays an indispensable role in realizing Europe's strategic autonomy and rebalancing international relations.</p> <p> The reason why the French election this time has global implication is because of current uncertainties in Europe. Europe, once described by Charles de Gaulle as the "Archimedes' lever" of France, is a platform where France can play the role of a major power. But Washington is becoming the biggest influence behind it. Although the Biden administration has repeatedly claimed to "return to multilateralism" and expressed the willingness to repair transatlantic ties, it can hardly conceal its core interest of "America First." From the US withdrawing from Afghanistan to the signing of the AUKUS pact that ripped off France-Australia submarine deal, France and the EU have been made deeply aware of US' selfishness and arrogance. In the Russia-Ukraine crisis that is exhausting the two countries, Washington is attempting to drag Europe to make comprehensive profit.</p> <p> Against this background, it is very important for France to stabilize its role. The reelection of Macron can at least ensure the continuity and stability of major French policies to a great extent. In fact, the expectations for France, as the leader of the EU and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, from Europe and the whole international society go beyond this. Since the end of WWII, France has played a key leading role at several critical moments in Europe. For Macron, who is holding the banner of "returning to de Gaulleism" and seeking the EU's strategic autonomy, there are challenges, tests, but also ample room in today's France, Europe and the world.</p> <p> Diversity and multilateralism are in the genes of French culture. Be it during the Cold War or in the post-Cold War era, independent diplomatic routes had brought about huge strategic dividends to Paris. France partially withdrew from NATO in the 1960s and it was the first among Western major countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. After the end of the Cold War, France was the first Western major country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. It also prompted the EU to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. Against the background when uncertainties are significantly increasing in the world, China and France share many similar views in terms of safeguarding multilateralism and improving global governance. Strengthening cooperation between the two sides is of vital importance to promote world stability and prosperity.</p> <p> Improving China-France relations is consistent with strengthening Europe's strategic autonomy. We congratulate Macron on his reelection and expect China-France relations can continue to move forward and China-EU relations can go forward steadily during his second term.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Global Times</p> ]]></full-text>

It represents vivid practice of the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind in the security field, and contributes China’s solutions to problems haunting global security governance.</p> <p> “It has been proven time and again that the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century,” Xi said in his keynote speech.</p> <p> Building a world that enjoys universal security is a shared aspiration of people in all countries. Humanity is living in an indivisible security community, and countries must explore a path that ensures security for all, by all and of all.</p> <p> In order to maintain peace and stability in the world, countries must adhere to the correct security vision. The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi stressed that it is important that all countries stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250910000219508789290.jpg" style="width: 864px; height: 576px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo shows a view of the sub-forum on energy development of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, which kicked off in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province, on April 20, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Yuan Chen)</em></p> <p> The security vision, which has rich connotations, lays emphasis on respecting and ensuring the security of each and every country, upholding security in both traditional and non-traditional fields, promoting the security of both individual countries and broader regions through dialogue and cooperation, and focusing on development and security so that security would be durable. It represents the core concept and laid a basic foundation for building a world that enjoys universal security.</p> <p> Countries must abandon the outdated Cold War mentality if they want to maintain world peace and stability. Quite a number of the security issues today have been caused by certain countries’ pursuit of hegemonism and power politics.</p> <p> The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi calls on countries to stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reject the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and say no to group politics and bloc confrontation; and stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, uphold the principle of indivisible security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the pursuit of one’s own security at the cost of others’ security.</p> <p> Conforming to the historical trend toward economic globalization, multi-polarity in the world and democracy in international relations, the Global Security Initiative emphasizes that security is universal, equal, inclusive, and should be based on mutual respect between countries and the premise that all countries jointly uphold the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which sets forth specific principles at bilateral and multilateral levels for building a world that enjoys universal security.</p> <p> Responsible actions must be taken so as to maintain peace and stability in the world. In today’s world, security means much more than before and its implications go well beyond a single region or time frame. All sorts of factors could have a bearing on a country’s security.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250910000561674456196.jpg" style="width: 865px; height: 486px;" /></p> <p> <em>Aerial photo taken on April 12, 2022 shows the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) International Conference Center in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province.&nbsp;(People’s Daily Online/Yuan Chen)</em></p> <p> The ways countries resolve differences and disputes and respond to various security threats determine the direction in which the international security situation develops.</p> <p> The Global Security Initiative encourages countries to stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between them through dialogue and consultation, support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, reject double standards, and oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction; and stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and work together on regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity.</p> <p> By stressing the importance of promoting security through dialogue and cooperation, taking a multi-pronged and holistic approach, and basing actions on the present situation while adopting a long-term perspective, the initiative offers feasible ideas for achieving long-term peace, stability and security in the world.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

Uneven recovery is aggravating inequality across the world, further widening the North-South divide,” Xi noted.</p> <p> The impacts of the Ukraine crisis have continued to spill over into more regions, putting more strain on the world economy, which has already faced with fragile and weak recovery.</p> <p> Changes of the world, of the times and of history are posing severe challenges to the global development cause, which must be taken seriously by humanity.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250906000105053426654.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 3, 2022 shows the busy Nansha Port, Longxue Island, Nansha district, Guangzhou city, south China’s Guangdong province. (People’s Daily Online/Wei Jinsong)</em></p> <p> The pandemic has resulted in the relapse of several emerging nations into poverty and instability. Numerous people in developed countries are also living through a hard time due to the pandemic.</p> <p> “Safety and health are the prerequisite for human development and progress,” Xi said, emphasizing the need of countries supporting each other, better coordinating response measures and improving global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic.</p> <p> More than 10 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally, but about 83 percent of Africa’s population has yet to receive a single dose. The top priority for countries at the moment is to close the immunization gap.</p> <p> China has honored its commitment to making Chinese COVID vaccines a global public good and tried to ensure their accessibility and affordability in developing countries, according to Xi. The country has provided over 2.1 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations, and will follow through the pledged donation of 600 million and 150 million doses of vaccines to Africa and ASEAN countries respectively.</p> <p> The global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted; commodity prices continue to climb; and energy supply remains tight. These risks amplify one another and exacerbate the uncertainties surrounding economic recovery.</p> <p> The global low inflation environment has notably changed, and the risks of inflation driven by multiple factors are surfacing. If major economies slammed on the brakes or took a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability.</p> <p> Xi urged countries to increase macro policy coordination, turn to science and technology for more growth drivers, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and prevent serious negative spillovers from policy adjustments in some countries to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development.</p> <p> In the planet that we call home, humankind shares the same future. Only by staying on top of the dominant trend of economic globalization and adhering to the times' tendency of peace, development and win-win cooperation can human beings jointly surmount difficulties and embrace a brighter future.</p> <p> True development is development for all and good development is sustainable. The entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the completion and operation of the China-Laos Railway have effectively improved regional “hard connectivity” of infrastructure and “soft connectivity” of rules and standards, demonstrating how win-win cooperation between countries drives development.、</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0425/FOREIGN202204250906000242369811511.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 534px;" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on April 17, 2022 shows national flags of various counties fluttering in the wind at the Qionghai Boao Airport in Boao township, south China’s Hainan province, host township of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People’s Daily Online/Meng Zhongde)</em></p> <p> China has actively pressed ahead with high-quality Belt and Road cooperation for high-standard, sustainable and people-centered growth, injecting strong impetus into the sustainable development of countries along the routes of the initiative. The GDI proposed by China has been echoed and supported by the United Nations and other international organizations and nearly 100 countries. These are convincing evidence of China’s efforts to promote the global development cause in pursuit of win-win results.</p> <p> As the Ukraine crisis continues to escalate, geopolitical factors are encumbering global economic recovery and further disrupting the global development cause; developing countries are bearing the brunt of the effects.</p> <p> China has persisted in promoting peace talks and stressed that all parties should create the necessary environment and conditions for advancing peace talks. This is a decision made by the country not only for world peace and security, but for global development.</p> <p> “A review of human history teaches us that the more difficult things get, the greater the need grows to stay confident,” Xi pointed out. China will continue to join hands with various countries and create tremendous synergy through win-win cooperation to together overcome various roadblocks along the way, promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development, and push forward the global development cause.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The era of the Cold War is already more than 30 years in the past. And yet, NATO has never stopped pursuing its eastward expansion, which eventually led to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The U.S., the backstage manipulator of NATO’s eastward expansion, and which has already raked in huge profits from the conflict, has not only benefited from the conflict, but also has attempted to seek hegemony amid tensions.</p> <p> Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the stock prices of relevant companies have all dropped, but those of American military companies have meanwhile soared. The stock prices of U.S. military firms Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies Corporation increased by about 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in the most recent nearly one-month period. Gregory J. Hayes, CEO of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, said his company will benefit from the tensions now unfolding around the world.</p> <p> This is not the first time that the Americans have profited from a war, and the repeated conduct of the U.S. in its raking in profits from wars around the world are just too numerous to count. According to a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on March 14, the overall volume of international transfers of major arms between 2017 and 2021 was lower than that between 2012 and 2016. However, during the same period, the arms exports of the U.S. increased significantly. The U.S. is the world’s largest arms exporter, while crises and wars undoubtedly provide hotbeds for U.S. military companies and American politicians to make a fortune.</p> <p> In addition to supporting American arms producers, there are other measures that Washington has taken to allow the U.S. to profit from wars. Plundering and controlling the energy markets has always been an important aim of the U.S. government in instigating confrontations and waging wars around the world. The U.S. authorities, while saying that they stand on the side of peace and justice, are actually thinking about how to get more Americans engaged in what is a lucrative business.</p> <p> The rights and wrongs in the Russia-Ukraine crisis can and will be witnessed by all. The U.S. has exposed its selfishness and hypocrisy by pouring fuel on the fire. Washington is the one that is profiting from the conflict, and the Americans may be the only ones who benefit from the conflict.</p> <p> While taking advantage of the conflict to rake in huge profits, the U.S. has also reinforced the bloc that it established by ganging up with its Western allies, and has attempted to contain its “imaginary enemies,” thus further exacerbating divisions and confrontations between countries and then taking advantage of these divisions and confrontations to consolidate its global hegemony.</p> <p> In the meantime, with the U.S. government failing to curb such persistent domestic problems as the country’s political divides, ethnic conflicts, and rising violent crimes, not to mention the rapidly spreading COVID-19 virus and rampant high inflation, a conflict in Europe offers a perfect opportunity that U.S. politicians can make use of in order to serve U.S. domestic political purposes and distract the attention of the American public from domestic contradictions.</p> <p> However, the whole world is paying a price as the U.S. seeks selfish gains. Led by the U.S., Western countries have imposed all-round and undifferentiated sanctions against Russia, which not only has complicated the situation in the region, but has also struck a heavy blow to the world economy. Affected by a rise in the prices of bulk commodities, many countries and regions, including the Eurozone, are seeing soaring inflation, which is severely straining the livelihoods of the common people residing in these various European countries and regions.</p> <p> Europe is entering a difficult phase in its history. The region will face, in the short term, higher inflation and slower growth. There is considerable uncertainty about how large these effects will be and how long they will last for, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), pointed out.</p> <p> For a long time, the U.S. has instigated confrontations and conflicts in countries around the world in an attempt to make a fortune, severely undermining international peace and stability. The tricks of American leaders will sooner or later be seen through for what they are. The U.S., by hyping up threats of wars, aggravating regional conflicts, profiting from tensions in relevant countries, and raking in huge profits from crises at the expense of its allies and even the whole world, is bound to be resisted and opposed by the international community of nations.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily Online</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Zhang Nan)</em></p> <p> BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- As the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 wrapped up in south China's Hainan Island on Friday, participants are walking away knowing that China remains a stabilizing force for the world at this precarious moment.</p> <p> The forum was held against the backdrop of recurring COVID-19 outbreaks, rising geopolitical tensions and higher inflation, all of which have spelled more uncertainties for the global economy.</p> <p> All eyes were on China, whose economic performance and trade policies have far-reaching influences.</p> <p> Registering a 4.8-percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of this year, China's economy is off to a steady start, a feat accomplished despite the daunting challenges of contracting demand, supply chain shocks and a weak forecast.</p> <p> The healthy economic output, grown out of a series of pro-growth policies rolled out by Beijing, underscores the resilience of China's economy.</p> <p> Faced with the challenges of the pandemic, China has executed a dynamic zero-COVID approach, balancing the tasks of protecting its population from the virus with keeping its economy on track.</p> <p> Meanwhile, China has done its best to support the worldwide cause of fighting the pandemic, and actively promoted foreign trade, which have helped stabilize the global supply chain and alleviated inflation, benefiting China's trade partners.</p> <p> Last year, China's foreign trade exceeded 6 trillion U.S. dollars for the first time, reaching a new height. In the first quarter of this year, China's total imports and exports of goods grew by 10.7 percent year-on-year. The figures highlight the global dividends of China as the "world factory" and "world market," which are especially valuable given the shadow of hyperinflation.</p> <p> Furthermore, China's actual use of foreign direct investment (FDI) hit a record high when it expanded 14.9 percent year-on-year to 1.15 trillion yuan (around 177 billion dollars) in 2021. In the first quarter of this year, China's actual use of FDI increased by 25.6 percent year-on-year.</p> <p> Facing unfavorable external factors including the accelerated pace of the U.S. Federal Reserve's tapering and interest rate hikes and the tightening of global liquidity, China has focused on its own economic realities, relied on its large market advantage and strong foreign exchange reserves, pursued a proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy, maintained a reasonable amount of liquidity, and demonstrated its regulatory strength and policy determination.</p> <p> On April 15, China's central bank said it had decided to lower the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions by 0.25 percentage point from April 25, enhancing its support for the development of the real economy and for the reduction in comprehensive financing costs.</p> <p> To offset risks brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China has insisted on peace, and exerted stability on the global supply chain through public goods such as the Belt and Road Initiative.</p> <p> All these facts have made it abundantly clear that China is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order, and that it has injected and will continue to inject urgently needed certainty into an unpredictable world.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Xinhua/Wang Ying)</em></p> <p> The COVID-19 pandemic continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern, said the World Health Organization (WHO) in a recent statement, calling on countries to maintain response measures.</p> <p> However, some countries have decided to "lie flat" with the "let it rip" approach. For instance, many states of the U.S. have ended mask mandates, relaxed indoor control measures and shut down COVID testing sites. The UK has removed all COVID-19 restrictions and stopped offering free COVID-19 testing for the general public.</p> <p> Germany cancelled most of its control measures and some other countries, including Switzerland, removed them all. Besides, compliance with control measures in Sweden has always been voluntary rather than mandatory since the outbreak of COVID-19, and the country has never implemented lockdown or shut down enterprises to prevent the spread of the virus.</p> <p> Is the "let it rip" approach making situations better in these countries?</p> <p> Not really.</p> <p> A report written by American public health experts found that the U.S. saw the largest decline in life expectancy over the past two years among the 20 wealthy countries the report studied. And the country was the only one that experienced a drop in life expectancy in both 2020 and 2021, while the rest saw a rebound last year after undergoing a slight decline in 2020.</p> <p> According to statistics released by the Office for National Statistics of the UK earlier this month, one in 13 people in the country was estimated to have been infected with the virus, nearly 20 times the average prevalence recorded previously.</p> <p> As a matter of fact, the "let it rip" approach not only imposes health and safety risks against the people in the countries that adopt it, but also impedes global efforts to fight the virus.</p> <p> WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently warned that some countries have relaxed public health and social measures and reduced testing, impacting thus the global ability to monitor evolution of the virus.</p> <p> What's even worse, the instability brought by Western countries' "let it rip" approach is making COVID-19 control much more difficult for developing countries.</p> <p> Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization noted that vaccination gaps will keep Latin America at risk during future waves. A study suggests that more than two-thirds of all Africans have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, adding that the virus is still spreading and may evolve into more dangerous variants.</p> <p> Studies show that the mortality during Omicron waves was higher than that when Delta prevailed, though the death rate in the recent days declined. The Omicron variant is still dangerous. It is especially threatening aging groups and patients with serious underlying diseases. Therefore, timely nucleic acid testing, effective control measures and fair vaccination are still what's needed today.</p> <p> The WHO Emergency Committee for COVID-19 suggested that countries continue to use evidence-informed and risk-based public health and social measures, and be prepared to scale up these measures rapidly in response to changes in the virus and the population immunity.</p> <p> Recently, the surging infections have already prompted some countries to restart control measures that had been relaxed or canceled. The White House declared to extend the U.S. coronavirus public health emergency on April 13, and Germany reversed course on plans to end mandatory quarantine. Facing the Omicron sublineage BA.2, which is more transmissible and undetectable, countries "lying flat" are just seesawing their response measures.</p> <p> In front of a pandemic that is unseen in a century and concerns the future of mankind, countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which their shared destiny hinges. Only with science-based and firm control measures can they jointly walk out of the shadows and embrace a bright future.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- As some Western media jump to talk about the "big blow" China's dynamic zero-COVID policy has dealt to the economy, they neglect one of its biggest characteristics -- its resilience.</p> <p> Naturally, all anti-epidemic measures come at a price, and there has been short-term downward pressure on the Chinese economy. But it would be shortsighted to believe that this will cripple the growth of the world's second largest economy.</p> <p> First of all, China has been careful to monitor the duration and scope of all anti-epidemic measures, and the vast majority of its people are still enjoying a normal life, free from the woes of the epidemic.</p> <p> Moreover, we can be certain that the financial hub of Shanghai will rebound from anti-epidemic measures, and this is also true for the rest of the nation.</p> <p> China has over two years of experience as well as a track record that speaks for itself in coordinating epidemic prevention and economic development.</p> <p> Second, with better-than-expected growth in the first quarter, China's economy is off to a steady start this year. It exceeded market expectations with year-over-year growth of 4.8 percent, well above 4 percent in the previous quarter.</p> <p> In the same period, China's total imports and exports of goods jumped by 10.7 percent year on year, while paid-in foreign direct investment (FDI) soared by 25.6 percent year on year.</p> <p> This rock-steady start only goes to show that the momentum of China's sustained economic recovery remains unhinged. China continues to draw from its array of strong economic fundamentals such as its industrial supply chains and its colossal consumer market.</p> <p> Thirdly, China has already rolled out a raft of supportive policies to counter the fallout of the COVID-19 resurgence.</p> <p> The People's Bank of China, the central bank, announced a 0.25 percentage point cut of the reserve requirement ratio from April 25, injecting 530 billion yuan (about 82 billion U.S. dollars) of liquidity into the market.</p> <p> The central bank, together with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, this week jointly released 23 measures to help businesses affected by the latest COVID-19 resurgence to improve domestic economic circulation and facilitate exports.</p> <p> In 2022, the 400 billion yuan inclusive re-lending fund that especially targets micro and small enterprises will continue to be used on a rolling basis, and the quota can be expanded if necessary.</p> <p> Other supportive policies included setting a quota of 3.65 trillion yuan for local-government-issued special-purpose bonds to fund construction projects, 2.5 trillion yuan worth of tax and fee cuts in 2022, and front-loading the construction of major projects.</p> <p> And last but not least, China is known for having an extensive policy toolkit it can use to stimulate the economy, such as the deep cash reserve held by commercial banks.</p> <p> There is still plenty of room to adjust monetary and fiscal policies, including the injection of more liquidity and more tax and fee cuts.</p> <p> Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun said, in an article published on April 16, that the proactive fiscal policy will be front-loaded and fully implemented.</p> <p> Policies need to be issued at the earliest possible date with funds allocated in a timely way to generate economic activities and stabilize the economy, Liu said in the article in the Qiushi Journal, a flagship magazine of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.</p> <p> All in all, any impartial eye can see that China is poised to overcome the challenges that lie ahead, achieve sustained economic growth, and make further contributions to world economic recovery. ■</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Even without firing a single shot or deploying any soldiers in Ukraine, the United States is still considered a combatant in the Russia-Ukraine military conflict. By weaponizing its global financial supremacy, Washington's financial terrorism is escalating the already highly-charged confrontation and sending shockwaves around the world.</p> <p> The moment Moscow launched the military operation, Washington rushed to maneuver a ton of sanctions against Moscow, removing Russian banks from the international financial messaging system SWIFT, freezing any Russian assets "touching the U.S. financial system," and threatening to "crush Russia's economy."</p> <p> Russia and the rest of the world have already felt the repercussions. Following the sanctions, ratings agencies downgraded Russia to "junk" status. The Institute of International Finance predicted a double-digit contraction in Russia's economic growth.</p> <p> On the global scale, the sanctions fueled sharp hikes of oil and natural gas prices. Sizable increase in the prices of key commodities is triggering accelerated high inflation in many countries and weakening the already faltering global recovery from the pandemic.</p> <p> It is abundantly clear that the United States, by exploiting the U.S. dollar's global dominance, is converting the international financial system into an international sanctions system.</p> <p> In the mid 1960s, when fixed exchange rates based on the post-World War II gold standard were gradually replaced by a global system reliant on the dollar as the primary means of cross-border payments and reserves, France's then Finance Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing coined the phrase "exorbitant privilege" to bemoan a United States taking advantage of the dollar dominance for self-interest.</p> <p> Over the past more than 50 years, the United States has transformed that "exorbitant privilege" into an "exorbitant weapon of mass financial destruction" for geopolitical contention, and pulled the trigger multiple times.</p> <p> In early of the century, Washington executed the same playbook in its dealing with the Iran nuclear issue, expelling Iranian banks from SWIFT and banning imports of Iranian energy. Even now, the Iranian economy is still struggling in the shadow of Washington's sanctions.</p> <p> The latest sanctions and threats of more sanctions on Russia are another salient example that Washington is getting increasingly unscrupulous in abusing its dollar hegemony for self-serving purposes. The global community should stay ever more vigilant against Washington's unbounded financial terrorism.</p> <p> America's messing around is reminding all countries of the dangerous possibility of being cut off from the global financial market at Washington's whim.</p> <p> "The more we use it, the more other countries are going to diversify due to geopolitical reasons," said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a fellow for international political economy at the Council on Foreign Relations based in the United States.</p> <p> As a hedge against the risk of falling into the prey of Washington's financial terrorism, de-dollarization is being accepted as a rational option by more.</p> <p> Since the 2000s exactly when Washington started using the dollar dominance as a menacing tool for geopolitical coercion, the dollar's position as the world's dominant reserve currency has been going downhill.</p> <p> According to data from the International Monetary Fund, in 2021, the dollar accounted for less than 60 percent international foreign currency reserves, while in 2000, the number is more than 70 percent.</p> <p> By contrast, currencies of some emerging economies like the Chinese renminbi are gaining a larger share in international foreign currency reserves and transnational transactions.</p> <p> People with basic economic knowledge know that the value of a currency rests on people's trust in its issuer, typically a country's government. The eroding dollar dominance is a prognostic indicator of the shrinking trust the world holds towards Washington.</p> <p> The United States does not lack world-class minds to tell that Washington's addiction to dollar weaponization is provoking a backlash: the world's trust in the U.S. dollar and a global financial transaction system underpinned by the dollar is fading away. There is only one way to explain Washington politicians' craziness: they have grown too hubristic to make rational calls.</p> <p> Like in the game of Jenga, the tower of the dollar dominance is still standing, yet some of its blocks are being taken away. A complete collapse may take some time, yet seems inevitable in the future if Washington continues down the wrong and destructive path.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- As the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) kicked off its annual conference, Chinese President Xi Jinping called upon Asia to become an anchor for world peace, a powerhouse for global growth, and a new pacesetter for international cooperation.</p> <p> This year's event is being held as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage all over the world and the international situation turns increasingly grave, casting a shadow over global economic growth.</p> <p> Asia led the world in economic recovery in 2021 and remains a powerhouse of global economic growth. The Asian economy will still be in recovery in 2022, but its growth rate could be moderate, according to a BFA report titled "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress."</p> <p> Looking ahead to 2022, there are still many factors affecting Asia's economic growth, including the pandemic, the geopolitical situation, and the pace and intensity of monetary policy adjustments in some countries including the United States.</p> <p> Xi noted that the strength to break through the mist and embrace a bright future comes from cooperation, and that the most effective way to do so is through solidarity. Countries should uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and international order underpinned by international law. In particular, major countries should lead by example.</p> <p> Countries should remain committed to building an open world economy, stay on top of the dominant trend of economic globalization, and increase macro-policy coordination. They should turn to science and technology for more growth drivers, keep the global industrial and supply chains stable, and prevent serious negative spillovers from policy adjustments in certain countries, all in an effort to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development.</p> <p> Asia should seize the opportunities provided by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the China-Laos railway to foster a more open Asia-wide market and make new strides in mutually beneficial cooperation.</p> <p> Moreover, great efforts should be made to promote Asian unity. Choosing dialogue and cooperation over zero-sum games, openness and inclusiveness over a closed-door and exclusive approach, and exchanges and mutual learning over a sense of superiority -- these are the only choices worthy of the broad-mindedness of Asians.</p> <p> Despite increasing headwinds, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, including its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. China will provide great dynamism for the stability and recovery of the world economy and broader market opportunities for all countries.</p> <p> China will redouble its efforts to achieve high-quality development and expand its high-standard opening-up.

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> The Ukraine crisis has caught the attention of the entire world, making people wonder whether Europe can regain security and peace.</p> <p> Historically, Europe has considerably contemplated the issue of peace and made active practice in this respect.</p> <p> For instance, German philosopher Immanuel Kant published the famous essay Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch in 1795, putting forward the idea of achieving perpetual peace for humankind in practical and reasonable manner.</p> <p> Even during the Cold War, European countries were able to progress in building a common security architecture through dialogues and negotiations, and created and wrote the important principle of “indivisible security” into Helsinki Final Act, Charter of Paris for A New Europe and other agreements.</p> <p> However, the “Helsinki Spirit” never really put down roots in the European continent. The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has thrown the continent into warfare once again, which proves that the existing security architecture in Europe is seriously flawed.</p> <p> Although a bipolar system was long gone before the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine conflict, the “post-Cold War order” governing Europe’s security was never rid of the residual effects of the Cold War. Antagonistic contradiction was not removed and the Cold War mentality still prevailed.</p> <p> The U.S., the self-proclaimed winner in the Cold War that takes Russia as the loser, has roped in European countries to conduct political discrimination and economic “reform” against Russia and squeeze the latter’s security space.</p> <p> Theoretically, Europe’s security is governed by the “Helsinki Spirit” advocated by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), but what in practice holds a dominant position is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which beats the drum for a security concept full of exclusiveness and confrontation.</p> <p> NATO has been building up its strength by recruiting new members and expanding under its “new mission”, during which the military alliance and Russia have accumulated escalating conflicts of interest and gradually lost mutual trust. This has made Europe’s security situation seriously imbalanced.</p> <p> When the Ukraine crisis was emerging and escalating, the U.S. refused to assume its responsibility to carry out direct and equal dialogues with Russia on Europe’s security issue, though there was huge room to solve the problem with diplomatic means.</p> <p> Instead, the White House directed the NATO to show military deterrence, which squeezed the space for European countries to conduct diplomatic mediation. This led to an illusion that the U.S. and NATO could “provide protection” for Ukraine, and eventually prompted the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p> <p> The long-lasting peace in the region needs to be supported by a balanced security architecture, must be maintained by effective mutual trust measures, and requires employing all necessary means to ensure sustainable development.</p> <p> The security concerns of all relevant parties should be respected, and differences in the size, strength and systems of countries should not become a dividing line separating them from each other.</p> <p> Arduous journey as it may be to regain security and peace in Europe, countries in the region must take the unshirkable responsibility to build a long-term regional security architecture, as war-induced fear, refugee crisis, economic recession and poverty are even more unbearable.</p> <p> To restore security and peace in Europe, the European Union needs to give full play to its role as the most important political and economic organization in the region, uniting all forces in the region and even the international community that advocate peace talks and taking all possible measures that help enhance mutual trust rather than heightening hostility to promote Russia and Ukraine to conduct dialogues and negotiations for a ceasefire as early as possible.</p> <p> Europe has experienced alternate years of war and peace and should be well aware of the truth that “long-lasting peace can only be achieved by transforming enemies to friends.”</p> <p> The fact is that European countries and Russia have been and will always be neighbors. Therefore, European countries should handle major issues such as expanding sanctions against Russia and increasing military aid to Ukraine in a rational and prudent manner, conduct equal and candid dialogues with Russia on the establishment of a regional security architecture, and seek to reach a consensus with Russia on realizing the common interests of Europe and even Eurasia through economic cooperation, political reconciliation and other means.</p> <p> More importantly, Europe should make resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict and reshaping future regional security as the most important goal for achieving strategic autonomy, realize its role as the subject in restructuring European security, and urge the U.S. to take responsibility for not escalating the conflict, not evading contradictions with Russia, and not undermining European security.</p> <p> Only through gradual changes to ideas and long-term capacity building on the basis of conflict resolution can Europe establish an independent strategic position and provide a solid and strong guarantee for a sustainable regional security architecture.</p> <p> Regional security architecture cannot exclude any country in the region. As the international community generally reaches a consensus about pursuing development and economic globalization has made countries’ destinies more closely intertwined, Europe should, more than ever, endeavor to build a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture to promote long-term peace in Europe and Eurasia.</p> <p> <em>The author is&nbsp;the director of the Department for European Studies, China Institute of International Studies.</em></p> <p id='org_name'>Source: People's Daily</p> ]]></full-text>
