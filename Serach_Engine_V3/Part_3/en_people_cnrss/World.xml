	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- An armored gunman killed ten people and injured three at a supermarket in Buffalo of New York State on Saturday, according to local enforcement officials.</p> <p> The suspect is an 18-year-old white man heavily armed with tactical gear and a helmet, said Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia in a press briefing late Saturday.</p> <p> The gunman wore military-style clothing and body armor while carrying a rifle, according to reports.</p> <p> He had a camera and the shooting was live streamed, according to Gramaglia.</p> <p> The mass shooting is being investigated as a hate crime, said Stephen Belongia, the special agent in charge of the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p> <p> Gramaglia said 11 victims are black while the other two are white.</p> <p> The suspect drove to the supermarket around 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) and shot four people in the parking lot, said Gramaglia.</p> <p> "The shooter was not from this community. In fact, the shooter traveled hours from outside this community to perpetrate this crime on the people of Buffalo," said Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown.</p> <p> After shooting innocents inside the supermarket, the gunman once put the gun to his own neck but was persuaded by patrol officers to drop his gun, according to Gramaglia.</p> <p> The gunman has been taken into custody and transported to Buffalo Police Headquarters.</p> <p> The suspect will be arraigned on charge of murder in first degree Saturday evening, according to a district attorney.</p> <p> Named Tops Friendly Market, the supermarket is located in a black-dominated community, which is around two miles (3.2 km) northeast of downtown Buffalo.</p> <p> New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who was born in Buffalo, said she is on the way to Buffalo to assist with the response to the shooting and a family unification site has been set up for family members of the shooting victims.</p> <p> "We must do more to address the scourge of racism and anti-Semitism, and to pass commonsense gun safety measures to keep our communities safe," said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York State.</p> <p> More than 28,000 people have died or been injured due to gun-related incidents in the United States this year, according to a database run by the nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- As the additional tariffs imposed by the previous U.S. administration on Chinese products soured bilateral economic ties, continuously taking its toll on American businesses and consumers, it is high time the U.S. side discarded the false move.</p> <p> "Four years on, the trade war is still hurting U.S. consumers and companies, and forcing supply chain workarounds that make trade more complex and vulnerable," Christopher Tang, professor of supply chain management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, said in a recent article published on the South China Morning Post.</p> <p> Like the professor, many more U.S. trade groups and economists have been urging the Biden administration to scrap Trump-era additional tariffs on Chinese imports, regarding such tariffs as counterproductive to the U.S. economy.</p> <p> At a time when world economic recovery is still strangled by the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. economy itself faces soaring inflation, it will be both a right and responsible choice for the country to remove all additional tariffs as soon as possible, analysts said.</p> <p> <strong>WHO PAYS THE PRICE</strong></p> <p> Four years after the U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese goods, it has been a clear fact that the acts have brought more costs to U.S. companies, consumers and farmers.</p> <p> "American businesses and consumers, not Chinese exporters, are bearing the cost of Trump-era tariffs in the form of higher prices on made-in-China parts and products," David J. Bulman, assistant professor of China Studies and International Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said in an article published on The Hill earlier this year.</p> <p> Tariffs on Chinese goods have provoked retaliatory tariffs that have sharply reduced American exports to China, allowing other nations to move in on markets once dominated by the U.S., he noted.</p> <p> Since the additional tariffs were taken into effect, they have cost American companies 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars, and American household 1,300 U.S. dollars a year, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Qin Gang said during a recent interview with Forbes magazine, noting that the tariffs have not reduced the U.S. trade deficit.</p> <p> Americans for Free Trade, a broad coalition of trade organizations, recently warned that the Section 301 tariffs create an "additional economic burden" for American businesses, manufacturers, farmers, and families, make the United States less competitive globally and cause "disproportionate economic harm to an American economy grappling with ongoing inflation concerns."</p> <p> <strong>SOARING INFLATION PRESSURE</strong></p> <p> As the U.S. is experiencing the highest inflation in four decades, economists said eliminating additional tariffs on Chinese goods would help lower elevated inflation and stabilize inflation expectations.</p> <p> "The reasons to end the trade war with China keep piling up. Inflation is the latest case in point," David J. Bulman said.</p> <p> Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed Wednesday that U.S. consumer inflation in April surged by 8.3 percent from a year ago, marking the second straight month of inflation over 8 percent.</p> <p> Even Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Television that removing Trump-era China tariffs would have some "desirable" effects on inflation and "it's worth considering."</p> <p> "Americans are unhappy about rising inflation and costs, so providing tariff relief soon is one way to lower prices and increase demand, especially for consumer goods," said the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC), which represents 260 American companies that do business with China.</p> <p> <strong>BACK ON TRACK</strong></p> <p> As people from the American academic and industrial circles came to urge the government to drop additional tariffs on Chinese products, it is significant to recognize the essence of China-U.S. business ties and bring it back on track.</p> <p> The economic and trade relations between the world's two largest economies are mutually beneficial in nature and have been yielding win-win results.</p> <p> Taking employment for instance, U.S. exports of goods and services to China support hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country in almost every sector of the economy, according to the U.S. Export Report 2022 released by USCBC.</p> <p> "More than 300 congressional districts have over 1,000 jobs supported by exports to China, and eight are home to more than 10,000," the report said, noting that China remains an important market for U.S. exporters.</p> <p> In 2020 alone, the number of jobs supported by exports to China reached a total of 858,486, according to the USCBC's calculations.</p> <p> In addition to creating jobs, trade with China has helped increase the income of U.S. farmers as agricultural trade has been an important part of bilateral business activities.</p> <p> U.S. goods exports to China reached an all-time high in 2021, with oilseeds and grains seeing significant growth to cement their place as the top U.S. export to China, the USCBC report said.</p> <p> Last year, U.S. farmers sent 4.8 billion dollars more in oilseeds and crops such as soybeans, wheat, and corn, to China than they did the year before, bringing the latest total to 21.9 billion dollars.</p> <p> "As we face a complex and severe situation in agricultural development and food security worldwide, I firmly believe that China and the United States, as major agricultural producers, consumers and traders, should meet challenges together, maintain stable development of agriculture, enhance the resilience of agricultural supply chains, ensure food security domestically, and promote cooperation for international food security," Qin said.</p> <p> Despite the lingering COVID-19 disruptions, trade between China and the U.S. maintained sound momentum, rising 8.7 percent year on year to 1.56 trillion U.S. dollars in the first fourth months, demonstrating the high complementarity of the two economies.</p> <p> In the context of soaring prices, the removal of additional tariffs on Chinese goods meets the fundamental interests of American consumers and businesses, and is beneficial to the U.S., China and the whole world, China's commerce ministry spokesperson Shu Jueting said Thursday at a press briefing.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> PHNOM PENH, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Yan Sam En is a farmer in northeast Cambodia's Chetr Borei district. One day, almost 20 years ago, the father of five was working in the forest close to his home when he found four cluster bombs, unexploded remnants of the U.S. carpet bombing that devastated the area in the 1960s.</p> <p> <strong>A USELESS PERSON</strong></p> <p> "I didn't want my children to play with the bombs, so I collected them, and as I did, one exploded. It blew off both my arms, and left me totally blind," Sam En told Xinhua on Friday. "I was 43 years old. I'm almost 61 now, but time has not healed me."</p> <p> Sam En says he has been nothing but a burden to his family since the blast. He cannot do anything. He just sits at home all day. "The U.S. deprived me of everything. In a few seconds, I went from breadwinner to useless person."</p> <p> The cluster bombs that claimed Sam En's eyes and arms are just a reminder of countless bombs that the U.S. dropped on Cambodia during the U.S.-Vietnam War, claiming countless other arms, legs and eyes, and thousands of lives. Between 1965 and 1973, the U.S. dropped 230,516 bombs in Cambodia. In April alone, at least five U.S. Mk 82 bombs, weighing about 500 pounds each, were found across the country. On May 5, a Cambodian bomb disposal team safely removed a U.S. bomb, weighing 2,000 pounds, from the Chaktomuk river opposite the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh.</p> <p> "At that time, I saw U.S. warplanes flying around. They dropped bombs to cut off roads and bridges," Sam En said. "We lived in fear every day and ran to hide in trenches when we heard the warplanes."</p> <p> Sam En said the U.S. has not provided any support to victims like him of its leftover bombs.</p> <p> <strong>'VICIOUS, UNDECLARED WAR'</strong></p> <p> Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen wrote in his book "10 Years of Cambodia's Journey, 1979-1989" that the bombings killed "tens of thousands of civilians" in a "vicious, undeclared war"</p> <p> Ly Thuch, first vice president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA), said Cambodia is still suffering from the huge legacy of the U.S.-Vietnam war and Cambodia's own internal conflicts. "There are a lot of bombs scattered on the ground, under the ground and in the water. We have not even conducted a large-scale search for underwater bombs, yet," he told Xinhua.</p> <p> "Unexploded ordnance is a constant danger. Villages, farmland and rice fields still contain explosive remnants of war and the affected land cannot be farmed," he added.</p> <p> Joseph Matthews of BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh said because of U.S. bombs many people have lost their lives or been maimed. According to the CMAA, from 1979 to March 2022, unexploded ordnance and landmines had killed 19,816 people and injured 45,175 others in Cambodia.</p> <p> "I strongly believe that the U.S. is morally responsible for the suffering of these people and ethically and legally bound to adequately compensate the families of those who had lost their lives or were maimed by these unexploded ordnance and landmines," Matthews told Xinhua.</p> <p> <strong>WOUNDS TO BE HEALED</strong></p> <p> Chhum Thea is 62 now. He lost his left arm to a mine in Kampong Cham province in 1990.</p> <p> "U.S. planes bombed my village often during the war. The earth trembled as if it was an earthquake," he told Xinhua.</p> <p> The bombs caused huge destruction. The U.S. must help Cambodia and compensate the innocent victims. I want the U.S. to heal the wounds that it created."</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Kenya on Saturday began trial runs on the Chinese-built Nairobi expressway ahead of its commissioning in the next few weeks. (Photo by Fred Mutune/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya on Saturday began trial runs on the Chinese-built Nairobi expressway ahead of its commissioning in the next few weeks.</p> <p> James Macharia, the cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development, said Saturday during a media briefing in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, that there is massive interest among motorists to use the toll road that stretches from the western side of the city to the southeast edge of the metropolis.</p> <p> "It is one of the best pieces of infrastructure ever done in Africa. In fact, it's the longest expressway in Africa. And so, we are very proud today to come to witness the start of the trial run, which will be done for about three or four weeks," said Macharia, adding that 11,000 Kenyan road users have registered, and the number will go up to almost 50,000.</p> <p> The 27.1-km Nairobi expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model. Full-scale construction of the about 600 million U.S. dollars infrastructure project began in September 2020.</p> <p> Macharia said the expressway has been built in record time because it has been completed one year ahead of schedule, and its impact will be positive on the economy. He observed that the infrastructure project represents a new dawn for Kenya as it will have a very big impact in terms of mobility, especially for motorists traveling between Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Nairobi's central business district.</p> <p> Macharia said the Nairobi expressway is a private investment and therefore the government has not committed any money to the infrastructure project.</p> <p> "The Kenya government has not committed any money on this investment, we have not borrowed a single cent of the total amount of about 600 million U.S. dollars, which is about 70 billion shillings," he said.</p> <p> "The money which the government could have spent here has been now spent elsewhere." According to Macharia, the Nairobi expressway is a good example of the benefits of public-private partnership because it frees up public expenditure for use on social expenditures.</p> <p> "This is the most important thing for Kenyans to know that this public-private partnership is so important, because first of all, you don't borrow and it is not affecting our debt ratio," he added.</p> <p> Ibrahim Doboshek, a motorist, who took part in the trial run, told Xinhua that the standards of the road construction of the expressway are comparable to those in the advanced countries of the world. "I am so grateful because I used to take 2 to 3 hours on Mombasa road due to traffic but today I have used 10 minutes."</p> <p> George Were, another road user, who lives in Kitengela town which is about 30 km southeast of Nairobi's central business district, said that the new expressway is very convenient and fast. "I recommend guys to use it. I know there's the element of cost. But in terms of convenience, I think it is really value for money because a journey that used to take two hours is now down to less than 20 minutes."</p> <p> Before Saturday's trial run, an inaugural city marathon was held on the Nairobi expressway last Sunday, which attracted more than 8,000 runners to participate.</p> <p> "As a result of developing modern infrastructure projects like the Nairobi Expressway, the country will reap multiple benefits chief among them ease of travel, improved trade, investments and environmental health," Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said during the award ceremony for marathon winners.</p> <p> During the construction period, the expressway had created more than 6,000 direct jobs, benefiting 200 sub-contractors and hundreds of other local suppliers of building materials such as steel, sand, cement and ballast.</p> <p> A new job has now emerged in Kenya -- toll attendant on the expressway.</p> <p> "I'm really excited about this job because it impacts positively on the country's development," Rodah Mwenje Okoth, who works as a toll attendant at the Nairobi expressway, told Xinhua that she underwent two months of intensive training before beginning her job.</p> <p> She said the road project has provided a lot of job opportunities to Kenyans while solving traffic congestion in the capital city.</p> <p> Like Okoth, more than 400 toll attendants are now working at the Nairobi Expressway.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL</p> <p> Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.</p> <p> Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.</p> <p> "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."</p> <p> The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."</p> <p> Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.</p> <p> Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."</p> <p> Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.</p> <p> Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.</p> <p> "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.</p> <p> As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.</p> <p> "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.</p> <p> "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.</p> <p> From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.</p> <p> A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p> This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="" src="/NMediaFile/2022/0515/FOREIGN202205150911000108339247797.jpeg" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;" /></p> <p> <em>ASEAN foreign ministers pose for a group photo during the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting (AMM Retreat) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Feb. 17, 2022. (Photo by Sovannara/Xinhua)</em></p> <p> <strong>ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE</strong></p> <p> Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.</p> <p> With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.</p> <p> The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.</p> <p> "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."</p> <p> The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.</p> <p> Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.</p> <p> "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.</p> <p> Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.</p> <p> "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.</p> <p> "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.</p> <p> <strong>VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN</strong></p> <p> It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.</p> <p> Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.</p> <p> "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.</p> <p> Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."</p> <p> "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

"Consider that the European Union's Lisbon Treaty from 2009 includes a clause on mutual, collective defense, just as NATO does."</p> <p> Nicolai von Ondarza, a political scientist and head of the European Union division at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs said Finland and Sweden were never "entirely neutral" when it came to security issues, noting their armed forces already coordinated activities with those from NATO countries and they shared intelligence. Instead, they practiced what he called "armed neutrality" -- meaning they are willing to use military force to maintain their neutrality if needed.</p> <p> "One of the things this will mean is that the Baltic Sea will now become largely a NATO Sea," von Ondarza said in an interview, referring to the body of water in northern Europe surrounded by Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany -- all NATO member states -- in addition to Finland, Sweden, and Russia.</p> <p> "I also think we will see a policy shift when it comes to foreign and military policy that will shift from crisis management to territorial defense," he said.</p> <p> According to LUISS University's Sciso, there could be impacts of the move far beyond Europe. She noted that the Arctic Sea -- a nearly unpopulated region without major land mass thought to contain 160 billion barrels of oil and as much as 30 percent of the planet's natural gas is currently administered by eight countries that border it, five of which are members of NATO: Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United States. Once Finland and Sweden join NATO, that number will be seven of eight, with only Russia outside the alliance.</p> <p> "It's significant because the states that govern the area will be dominated by NATO," Sciso said. "The countries involved are obligated to respect rules agreed to for the region on things ranging from fishing rights to nuclear testing, but they remain sovereign states and two of them are the world's largest nuclear powers."&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> DENVER, the United States, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Grocery store shelves were bare of baby formula around Denver and other cities in the United States Friday as the federal government continued unprecedented steps toward accelerating production and distribution of the vital supplement.</p> <p> U.S. President Joe Biden defended his response to the crisis Friday as Republicans and conservative media attacked his administration's actions.</p> <p> "If we'd been better mind readers I guess we could have (reacted faster)," he told CNN at a press conference.</p> <p> Across the country, mothers took to social media and drove up to 50 miles to look around amid baby food formula shortage, People, an American weekly magazine that specializes in celebrity news and human-interest stories, said Friday, calling the situation "very, very scary."</p> <p> One mother also told the Denver Channel that "my entire family just goes and finds the formula when we they can."</p> <p> "My sister picked me up some in Arvada yesterday, my dad up in Thornton the other day," Ashlee Lane, the mother of a 7-month-old, said of her family's efforts scouring the Denver area for baby formula.</p> <p> Data released this week by Datasembly, which tracks baby formula stock at more than 11,000 stores, showed that 43 percent of the top-selling baby formula products were out of stock as of the week ending May 8, and in five states, more than half of the top-selling formula products were missing from stores.</p> <p> At busy retail giant Target in Boulder, 50 km northwest of Denver, baby formula supplies were scarce and most store shelves were empty on Friday.</p> <p> "Usually they tell us when more is coming in," a store inventory clerk told Xinhua, pointing to her hand-held computer. "But this says zero are coming in and zero are expected soon."</p> <p> Nearby, at high-end grocer Whole Foods, the story was the same, even with non-traditional formula products that catered to mothers with money seeking organic baby food solutions.</p> <p> "We really noticed it in the past week," customer service representative Julian Bell said, "although our stock has been dwindling for several weeks."</p> <p> On Friday, the Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS) website posted that "manufacturers have ramped up production 30-50 percent," and that "yesterday, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including Walmart, Target, Reckitt, and Gerber, to discuss ways to get more formula quickly and safely onto store shelves."</p> <p> HHS pointed to the January recall of "certain powdered infant formulas" by industry leader Abbott Nutrition as a catalyst for the shortages, a federal response to four Michigan babies getting sick from the formula and two infant deaths between September and February.</p> <p> "The reason we're here is because the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) took the steps to ensure that babies were taking safe formula," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a press conference Thursday.</p> <p> "There were babies who died from taking this formula, so they were doing their jobs," Psaki said.</p> <p> Psaki announced a series of measures to alleviate the shortage, including efforts to speed up production and crack down on price gouging, as reports surfaced of individuals buying out store supplies and re-selling them on Ebay for huge profits.</p> <p> The Justice Department is now working with state attorney generals to monitor price-gouging in the formula market, and Biden said Thursday he had asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate reports of price-gouging.</p> <p> The Biden administration is also working to increase imports of formula, a new solution as the United States produces 98 percent of its formula supply, according to an administration fact sheet.</p> <p> On Friday, Biden also called for cutting red tape on the types of formula parents can buy, calling on the FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging and unfair market practices, and increase the supply of formula through increased imports.</p> <p> Congressional Democrats joined the president in demanding answers from baby formula manufacturers.</p> <p> In letters to the heads of four baby formula companies, Democratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney of New York and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois demanded documents and details about the shortage.</p> <p> "The national formula shortage poses a threat to the health and economic security of infants and families in communities throughout the country -- particularly those with less income who have historically experienced health inequities, including food insecurity," they wrote in letters sent to Mead Johnson Nutrition, Nestle USA, Perrigo Company and Abbott Nutrition.</p> <p> These companies control nearly 90 percent of the U.S. market for baby formula, the lawmakers said, requesting certain documents submitted by June 2.</p> <p> REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT THE CRISIS</p> <p> Republican leaders were quick to exploit the baby food crisis for their own political gain, slamming Biden on several fronts.</p> <p> "This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE in America," Elise Stefanik, a New York House Republican, wrote on Twitter. "Sadly, this has become the norm because of Joe Biden's radical agenda."</p> <p> "Unsurprisingly, when I reached out in February from my office to the FDA we received no substantive response. Joe Biden simply has no plan," Stefanik told the media at a press conference Thursday.</p> <p> "Instead, bare shelves. Biden has continued to pass the buck. This is not a Third World country. This should never happen in the United States of America. We're unified in demanding action to address this crisis," she added.</p> <p> Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, joined in: "This is sadly Joe Biden's America."</p> <p> "Working families are already struggling to put food on the table due to the skyrocketing costs of every day items, and now they are facing a crisis that is threatening the very lives of their newborn children," Wagner said.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- About two and a half years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has seen not only an increase in infections and deaths, but also an orgy of racism and hate crimes against minority groups, particularly the Asian-American community.</p> <p> Following an apparently random yet violent murder of a young Korean-American woman in a Chinatown apartment here in February, mourners placed flowers, candles, photos, and cardboard signs condemning anti-Asian hatred around a tree outside the residential building where Christina Yuna Lee was stabbed to death.</p> <p> While the shock of Lee's death had yet to wear off, mourners were outraged that the makeshift memorial for Lee had been repeatedly vandalized.</p> <p> The temporary memorial was first vandalized in the middle of the night just three days after Lee's death, and it continued to be vandalized even in broad daylight.</p> <p> "So five times last month, and it just keeps increasing. It is very sad," Brian Chin, Lee's former landlord, told Xinhua.</p> <p> According to video clips from a surveillance camera shared by Chin, a man kicked at the flowers, candles, and signs in the early morning on March 2, and another pedestrian pulled down a cardboard sign about a week later.</p> <p> Every attack on the memorial is pretty much anti-Asian and "it is very scary right now," said Chin, whose family came to the United States from China over 60 years ago.</p> <p> "They're doing it with hate. They see her picture. They see the flowers and candles," Chin added.</p> <p> Lee's tragic death followed the fatal shoving of Asian American Michelle Alyssa Go onto subway tracks by a man at Times Square station on Jan. 15 and the death of Yaopan Ma in January in a racially motivated attack in East Harlem.</p> <p> "Her (Lee's) death is part of an alarming pattern of unchecked, hateful violence against women, namely women of Asian descent and women of color that can no longer stand without consequence," said one of Lee's relatives in an appeal on Gofundme.com.</p> <p> For Chin, a middle-aged man, the continued anti-Asian hate crimes had brought about unprecedented depression.</p> <p> "I think everyone is terrified right now that they will be attacked on the subways, on the streets, and then the guy will be out on the same day," he said.</p> <p> According to Chin, this wave of anti-Asian hatred began with very vitriolic language which claims COVID-19 as the so-called "Chinese flu" or "Wuhan flu."</p> <p> Kathleen Flynn-hui, whose husband originally came from Hong Kong, said that anti-Asian prejudice affects her family on a daily basis.</p> <p> "We've kind of always felt it, but not as strongly as now," said Flynn-hui, adding that she "dealt with discrimination against my husband because he was Asian the whole time."</p> <p> Chin said the situation is deteriorating due to a combination of politics, the impact of new laws, and the new Manhattan District Attorney's lenient stance on crime.</p> <p> "The cops are doing their job, but they arrest them, and they're free the next day due to the laws," said Chin.</p> <p> Right now, much stronger laws are needed to protect the Asian community, Chin said, calling on lawmakers, the city council, and the mayor to take stronger and more enforceable action.</p> <p> The Committee of 100, a non-profit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans, recently called on U.S. elected officials, law enforcement, and responsible media to address racism, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders immediately with actionable and concrete results.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded U.S.-ASEAN summit will not draw regional countries closer to the U.S. side, and the U.S. attempt to court support among ASEAN in pursuit of its geopolitical interests is unlikely to gain traction, experts have said.</p> <p> U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.</p> <p> U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL</p> <p> Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.</p> <p> Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.</p> <p> "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."</p> <p> The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."</p> <p> Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.</p> <p> Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."</p> <p> Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.</p> <p> Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.</p> <p> "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.</p> <p> As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.</p> <p> "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.</p> <p> "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.</p> <p> From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.</p> <p> A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p> This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."</p> <p> ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE</p> <p> Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.</p> <p> With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.</p> <p> The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.</p> <p> "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."</p> <p> The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.</p> <p> Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.</p> <p> "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.</p> <p> Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.</p> <p> "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.</p> <p> "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.</p> <p> VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN</p> <p> It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.</p> <p> Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.</p> <p> "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.</p> <p> Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."</p> <p> "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been exploiting democracy, human rights and aid as tools and weapons to incite division around the world and meddle in other countries' internal affairs, say political experts.</p> <p> "To influence domestic policies in recipient countries ... the U.S. has provided assistance to serve its goals and achieve its interests," Ayman Okeil, general manager of the Cairo-based Maat for Peace, Development, and Human Rights, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p> <p> THE NED AS A PROXY</p> <p> Among all the proxies Washington uses to serve its political agenda in other countries, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was founded in 1983 as a bipartisan, non-profit institution by the U.S. government, is one of the most active.</p> <p> Nominally a non-governmental organization that provides support for democracy abroad, the NED in fact relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the U.S. Congress, and takes orders from the U.S. government.</p> <p> Okeil described the NED as one of Washington's "soldiers" for interfering in other countries' decision-making process.</p> <p> The NED has worked as a substitute for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cultivating pro-U.S. opposition activists for subverting lawful governments and provoking uprisings in the Arab countries under the pretext of promoting democracy, he said.</p> <p> According to Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, the NED was founded as a tool for projecting political influence in different sovereign states that the U.S. government has labeled as "non-democratic, totalitarian, authoritarian and anti-American."</p> <p> The NED supported opposition groups in other countries, which were trained to represent Washington's interest, rather than the vital interests of their own nations and states, Rawashdeh pointed out.</p> <p> Echoing Rawashdeh's point, Okeil said that the NED has spent millions of U.S. dollars to support political parties, labor unions, dissident movements, and media in dozens of countries.</p> <p> The organization has been employed as the "mastermind" behind separatist riots, color revolutions, and political crises around the world, with the aim of toppling legitimate governments and creating U.S. puppets in targeted countries, said Ahmad Ashqar, a Syrian journalist and political expert.</p> <p> The NED makes sure that nations across the globe do what the United States wants them to do and in no way feel confident and capable of pursuing their own political/ideological agendas, Rawashdeh said. "And this is also what the U.S. foreign policy is doing for decades."</p> <p> A NEW TYPE OF IMPERIALISM</p> <p> The United States, unfortunately, has created a new type of imperialism, by occupying foreign countries with money and forces and interfering in their choice of leaders and party compositions, Okeil told Xinhua.</p> <p> Unlike the funds that came from some countries like China, which help improve health, education and development sectors, the U.S. economic aid is always with conditions attached, he noted</p> <p> Okeil's words are not groundless. According to a study by the American University in Cairo in November 2021, the NED has allocated more than 606 million dollars in "democracy assistance" to Egypt in the period between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the U.S. government provided 415 million dollars in economic assistance to Egypt, which includes 55 million dollars to support programs for promoting democracy.</p> <p> However, as Tariq Fahmy, a political science professor at the Cairo University, noted, the U.S. mode of democracy has not been successful in the Middle East, and it contradicts many countries' unique conditions.</p> <p> "We all saw the disgraceful role in provoking the Arab Spring via funding the protesters" under the cover of democracy and human rights, Fahmy said, explaining that such kind of imposed democracy couldn't breed stability.</p> <p> After the Arab Spring, many people in the Middle East have started to see the real objectives behind the U.S. aid when knowing that Washington had a role in inciting the Arab Spring uprisings via supporting, training and funding young protesters, Okeil noted.</p> <p> The U.S. model of democracy is not suitable for the world, and based on that model, the U.S. policies led to real crimes, Fahmy said.</p> <p> It's a fact that the United States has distorted the positive meaning of democracy and emptied such a notion of anything useful and beneficial for other countries, Ashqar argued.</p> <p> "We have seen several examples like in Syria, where the United States used democracy as a pretext to support separatist forces and radical ones to destabilize the legitimate government," he said. "The U.S. presence in Syria has achieved all but the so-called democracy."</p> <p> "Under the pretext of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy, the U.S. has stolen key areas in Syria rich with oil and gas, do you call that democracy?" asked the Syrian journalist.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Cash assistance has been provided to over 655,000 people, allowing them to cover some of their most basic needs, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).</p> <p> More than 1.5 million people have received health care support, and around 352,000 people have been provided with clean water and hygiene products. Nearly 430,000 people have received protection services, psychosocial support and critical legal services, including support to internally displaced persons, it said.</p> <p> Despite this remarkable scale-up, many more people urgently need support, including those living in areas experiencing heavy fighting. The United Nations urges parties to the conflict to remove any barriers to the movement of humanitarian staff to ensure the continued delivery of life-saving assistance across Ukraine, said OCHA.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

Its disrespect for ASEAN members concerning scheduling issues despite its pledge of "enduring commitment" has sparked a wave of complaints among ASEAN members, resulting in a postponement of the summit from late March to May.</p> <p> Cambodian Minister attached to the Prime Minister Kao Kim Hourn said before the summit that if Washington was serious about improving its ties with ASEAN, it should have arranged bilateral meetings between the United States and ASEAN countries. ASEAN leaders "should be treated with respect and equality," he noted.</p> <p> The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements. The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.</p> <p> Many sober minds in ASEAN have seen through this duplicity and bullying. Indonesia and Malaysia warned that AUKUS could lead to a major arms race in the region. A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."</p> <p align="center"> <img alt="" src="/mediafile/pic/BIG/20220514/71/5892171399547127135.jpg" /></p> <p> <em>Photo taken on March 24, 2022 shows the U.S. national flag (R) on the U.S. Embassy building in Moscow, Russia. (Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)</em></p> <p> Meanwhile, the White House will attempt in vain during this summit to talk ASEAN into imposing sanctions against Russia. Ever since the escalation of the current Ukraine crisis, Washington has been trying to exert pressure on ASEAN to take sides, but most of ASEAN members did not follow suit.</p> <p> On April 7, six of the 10-member bloc abstained from voting in favor of a resolution to remove Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and two voted against it. Long adhering to an independent foreign policy, ASEAN members have urged solving the crisis through negotiation and dialogue.</p> <p> Moreover, some ASEAN members have been well aware of Washington's unspoken calculations to turn bloody sufferings of others into golden opportunities for profits in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during his visit to China in early April, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said he appreciates China's objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, that "Asian countries should maintain peace and stability in the region, jointly resist unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law, and prevent attempts to create tensions and replicate crises in the region."</p> <p> Playing small clique politics and forcing others to take sides -- Washington's old tricks to gain geopolitical interests -- work against ASEAN's will to uphold regional peace and stability and to realize sustainable economic development. Launching trade wars and breaking pacts -- Washington's classical acts of unilateralism -- severely disrupt normal trade exchanges and supply chains in the region and deal a heavy blow to ASEAN's economy. All those wrongdoings have tarnished Washington's credit and influence as the world's sole superpower, and driven it further apart from ASEAN members.</p> <p> The long arc of history teaches each and every country that acting without scruples almost always results in the reverse of what one desires. It is time for Washington to learn this lesson, abandon its old dream of Cold War hegemony, uphold an open and inclusive mindset, and play its due role in maintaining regional and global peace, stability and development.&nbsp;</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

The Green Party's basic attitude towards NATO has not changed." Maria Ferm, member of the Green Party, told Swedish Television, emphasizing her party's opposition to joining NATO.</p> <p> "We have therefore submitted a special opinion about this issue and about this analysis, because we do not agree with all the wording about NATO this analysis contains," Ferm emphasized.</p> <p> "I think there is no analysis of the risks that a Swedish NATO membership entails." Hakan Svenneling, a member of the Left Party told Swedish Television, "We are making the biggest change in Swedish security policy in a very long time. And freedom of alliance has been very important and served Sweden well for a long time, and could do so for a long time to come."</p> <p> "I am worried that every major conflict for a long time to come, for decades, will take place at Sweden's borders or in Sweden.

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> KUALA LUMPUR, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden is meeting with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at a summit in Washington this week, in a move widely seen as an attempt by the United States to pull members of the bloc into its camp.</p> <p> Analysts believe that U.S. attempts to court support among ASEAN leaders in pursuit of its geopolitical interests are unlikely to gain traction.</p> <p> ASEAN leaders are more likely to emphasize their economic interests, analysts have said, adding the bloc members, who are seeking a post-pandemic economic recovery, will put ASEAN centrality at the forefront while deflecting any attempt to draw them into a U.S. sphere of influence.</p> <p> The summit officially commemorates 45 years of U.S.-ASEAN ties. It was initially scheduled for late March but was postponed due to scheduling issues.</p> <p> Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research, said Wednesday that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) last month.</p> <p> "I think President Biden must be wondering why ASEAN nation did not outright condemn Russia and did not support it wholeheartedly. This can especially be seen during the resolution to remove Russia from the UNHRC on April 7: Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and Brunei abstained while Vietnam and Laos voted against it," Hassan told Xinhua in a phone interview.</p> <p> He also said that the United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain.</p> <p> "Overall, despite the ideas of geopolitical maneuvering, I think the most important issue that will be discussed among the participants will be the economic side, how to spur the trade between ASEAN and the U.S. post-pandemic. I think that will be the most important subject matter from ASEAN point of view," he said.</p> <p> Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said that while the summit is happening against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.</p> <p> "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea. Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries," she said.</p> <p> "ASEAN members can already anticipate that the summit is ideal for the Biden administration to stress the common interests and shared values between the U.S. and the ASEAN countries. The U.S. is expected to leverage these ideas to draw ASEAN closer to them," she added.</p> <p> Lee cautioned that unless it can demonstrate unity, the ASEAN bloc may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness. This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States.</p> <p> "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," Lee said. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Greg Powers had never expected to see a major public health crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic, in his lifetime. "It's just absolutely mind-boggling," he told Xinhua when describing his feeling of living through it. "It's surreal."</p> <p> The once-in-a-century pandemic has unimaginably claimed 1 million lives out of more than 82 million infections in the United States over the past two years or so, and changed the nation -- and the rest of the world -- in ways big and small.</p> <p> For Powers, an African American audio engineer who lives with his family in Arlington County, Virginia, on the East Coast, there has been no shortage of challenges because most of his assignments need to be worked on in studios -- forcing him to travel between home and workplace, which expose him to greater risks of catching the virus.</p> <p> To protect himself and also those around him, Powers masks up wherever he goes, although most Americans are no longer required to cover their faces indoors in public areas.</p> <p> Besides, in the first year of the pandemic, Powers wore gloves every single day at work when touching his equipment. He and his wife also chose to go to the pharmacy or grocery store late at night or very early in the morning to avoid contact with the crowd as much as possible.</p> <p> "I'm not catching COVID though it's still out there," Powers said of his precaution. "I don't really have any physical ailments ... I have loved ones who have it. So it's a situation where I want to be as safe as possible, and I'll keep my family safe."</p> <p> Powers, who has been fully vaccinated and received a booster shot, said the fact that there has been an obvious hesitancy among the African American community toward the vaccines is partly due to Washington's notorious record of using them to conduct medical experiments.</p> <p> Powers particularly referred to the infamous "Tuskegee Experiment" that began in 1932, in which hundreds of African Americans were recruited by doctors from the U.S. Public Health Service for a study to track the full progression of syphilis without effective care. In 1997, the White House issued a formal presidential apology for the study which was terminated in the 1970s. "They basically used people as Guinea pigs," Powers deplored. "There's a lot of distrust."</p> <p> Though Powers said he believes most African Americans "have gotten beyond that" and tried to be vaccinated in this pandemic, he would still feel "relatively safe" if he could see "a whole bunch of different people from different races and cultures" in the line for a vaccination.</p> <p> The vaccine hesitancy, along with an unequal distribution of healthcare and other resources, has contributed to the pandemic's disproportionate impact on African Americans who are more likely to suffer from preexisting medical conditions like obesity and diabetes, and who work as "essential workers" but are less likely to be insured than white people in the nation.</p> <p> In Washington, D.C., located just across the Potomac River from Arlington County, African Americans account for roughly half of the population, but nearly four in five COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. capital. In the first few months of the U.S. vaccine rollout, African Americans received shots at a much lower rate than their white peers.</p> <p> "Well, racial inequality was baked into the recipe of the creation of the United States of America," Rashawn Ray, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, wrote in an analysis published in April 2020.</p> <p> "Inequities in neighborhood resources and the healthcare system are manifestations of this recipe," warned Ray, also an African American. "And, when crises like the COVID-19 pandemic occur, inequalities are exacerbated rather than diminished."</p> <p> The disparities are even more pronounced in some suburban areas of the country. Bree Hartfield, born and reared in Beaumont, Mississippi, told Xinhua that there is only "a nurse practitioner but no doctor on staff" in the small town where she has seen "a lot of deaths, a lot of tragedies" throughout the pandemic.</p> <p> "African Americans do succumb to illnesses in a different way because of the lack of resources, the lack of opportunities to get the resources," Hartfield noted, attributing the phenomenon to "inequitable resources" and a lack of good leadership. "So equitable resources are what we would need to implement, especially into the small towns where I think money doesn't reach," she said.</p> <p> The pandemic has already taken a backseat in the United States to soaring inflation and the Ukraine crisis, as states and cities have lifted anti-pandemic restrictions. But Powers continues to see it as an issue "in the forefront" for him and "a tough situation," because "there are still people who are testing positive."</p> <p> U.S. President Joe Biden ordered flags at half-staff on Thursday to commemorate the deaths of 1 million Americans who lost their lives to COVID-19.</p> <p> "Today, we mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to COVID-19," Biden said in a statement. "One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed because of this pandemic."</p> <p> COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are on the rise in the United States, with new related deaths projected to resurge in coming weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "We are still in the middle of a pandemic, to be sure -- there's no confusion about that," top U.S. infectious disease expert and White House chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci has recently said.</p> <p> "COVID didn't have to kill most who died from it," former U.S. CDC Director and epidemiologist Tom Frieden tweeted on Thursday. "At least half of U.S. COVID deaths in 2020 were preventable through better public health action, and more than half of 2021 deaths were preventable through improved vaccination. We can save lives by taking reasonable precautions."</p> <p> Speaking of the nation's loss of more than 1 million lives to the pandemic, Hartfield said it is "an astronomical number" and that "it is terrible."</p> <p> "I do wish all the blessings for those families," she added. "But I just think this is an opportunity to reflect on the things that we could do better as a country."</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> BRUSSELS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Thursday proposed to establish new so-called "solidarity lanes" to ensure that Ukraine can export grain to the European Union (EU) and also import the goods it needs, from humanitarian aid to animal feed and fertilizers, as Ukraine's ports have been blocked due to Russia-Ukraine.</p> <p> Ukraine's inability to export its agricultural produce through Black Sea ports because of the blockade is threatening global food security and has prompted the development of an action plan to overcome this hurdle, the Commission said in a statement.</p> <p> Under normal circumstances, Ukraine exports 75 percent of the grain it produces, generating around 20 percent of its annual export revenues. Before the conflict, Ukraine's Black Sea ports handled 90 percent of its grain and oilseed exports.</p> <p> "Twenty million tonnes of grains have to leave Ukraine in less than three months using the EU infrastructure," Transport Commissioner Adina Valean said in a statement. "This is a gigantesque challenge, so it is essential to coordinate and optimize the logistic chains, put in place new routes and avoid, as much as possible, the bottlenecks."</p> <p> The Commission said that in spite of immediate efforts by the EU and its member states to ease border crossings between Ukraine and the EU, thousands of wagons and lorries are waiting for clearance on the Ukrainian side. The average current waiting time for wagons is 16 days, while it is up to 30 days at some borders. More grain is still stored and held back in Ukrainian silos ready for export.</p> <p> Among the challenges are differing rail gauge widths since the wagons used in Ukraine are not compatible with most of the EU rail network, so most goods need to be transhipped to lorries or wagons that fit the EU standard gauge.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Hospital labor expenses have increased by more than one-third from pre-pandemic levels in the United States, according to a new report.</p> <p> The report, released by U.S. healthcare consultancy company Kaufman Hall on Wednesday, noted that a nationwide shortage of healthcare workers made worse by the pandemic, and hospital and health systems' increased reliance on contract labor, is driving expenses upward and contributing to steep declines in profit margins.</p> <p> During the pandemic, almost one in five healthcare workers quit their jobs. One-third of nurses plan to leave their current roles by the end of 2022, with more than a quarter of those intending to become traveling nurses, according to the report, titled "The Financial Effects of Hospital Workforce Dislocation: A Special Workforce Edition of the National Hospital Flash Report."</p> <p> Contract labor as a percentage of total labor expenses increased more than five times the rate from pre-pandemic levels, said the report.</p> <p> Pre-pandemic, wage rates for contract nurses were almost double those for employed nurses. As the pandemic continued and labor shortages intensified, that wage gap increased significantly. As of March 2022, the median wage rate for contract nurses had risen to more than three times that of employed nurses, the report added.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>

	<full-text><![CDATA[ <p> NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of wealthy Americans applying for citizenship or residency in foreign countries has skyrocketed over the past three years as U.S. billionaires, tech entrepreneurs and celebrities look to create a "plan B" for their families, reported major news portal Insider last week, based on interviews with multiple investment migration firms.</p> <p> Latitude Residency &amp; Citizenship, a company which guides high-net-worth investors around the world through the application process, was quoted as saying that U.S. inquiries have increased 300 percent between 2019 and 2021.</p> <p> Henley &amp; Partners, one of the world's largest citizenship brokers, said sales to American nationals increased by 327 percent between 2019 and 2020 and an additional 10 percent in 2021.</p> <p> According to Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley &amp; Partners, there are "four C's" currently driving the investor citizenship industry: COVID-19, climate change, cryptocurrency, and conflict. The recent uptick in American applicants started during the Trump administration and escalated during pandemic lockdowns, he said.</p> <p> "In the very strict lockdowns there was a point where if you only had an American passport, you could not enter Europe," said Volek. "I think that made a lot of particularly ultra high net worth individuals realize that they're potentially a little bit more fragile than they thought."</p> <p> More than a dozen countries offer so-called "golden passports" and visas that allow affluent foreigners to receive citizenship or residency in exchange for investing in the country. The most expensive programs range from 1.1 million U.S. dollars in Malta to 9.5 million dollars in Austria, the Insider report said, citing Forbes.</p> <p id='org_name'>Source: Xinhua</p> ]]></full-text>
