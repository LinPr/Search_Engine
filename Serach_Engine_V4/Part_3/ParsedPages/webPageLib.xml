The exhibition showcased more than 1,000 images of ancient Chinese women from 32 museums. (Photo/Zhejiang Provincial Museum)  Many Chinese museums, art galleries and other cultural and art institutions have ramped up efforts to leverage digital technologies for better development. Based on their characteristic resources, they have rolled out online exhibitions, courses, and other online services, allowing netizens to take virtual tours and enjoy splendid art feasts online.  Zhejiang Provincial Museum launched an online exhibition that showcased more than 1,000 images of ancient Chinese women from 32 museums. Meanwhile, it carried out an online interaction activity, attracting active participation of netizens.  “You can also take part in our photography collection activity during this online exhibition. We are looking forward to your sharing photos of yourselves in traditional Chinese clothes like Hanfu and Qipao on social media platforms,” said a manager of the museum.  Excellent online exhibitions couldn’t have been possible without strong technological support. As 5G, virtual reality (VR), 360-degree panoramic tour and other digital technologies are widely employed in cultural property exhibitions, museums have explored more diversified and interesting forms in interacting with the public.  “Art exhibitions have embraced dramatic changes thanks to Internet technologies. They bring new experiences featuring high-definition, three-dimension and interactive products and services to the public, and help show exhibits clearly to people with detailed display, voice introduction and three-dimensional methods,” said Yu Kailiang, professor at the aesthetics teaching and research office under the School of Philosophy, Renmin University of China.  The Yungang Grottoes located in Datong city, north China’s Shanxi province, are famous in the world for their magnificence, exquisite craftsmanship and unique charm.  Thanks to digital technologies, visitors are able to appreciate the Yungang Grottoes remotely by wearing VR headset, which can help vividly present the grottoes and statues.

The Yungang Grottoes Research Institute has completed a project for the digital collection of typical grottoes in the Yungang Grottoes. Through cooperation with colleges and universities including Zhejiang University and Wuhan University, the institute has also used 3D printing, VR and other high technologies to introduce the Yungang Grottoes cultural relics to the world.  Based on augmented reality (AR) and VR technologies, the National Museum of China held an online exhibition and built virtual exhibition halls to reproduce historical occasions in Chinese history along the road to rejuvenation, expanding the exhibition space for viewers.  The China (Hainan) Museum of the South China Sea allows visitors to enjoy beautiful sunrise and sunset in the island province Hainan through livestreaming empowered by 5G and VR.  The Shanxi Museum provided online 360-degree panoramic tours, e-books, high-definition pictures and audio tours of its exquisite exhibitions over the years to meet the diverse needs of the audience.  On Digital Dunhuang, a digital platform for the exhibition of the Mogao Grottoes, the exquisite pictures of the grottoes can be magnified, allowing netizens to see clearly even the mottled cracks on the wall. Detailed descriptions are added to introduce the story and artistic value of each grotto, painted sculpture and mural. “The murals seem so real and clear that I feel like I can almost touch them,” a netizen commented.  Online exhibition is not only about moving physical exhibitions onto online platforms, but about innovating exhibitions forms with online resources.  In recent years, China has rolled out a series of targeted measures to promote the development of online exhibitions.

One month later, nine government departments in China, including the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science and Technology, jointly issued guidelines on driving the reform and development of museums, which stressed that the country would support joint exhibitions, online display and increase exposure of collections.  In December last year, the State Council issued a development plan for digital economy during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, which encouraged scenic spots and museums to develop online digital experience products as well as new cultural tourism services such as online exhibitions and immersive experiences.  By connecting the organization, participation, sharing and communication of online exhibitions links, resources in the museum industry will be integrated to a high limit, which gives the public more opportunities to enjoy the charm of culture.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo courtesy of Jingzhou Museum)  Jingzhou city in central China’s Hubei Province has revitalized its time-honored Chu-style lacquer decoration technique, which was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage (ICH) item in 2011, by applying innovative approaches to the craft in recent years, making it even more charming.  For thousands of years, the Chu-style lacquer decoration technique has been passed down from generation to generation in Hubei, which was part of the Chu State during the Spring and Autumn Period (770 – 476 B.C.) and the ensuing Warring States Period (475 – 221 B.C.) in ancient China.  In 2012, an institute dedicated to passing Jingchu intangible cultural heritage craftsmanship down was established. The institute encompasses workshops dedicated to the protection, inheritance and learning of ICH, as well as the production of relevant products, covering 18 national ICH items, including the Chu-style lacquer decoration technique, and 12 provincial-level items, according to Zhou Jing, director of the intangible cultural heritage protection center of the city.  At the institute, people can appreciate exquisite lacquerware items and witness the process for making lacquerware. The institute has served as a platform for ICH demonstration and inheritance, as well as for the production of ICH-related products, with many craftsmen making ICH works there, said Xu Xiaolan, president of the institute.  Meanwhile, the institute, affiliated to Changjiang Polytechnic of Art and Engineering, has hired ICH inheritors to teach students, replacing the traditional master-apprentice model with a modern apprenticeship program. In 2013, the polytechnic opened a major related to traditional crafts to cultivate inheritors of ICH items and traditional crafts.  The polytechnic has trained close to 1,000 students in this way in recent years, about 200 of whom have started their own businesses or have become partners of the institute.  Ma Guangbo, born after 2000, is a student majoring in the Chu-style lacquer decoration technique at the polytechnic. Ma won the first prize for making lacquerware during a national vocational skills competition in 2020.  Zou Dexiang, a national-level inheritor of the Chu-style lacquer decoration technique, is also a teacher at the polytechnic. According to Zou, making a piece of lacquerware involves about 20 steps, including choosing the proper materials, carving, polishing, lacquering, and tracing a design in gold. Zou spends about 200 hours teaching students at the polytechnic every year.  In 2017, a traditional craft workstation was set up in Jingzhou, aiming to revitalize traditional crafts represented by the Chu-style lacquer decoration technique. By introducing new technologies, designs and academic resources, the workstation has developed its own raw lacquer deep-processing technology, as well as green, cultural and innovative products that combine the lacquer technique with modern life.  Two years later, the workstation and the institute built a lacquer culture brand. “Our cultural and innovative products should be both practical and of artistic value,” said Xu.  By applying the Chu-style lacquer decoration technique, teachers and students from the institute, ICH inheritors and designers from universities including Tsinghua University have developed a variety of lacquerware products and innovative products with Chu-style cultural elements, including tablewares, tea wares, pens, and decorations.  In recent years, the institute has continued to expand its sales channels for ICH-related products. The institute’s annual sales volume for lacquered guqin, a traditional Chinese musical instrument, has reached about 20 million yuan (about $2.95 million), and that of lacquerware and cultural products has hit about 10 million yuan. The institute’s annual volume of orders for customized lacquerware has now approached 20 million yuan.  Besides, a whole industry chain that integrates lacquerware making, culture, tourism and lacquer processing has been taking shape in Jingzhou.  The institute began to launch experiential courses on handicrafts and lacquer art in 2015, attracting over 50,000 students and tourists each year.  The inheritance and development of the traditional lacquer technique has also driven the development of the lacquer tree-planting industry and the raw lacquer processing industry in Hubei. In 2018, the traditional craft workstation established a lacquer tree planting base in the province’s Zhuxi county, Shiyan city. Moreover, the workstation started the construction of a workshop that processes raw lacquer and colored lacquer in Badong county in 2019. Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

The house looks just like an ordinary rural house, only it has a library in it.    Lin Yuekeng, owner of a public-interest library in Makeng village, Baisha township, Minhou county, Fuzhou city, east China’s Fujian province, arranges books on a bookshelf. (Photo/WeChat account of the publicity department of the Communist Party of China Minhou county committee)  A sign hanging at the door of the house reads “Baishawan Library”. The sign has faded a bit, but the name of library is well-known to locals.  Baishawan Library was started by Lin Lixing, father of a local villager named Lin Yuekeng. In 2011, Lin Lixing visited a library in a neighboring township, and saw villagers read and study there. Deeply inspired by what he saw, he quickly transformed the first floor of his house into the public-interest library after he returned home.  As the first library in Baisha township, Baishawan Library has been popular since it opened. According to Lin Yuekeng, visitors crowded the library on its first day.  It greatly gratified Lin Lixing, who was in his seventies then, to see that the library was full of students between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. every day. Taking delight in helping children enjoy books, he was busy working in the library all day and didn’t have time to take a noon break. At night, after the last reader left, he started to rearrange books.    Lin Yuekeng (first from right) helps villagers look up information in books. (Photo/WeChat account of the publicity department of the Communist Party of China Minhou county committee)  In the third year after the opening of the library, Lin Lixing passed away. After his father’s death, Lin Yuekeng hesitated about continuing to run the library. “The library is completely non-profit and requires a lot of manpower and material resources,” explained Lin Yuekeng.  But he finally decided to keep it running, considering his fellow villagers’ thirst for knowledge and his father’s last wish.  “With this library, we don’t have to go to the urban areas of Fuzhou city to read books or buy books ourselves, because we can read here to increase our knowledge for free,” said Chen Meifang, a villager who is a regular of the library.  Now is the busiest time of the year for citrus growers, including Chen. After spraying her fruit trees with pesticide in the morning, Chen, still in her sun hat and muddy shoes and clothes, went straight to the library eagerly. She found a book on green measures to prevent and control citrus diseases and insect pests and started reading.  “The book has everything I need to know. For example, what&nbsp;fertilizer should be applied, what pesticide should be used, and what precautions should be taken at each stage, from sprouting and blooming to fruiting, are clearly written in it,” Chen said.  In 2006, Chen planted only dozens of mu (one mu equals about 666 square meters) of navel orange trees. As her knowledge of and experience in navel orange tree planting increase, she has become a major grower and an expert in the field in Makeng village.  Her “business” could not have flourished so well without Baishawan Library, according to Chen.  “I’ll take this book home to read. Could you get me a book on growing peach trees? I got the use right of more than 100 mu of farmlands this year, and I’m going to plant peach trees,” Chen said to Lin Yuekeng.    Villagers read at Baishawan Library, a public-interest library run by a local family in Makeng village, Baisha township, Minhou county, Fuzhou city, east China’s Fujian province. (Photo/WeChat account of the publicity department of the Communist Party of China Minhou county committee)  “No problem. Just come and take it next week,” Lin replied.  The library purchases books based on the requirements of residents. Villagers tell the library what books they need, and the library then help get the books for them.  Over the past 11 years, the number of bookshelves in the library has increased from one to more than 20, and the number of books has risen from 2,000 to over 30,000 in 18 categories, making the public-interest rural library with the largest collection of books in Minhou county.  Almost every family of the nearly 400 households in Makeng village has the phone number of Lin Yuekeng. Villagers give him a call anytime they need new books. Lin works in Baisha township from Monday to Friday. He buys the books his fellow villagers need in the township and takes them to the library every Friday after work.  “My trunk is often stuffed with books. Sometimes I also buy books online,” Lin told People’s Daily.  Today, besides residents of Makeng village, many construction workers nearby also read and borrow books from Baishawan Library, which has brought knowledge and companionship to nearly 10,000 people living in the three or four surrounding villages.  The small library has received support from many people, according to Lin, who disclosed that many villagers and college students living nearby have worked as volunteers in the library, and many people, public institutions, and enterprises have donated books and bookshelves to the library.  The popular reading parties and sharing activities held regularly at the library have attracted and benefited many participants.  Though the library requires a lot of efforts, Lin and his family will stick to the rewarding cause so as to attract more people to reading, according to him.

(People's Daily Online/Qin Xin)  An ancient port located in Hepu county of Beihai, southwest China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is one of the three ports of departure for the Maritime Silk Road, which dates back to the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD).  The port city has been a place known for its burgeoning traffic and thriving businesses throughout Chinese history. Its prosperity is recorded in over 20,000 relics, 1,300 antiques and 1,200 ancient tombs discovered in the locality.

(Photo/Xinhua)&nbsp;  Chinese museums and galleries have accelerated their digital transformation and have rolled out online exhibitions through the application of digital technologies while exploring innovative ways to display their exhibits, regaling visitors with a cultural feast both online and offline.  An exhibition featuring about 1,000 ancient female-themed paintings from 32 museums across China was held both offline and online at the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in Hangzhou, capital city of east China’s Zhejiang Province between March 8 and May 8. The museum encouraged Internet users to post photos of themselves wearing traditional Chinese clothes on social media platforms such as Weibo and Xiaohongshu, engaging in active interactions with them online.  “You can tour the digital exhibition hall and find the traditional clothes you like,” a netizen commented.  Chinese museums have also offered online services such as online courses so that visitors can learn more about cultural relics. For example, a guide of the Shanghai Museum took visitors on a virtual tour of the museum’s exhibition of 100 donated cultural relics, through which they could not only enjoy these relics but also learn about the historical and the cultural connotations behind them.  Digital technologies bring cultural relics back to life virtually. With the help of virtual reality (VR) devices, people now can virtually visit the Yungang Grottoes in Datong city, north China’s Shanxi Province, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site.  Besides, the Yungang Grottoes Research Institute has cooperated with universities including Zhejiang University in Zhejiang and Wuhan University in central China’s Hubei Province to bring the cultural relics of the grottoes to a wider audience by applying 3D printing technology and VR technology.  Online exhibitions will be able to free cultural relics housed at museums from constraints based on time and space, while providing added convenience for attracting more viewers, according to Wang Yanlong, director of the center for cultural communication studies of Sichuan University in Chengdu, capital of southwest China’s Sichuan Province.  Internet technologies have brought a tremendous change to art exhibitions, bringing high-definition, three-dimensional, and interactive experiences for people, said Yu Kailiang, a professor at the School of Philosophy at Renmin University of China.  China has rolled out measures to encourage more online exhibitions. According to a plan for the development of culture and tourism between 2021 and 2025 released by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in April 2021, China intends to continually promote the digital transformation of art galleries and online exhibitions.  One month later, nine government authorities that included the Ministry of Science and Technology issued a guideline to advance the reform and development of museums, encouraging online exhibitions and cooperation among museums.  China will boost the development of online digital products for scenic spots and museums and develop new cultural and tourism services such as online exhibitions and immersive experiences, according to a plan issued by China’s State Council in December 2021 to facilitate the development of the digital economy during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025).&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Some students and staffers of the Confucius Institute put up performances, including sword dance, Sichuan Opera and Chinese songs.  The institute also organized some games such as using Chinese chopsticks to pick up beans. Those who won the games received Chinese knots as rewards.  Chu Beijuan, the Chinese dean of the Confucius Institute, said the event was part of the efforts to deepen the friendly ties between China and Ghana.  "We will include calligraphy, martial arts, and other forms of Chinese culture in our Chinese language courses, because we want more people to understand the Chinese language and culture," she added.  Henry Nii Adjiri Quarcoopome, a student from the Confucius Institute at the University of Ghana, told Xinhua that learning Chinese has become an imperative for students who seek employment in the labor market after school.  "Gradually, we will be interacting with Chinese people for our construction and other economic activities," Quarcoopome said.  Pascalina Arthur, another student, said the Confucius Institute has been bridging the cultural gap between Ghana and China.  "The friendly attitude of the Chinese language teachers deepens the interest of students in the language and makes them develop a love for the Chinese language," she said.

It offers a closer look at these treasures and a deeper understanding of history.  　　Among the over 5,200 pieces of relics on display, most are exhibited to the public for the first time.  　　An exquisite headgear dating to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) decorated with gold, silver, pearls, and jade has hogged the limelight. It is the first headgear in that dynasty successfully restored in China.  　　Next to it, four pictures show the scenes when it was first discovered. The headgear was scattered beside a skeleton and broken into hundreds of pieces overlaid with each other. Archaeologists brought them all into the laboratory.  　　With the help of micrographs, archaeologists located the original position of each fragment and restored them layer by layer. The whole process is elaborated to visitors in words and pictures. Excavation tools and a microscope for the restored headgear are also on display.  　　This headgear is also the first to be restored through laboratory microscopic technologies in China.  　　Another eye-catching exhibit is a bronze chariot dating from the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 B.C.).  　　Unearthed in the Zhouyuan site, Baoji City, the bronze chariot was a luxurious vehicle for dignitaries. The wheels are bronze, and the carriage is decorated with hundreds of bronze components inlaid with turquoise.  　　Archaeologists "packaged" the whole excavation site to the laboratory and spent three years cleaning and restoring the chariot. The entire site is now on display in the museum.  　　"3D models, touch screens, and other interactive devices in the museum can demonstrate extensive information about the archaeological research, the history, and the arduous work done by archaeologists," said Hu Xiaoyu, director of the exhibition department of the museum.  　　"The museum gathers archaeological excavations, relics preservation, exhibitions, and public education together to offer the public a closer look at archaeological research and our achievements in the field," said Sun Zhouyong, curator of the museum.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Zhou Hua)  　　NANNING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A cave exploration team has discovered a giant karst sinkhole in Leye County, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, bringing Leye's number of such sinkholes to 30.  　　Zhang Yuanhai, a senior engineer with the Institute of Karst Geology of China Geological Survey, said the sinkhole, located near Ping'e village under Luoxi township, measures 306 m in length, 150 m in width and 192 m in depth, with its volume exceeding 5 million cubic meters, and can be categorized as a large sinkhole.  　　Zhang said that there are three big caves in the wall, which are presumed to be the remains of the early evolution of the sinkhole. The bottom of the sinkhole has a well-preserved primitive forest.  　　Chen Lixin, leader of the Guangxi 702 cave expedition team, said the ancient trees growing at the bottom are nearly 40 meters high, and the dense shade plants are up to one's shoulders.  　　The expedition was completed on Friday, after the team members abseiled down more than 100 meters and trekked several hours to reach the pit's bottom. They returned to the ground safely on Friday evening.  　　Giant sinkholes, also known as Tiankeng (heavenly pit) in Chinese, are dolines, or giant pits, with special geological features found in karst regions formed by repeated cave-ins. They are mainly found in China, Mexico and Papua New Guinea.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Huang Wanqing/Xinhua)  KIGALI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of residents in eastern Rwanda once did not have easy access to clean and safe water due to recurrent drought.  In the Rwinkwavu area in Kayonza district, Eastern Province, for instance, residents were forced to walk long distances to reach the nearest clean water source.  Water woes are now a thing of the past, thanks to a China-funded 200-borehole drilling project mostly focused on addressing water scarcity in the province. The drilling project, contracted by construction and engineering giant China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC), has been tested and commissioned following its recent completion, benefiting 110,000 people.  Residents in several districts in the province said in separate interviews with Xinhua that potable water needs are no longer a problem in their localities.  Residents in the above-mentioned Rwinkwavu area in Kayonza district, Eastern Province, now have access to a solar-powered borehole, which provides clean and safe water.  At GS Rwinkwavu school, also one of the beneficiaries, administrators said the newly installed borehole will help them achieve their education goals.  "This project came at the right time to address a serious water problem. Besides being free, the water flows easily unlike the hand borehole. It has helped students as well as teachers and neighbors. We are excited about it," said Magnifique Habimana, the head teacher of GS Rwinkwavu.  He recalled that bathing, washing clothes and general hygiene maintenance were challenging at school before the solar-driven borehole was drilled.  "It was a very big inconvenience to the school in terms of sanitation and running costs," said Habimana. "Our only option was to hire people to fetch water for cooking and drinking. But this was not sustainable, it was a costly option."  The school's sanitation and hygiene standards have now improved with the new water source, which has a designed capacity of serving 600 people, said Habimana. "We thank the Chinese government for maintaining cooperation with Rwanda which enabled the implementation of this water project. With this water, we can do farming activities for all seasons because we have water to irrigate the crops."  Prosper Manikuze, the standards and quality control specialist in Rwanda's Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC), who has closely followed the project, said the contractors have delivered quality work.  "I appreciate the quality of this project because the contractors took an initiative to install standard borehole handles and heads. The mixing of cement ratio was also good for concrete works. It was built with strong materials," he said.  Manikuze said GS Rwinkwavu previously had no water as a manual borehole in place was not functional, but even though it was working it would not satisfy the high water demand. "With the solar-powered borehole facility at the school, there will be no students missing school anymore to go and fetch water which we hope will boost education standards," he said.  Clarisse Uwera, a resident of Murambi in Gatsibo district, also in East Province, said getting water for drinking, cooking and washing clothes at her home has been eased. "Before it was a challenge. The newly installed water source benefits many people, about 300 people in this village. I'm very thankful to have access to this borehole. There is no need to worry anymore about water."  Jean Damascene Harelimana, the vice mayor of Kayonza district in charge of social affairs, said the newly installed boreholes will positively impact the health and wellbeing of many people.  "We are all happy about the water project. We are also happy about the cooperation of Rwanda and China which leads to an extension of services to people," he said.  Lack of access to clean water increases the risk of outbreaks of waterborne disease, including acute watery diarrhea and diseases such as cholera.  Diarrheal disease, often caused by bacteria ingested through contaminated food or water, is the second leading cause of death in children under five, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Chen Jinke, the manager of the Chinese borehole drilling project, said the boreholes are well protected and the impact is good.  The wells are installed with chlorination systems to keep the water clean and ready to drink, and solar wells are built in places with a high concentration of people such as markets and schools, according to Chen.  "The boreholes using solar energy are good since Rwanda has good sunshine intensity which can meet the conditions of using solar wells. Compared with the manual system, the solar borehole can ensure reliable water supply to the surrounding villages," he explained.

The Municipality Center organized the screening at the parking lot of the Kosevo football stadium as a part of its annual Days of Youth celebration, which traditionally lasts from May 2 to 9.  The movie narrative follows Vladimir Peric Valter, a World War II iconic member of the anti-fascist resistance movement, taking on Nazi occupation forces in Sarajevo.  First screened in April 1972, the movie has become one of the most watched movies in history, and has been screened in more than 40 countries across the world including China, where it was very popular in the 1970s.  Given the international popularity of the movie, Sarajevo dedicated a small museum to it. The museum was opened in April 2019, and has since become an important sight for Chinese tourists.

The nearly 300-million-yuan revenue, though much lower than the 1.67 billion yuan generated during the holiday last year, is "no easy feat," according to experts reached by Xinhua.  It is meaningful considering that the current wave of COVID-19 infections has caused the postponement of release dates by multiple major domestic titles and mounting cinema closures, especially in Shanghai and Beijing -- two box office powerhouses.  The achievement somehow signals hope for further film market recovery and serves as a warm-up for the summer movie season, usually a busy moviegoing period, they said.  "BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED"  China's box office performance during the holiday has been regarded as "better than expected" by a China Film News report quoting industry insiders.  Daily ticket sales peaked at 81 million yuan on May 1, a huge jump from a low of less than 10 million yuan that continued for many working days in April, according to box office tracker Maoyan and the China Movie Data Information Network.  Nearly 8.7 million people went to movie theaters during the holiday when a daily average of around 68 percent of cinemas remained open nationwide, up from 56 percent on April 28.  Topping the sales chart was the romantic comedy "Stay With Me" from Enlight Pictures with 88 million yuan, immediately followed by DreamWorks Animation's animated comedy "The Bad Guys" with 71.55 million yuan.  Coming in third place was Warner Bros. Pictures' "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore." It grossed nearly 33 million yuan during the holiday.  Rao Shuguang, president of the China Film Critics Association, said in the May Day holiday box office figures people can see "hope and vitality" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  "The 'fundamentals' of China's film market are still there, holding on and waiting (for the pandemic to wane)," commented the critic. He said some of the cinemas are struggling to survive the impact of the pandemic and they need support.  WARM-UP FOR SUMMER MOVIE SEASON  China's summer movie season spanning three months until Aug. 31 is usually a busy moviegoing period for young people.  It generated an average of 17 billion yuan in box office revenue in each of the three years through 2019, before the pandemic struck.  The amount for the same period dropped to just 7.4 billion yuan in 2021, even lower than the 7.8 billion yuan recorded for the same year's seven-day Spring Festival holiday.  As the output imbalance among different movie seasons is becoming an outstanding issue, experts are calling for greater efforts to meet young moviegoers' need for quality films and boost summer box office sales.  Rao called the upcoming summer movie season "a big test" for China's film market, stressing the need to increase the market supply of high-quality, major films to solidify and explore the moviegoer base that is being diverted online partly due to the COVID-19.  His remarks echoed surging worries among cinema chain managers that young people are increasingly accustomed to going online for films and dramas, rather than attending theaters.  Confident about film's status as an industry, Yin Hong, vice chairman of the China Film Association and a professor at Tsinghua University, said as long as there are great movies and demands for them still exist, a fully-recovered film industry will be foreseeable.  Comparing cinemas to "the first window to showcase a film's influence, popularity, and appeal," Yin said only when cinemas flourish can films flourish on streaming platforms.  "Without the support of cinemas, it's almost impossible for a movie to become a huge hit that is widely known among the public," he said.  That said, Yin stressed that an orderly film market, wider range of film themes, more diverse film genres, professional talent, and the promotion of shared values are crucial to the Chinese movie industry's high-quality development.

(Photo courtesy of Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Gaoping Municipal Committee)  The 7th cross-Strait ceremony to worship Emperor Yan, a legendary ancestor of the Chinese nation, will take place on May 8 in Gaoping, a county-level city in north China’s Shanxi Province, where the mausoleum of Emperor Yan is located, its organizers revealed at a recent press conference.  Gaoping, administered by Jincheng city, is best known for its unique culture of Emperor Yan. Since 2016, Gaoping has hosted six cross-Strait ceremonies to worship Emperor Yan, providing excellent opportunities for people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to strengthen and celebrate ties of kinship and culture.  At the press conference, Wu Jianpeng, deputy mayor of Jincheng, called on people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese diaspora to pay homage to Emperor Yan, and pray for blessings.  Yuan Jian, mayor of Gaoping, announced the 7th cross-Strait ceremony at the press conference while inviting members of the Chinese diaspora and friends from all over the globe to visit and invest in the city.  The event will be held both online and offline after implementing COVID-19 prevention and control measures.  The event will feature a wide range of activities, including soliciting 100 stories about Emperor Yan from around the world, to promote the history and culture of Emperor Yan, and the cultural heritage of Gaoping and Jincheng.

As the name indicates, this solar term indicates the arrival of summer. The term came into being near the end of the Warring States Period (475-221BC).  From the Start of Summer, the days lengthen, temperatures rise and rainfall increases.   &nbsp;   Traditions:  Weighing:  People believe that weighing themselves can ease the heat of summer, keep people healthy and bring good luck to children. As a result, the saying goes that on the Start of Summer you'd better weigh yourself to avoid bad luck.  Egg competition:  On the Start of Summer, parents put eggs into handmade colorful net bags. Children wear the bag around their necks and take part in a game with their friends. Both competitors try to hit the other person's egg, like conkers, and the egg that stays intact wins. The process continues until the only one left whole becomes the "king of eggs" while children who lose eat their eggs. It's believed that by eating eggs, children can enjoy an untroubled summer.  Food and drinks:  Taste fresh food on the Start of Summer:  In the southern part of the Yangtze River, it is said that three kinds of fresh food are to be eaten. Traditionally, these are cherry, plum and Reeves' shad. There are other variations of this rule: bamboo shoots, cherry and plum; cherry, plum and wheat berry; and bamboo shoot, cherry and broad beans. The gist of the different categories is that people should enjoy fresh food during this solar term.  In Jiangxi, people drink tea during the Start of Summer. Green tea is one of their favorites because it dispels heat.&nbsp;  Start of Summer Rice:  It is popular in Guangxi to cook five different beans with rice. The beans are red, yellow, black and green while the rice is white. Thus, Start of Summer rice is also called Five-Colored Rice.  During the Start of Summer, it is essential to maintain a light diet. Vegetables and fruits are good choices while spicy and salty food should be avoided. People should remain calm and enjoy a variety of activities like painting, fishing and playing chess.

This year also marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC).  * Nowadays, young Chinese identify more and more with the splendors of Chinese civilization. They are deeply proud of the Chinese nation, and are more active in promoting traditional Chinese culture and boosting cultural confidence across society.  * China has pledged to go all out to preserve and develop its excellent traditional culture, eyeing a "marked boost" in the international influence of Chinese culture by 2025.  TAIYUAN/LHASA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Sitting in a self-designed, ancient-style courtyard, Liu Kai, 30, draws Chongfu Temple, a cultural structure steeped in history and now under state protection in north China's Shanxi Province.  Hailing from a farming family in Zhuge Village, Shanxi's Linfen City, Liu has a passion for ancient China's awe-inspiring architecture, especially the buildings in the culture-rich province.  Over the past eight years, he has recorded over 50 historic structures on paper, depicting himself in front of each old building. "It is me, like countless others who have looked up to the heritage through the ages," Liu said.  On April 21, China released its first white paper centered on its youth, "Youth of China in the New Era." This year also marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC).  China's youth draw nutrients from the best of China's traditional culture, revolutionary culture, and advanced socialist culture, and gain strength from the time-honored Chinese civilization, said the document.  Young Chinese identify more and more with the splendors of Chinese civilization. They are deeply proud of the Chinese nation, and are more active in promoting traditional Chinese culture and boosting cultural confidence across society, according to the white paper.    File photo provided by Liu Kai shows a painting of his depicting a view of the Tayuan Temple on Mount Wutai in north China's Shanxi Province. (Xinhua)  Over the years, China has placed great emphasis on the passing on and promotion of its culture, with a raft of guidelines and proposals launched to fuel the nationwide protection, innovation and spread of its invaluable culture.  Liu is not alone in his passion for China's past. After posting his paintings online, his artworks have wowed netizens and attracted collectors across the country.  China has pledged to go all out to preserve and develop its excellent traditional culture, eyeing a "marked boost" in the international influence of Chinese culture by 2025.  According to the guidelines issued by the central government in 2017, major achievements are expected to be registered in traditional culture-related research, education, protection, inheritance, innovation and exchanges by 2025.  China's top design to rejuvenate its fine culture has received an enthusiastic echo from the public.  At a Virtual Reality (VR) exhibition hall in Xigaze City, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, an eight-minute video introduces visitors to the history and development of Zhentang Sherpa dance, a form of national intangible cultural heritage.  The videography and translation involved the efforts of 23-year-old Sidar, who is of Sherpa descent. His hometown Zhentang, deep in the Himalayas and bordering Nepal, is home to more than 2,600 Sherpa people.  The young man's mother is a practitioner of Zhentang Sherpa dance. When Sidar was a child, he used to watch his mother teach locals of all ages the ancient steps of the dance.    File photo taken by Sidar shows Sherpa villagers enjoying liquor made from Eleusine Coracana in Zhentang of Xigaze, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, on July 16, 2019. (Photo by Sidar/Xinhua)  Scholars have frequently visited the sleepy town to conduct studies of the unique local culture. "The Sherpa culture is diverse and rich. Scholars make academic achievements, but the responsibility of real cultural inheritance falls on the shoulders of local youths like Sidar," said Tarring Namgel, an associate professor at the College of Art of Tibet University. He traveled to the region to research Mani Drama, another time-honored form of Sherpa cultural heritage.  Increasing participation in such trips inspired Sidar to record local culture through his lens. Old gadgets of the Sherpa people, dancing and vibrant festival celebrations have since become the subjects of his videos.  "Our culture is like an ancient river that flows inside us from history to today," Sidar said. It is his dream to make a documentary and establish a museum of Sherpa folk culture.  More and more young Chinese people have joined efforts to preserve cultural heritage thanks to China's blockbuster documentaries and television shows such as "Masters in the Forbidden City" and "National Treasure."  When Zhu Xiaocong, now an ancient calligraphy and painting conservator, landed his job at Shanxi Museum seven years ago, he only had three or four colleagues. But now, the team has expanded to about 30 people, with its members mostly born after 1990.  Zhu's studio may seem like a kitchen to the untrained eye, as a variety of brushes hang on the walls, knives rest in drawers and pots of different sizes litter the counter. Lying on his workbench is a piece of calligraphy dating back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), spoiled by faint stains and cracks.    Zhu Xiaocong, a restorer for painting and calligraphy, works on an artwork at the Shanxi Museum in Taiyuan, north China's Shanxi Province, April 27, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Xuetao)  Zhu is "performing surgery" on the delicate artwork. He scrapes off the stains with a knife and sticks thin white strips to the back of the paper on damaged areas.  "It can take days to merely open the frames of articrafts using tweezers, as ancient Chinese people used to write and draw on fragile materials," Zhu explained.  "Young people are energetic, but they can lack experience when it comes to artifact restoration," said Guo Zhiyong, deputy director of the museum's cultural artifact conservation and research department. "However, their techniques can be greatly improved through training, teaching guides from their seniors, and field trips."  Over the past seven years, Zhu has single-handedly restored over 100 ancient paintings and calligraphy works. "All my efforts are worthwhile when I see the artifacts restored to their former glory and appreciated by museum visitors," he said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The combined operating revenues of major companies in the sector amounted to about 2.7 trillion yuan (about 408 billion U.S. dollars) during the period, up 5 percent year on year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).  Among the sub-sectors, the revenue of cultural content creation logged a year-on-year growth of 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the data showed.  The country's central region led the growth with the revenue of the sector expanding 12 percent year on year, followed by the eastern and western regions.  The NBS data came from a survey of cultural companies with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan or those meeting other standards set by the NBS.

Phoenix Collective performs at Sydney Mosman Art Gallery on April 23, 2022. (Photo /Jiayi Wang)  This was the first time that Phoenix Collective combined Western string quartets with the traditional Chinese erhu. It revealed the unique charm of Chinese and Western music fusion by exploring traditional Chinese folk music, winning wide praise from audiences.  Chinese erhu performer Ying Liu and four famous Australian performers from the Phoenix Collective performed the concert together and jointly arranged Chinese and Australian classical music works.  Dan Russell, artistic director of the concert, said that the concept of combining Western string quartets and erhu was formed by exchanging musical ideas with Ying and the orchestra's cellist Andrew Wilson. “The uniqueness of the erhu sound, for me, represents the different soundscape that I was looking for,” he said.    Performers' group photo (Photo/Jiayi Wang)  &nbsp;He also said that although the ensemble of violin and erhu put forward higher requirements for the selection of repertoire, the erhu and string quartet cooperated perfectly.  Ying also agreed. “The sound of the violin and the erhu are very well integrated.  &nbsp;“Now many composers have begun to compose music focusing on the fusion of Chinese and Western music.”  &nbsp;Liu also affirmed the significance of this tour concert. She said, “Chinese culture has been subtly integrated into Western artistic creation.”  &nbsp;Russell also added that films with traditional Chinese culture also inspired him.&nbsp;    Dan Russell, the artistic director of the concert (Photo/Xueyi Zhao)  “I've kind of grown up listening to the music used in movies such as&nbsp;Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,&nbsp;and&nbsp;House of Flying Daggers, the music used in these movies is exquisite,” Russell said.  The whole concert mainly explored traditional Chinese folk music, improvisation and modern experimental techniques. The concert opened with an excerpt from the classic Chinese music piece&nbsp;Ode to Yellow River&nbsp;by cellist Andrew Wilson.  The repertoire also includes many classic pieces adapted from the fusion of Chinese and Western musical elements, such as&nbsp;Left Bank Waltz&nbsp;by Australian composer Peter Schuthorpe, specially arranged by Australian arranger Julie Symonds for the erhu and quartet.  The adapted Chinese traditional folk songs&nbsp;Jasmine Flower,&nbsp;Beautiful Night,&nbsp;Lan Hua-Hua, and other works were also performed for audience, one after another. More improvised songs, such as the music from Oscar-winning film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, attracted applause from the audience.    Chinese erhu performer Ying Liu (Photo/Xueyi Zhao)  The Australian audience also showed great enthusiasm for the concert.  Russell said that music is a sound that anyone can understand.  “Music is a universal language, and so in that respect, anyone can enjoy and understand it,” he noted  Ying also said that most people listening to the concert were Westerners. "Everyone likes and enjoys it, and completely indulges in it," she said.  Ying also emphasized that the exchange of music between China and the West shows China's national culture and self-confidence, and music is the commonwealth of all humanity.

Tucked away in the boundless lush mountains in south China, the cottages feature walls made of wood or mud, and triangular thatch roofs, giving them the appearance of an overturned boat.  The boat-shaped houses were built by the local ethnic Li people in Chubao Village. For thousands of years, the local Li people have lived in these houses in the rainforest.  "We lived here for generations," said local villager Wang Shiqi.  In recent years, locals have gradually moved into modern new houses. But as the traditional dwellings bear testimony to the Li culture, they are now well preserved.  Authorities are applying for the houses to be included in the World Heritage List, hoping to draw more attention to the distinctive values of the Li culture.  Recently, the Hainan tropical rainforest and the traditional settlement of Li ethnic group have become part of the tentative list to qualify for inclusion in the World Heritage List.  The Li people have developed a distinctive culture over many years of development. Their colorful culture includes Li brocade, bamboo dancing, face tattoos, and boat-shaped houses, among others.  Legend has it that the ancestors of the Li people arrived in Hainan by boats. When they arrived, they turned the boats upside down as houses for shelter. Their descendants built the boat-shaped houses in memory of their ancestors.  In the late 1980s, about 800,000 Li people were still living in boat-shaped dwellings in Hainan.  But the houses were not that easy to live in, as they were made of thatch or mud, making them susceptible to the damage from wind and rain.  "In the summertime, it was cool in the houses, but in winter, the biting wind sneaked in through the cracks," recalled Wang Shiqi.  As people's living conditions improved, they began to move out of the houses.  Though villagers no longer live in the houses, they have unique feelings attached to them.  "After all, we have lived here for a long time," Wang said.  Authorities have made efforts to preserve the traditional houses by putting them on the provincial-level list of cultural heritage under protection.  "The thatched houses reflected the Li people's wisdom for house location and layout and their architecture skills," said Li Jilong, with the provincial department of tourism, culture, radio, television and sports.  The houses should be preserved as cultural relics so that the younger generation will know the stories of their ancestors, said Chen Rongchuan, curator of the cultural museum in the city of Dongfang, which administers Baicha Village, home to more than 80 such houses.  "The traditional houses are of great value, and they should be well preserved," said Liu Baodang, with the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Luo Xin)  BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Zhiwu, a 70-year-old from central China's Hubei Province, has downloaded some 600 digital books on a reading App on his tablet computer.  "I've found so much joy in reading or listening to digital books as a way to keep up with the times and enrich my golden years," said Chen, adding that he spends some four to five hours a day on the reading App.  The first National Conference on Reading concluded in Beijing on Monday with digital reading taking the spotlight. With advances in technology and the popularization of the mobile internet, digital reading has become a new driving force to encourage people of all ages in China to read.  According to the China digital readership report 2021 released during the conference, the number of digital book readers in China reached 506 million in 2021, up 2.43 percent year on year.  The overall scale of China's digital reading market reached 41.57 billion yuan (about 6.3 billion U.S. dollars) last year, marking a year-on-year growth of 18.23 percent, according to the report mainly compiled by the China Audio-video and Digital Publishing Association.  As a growing trend, audio reading attracted over 800 million active users in China last year, an increase of 230 million over 2020, said Fan Weiping, president of the China Federation of Radio and Television Associations.  Noticeably, audio reading functions as a bridge over the "digital gap" for elderly readers like Cheng, and a number of e-book platforms have focused on optimizing the audio reading experience.  "We provide personalized book lists for aged members, and the AI technologies we utilize can convert text into audio content in real-time without the need for human voice recording," said Liu Xin, general manager of Migu Culture Technology Co., Ltd while introducing a tailored version of their reading App for elderly.  Industry insiders pointed out that audio reading products, such as audiovisual novels, interactive picture books, and short dramas, have become an important resource for cultural IP development and formed a mature IP incubation system.  Meanwhile, young people still dominate China's digital reading market. Over 70 percent of digital book readers were under the age of 25 in 2021, the aforementioned report shows.  Digital reading has also helped with the popularization of classic books among the young. Cheng Wu, CEO of China Literature, said that last year, the Analects of Confucius was the most popular e-book on its platform with nearly 30 million views, and more than 80 percent of its readers were under 30 years old.  China's digital reading products, especially online literature, have become more and more popular in overseas markets. Over 400,000 Chinese digital books were released abroad last year, with fantasy and martial arts among the most popular themes, according to the industry report.  "In the future, the digital reading experience will be further transformed," said Liu with Migu. "A book will no longer be just a book. It will be a constant flow of thinking, writing, sharing, socializing, marketing, and other activities."

"Ren" stands for people's hearts as well as talents. The saying, which comes from Shiji, or Records of the Grand Historian, a monumental history book of ancient China compiled about 2,000 years ago, has two connotations.  Only by winning people's hearts and responding to their wishes can a country or government continue to thrive. This is in accord with the philosophy that "people's will is the foundation of the state" and "people are the foundation of the state."  Moreover, talents are critical to the rise and fall of a country or government. Only by identifying and recruiting the most capable and upright people and suitably employing them can a great cause be completed and a country and its government remain stable and secure.  Winning people's hearts is closely related to attracting the talented. Winning people's hearts will eventually draw in the talented, and recruiting the talented will eventually help win people's hearts.  Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China adopts a people-centered development philosophy. This is best illustrated by China's massive poverty-alleviation campaign and its handling of the COVID-19 epidemic, where such concepts and practices as "no one should be left behind" and "people first, life first" have been demonstrated.  China emphasizes the development of professional talent to improve the country's workforce, and education to nurture a new generation of capable young people who are well-prepared to join the socialist cause.

A visitor watches a video featuring Huizhou Opera in a museum in east China’s Anhui Province. (Photo/Shi Yalei)  “I have performed Huangmei Opera for 30 years. But I never expected that I would attract so many new fans through live-streaming shows,” said Liu Lihua, head of the Huangmei Opera troupe in Huaining county, Anqing city, east China’s Anhui Province.  Liu said that the troupe has moved its performances online in recent two years due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 epidemic and has held live-streaming sessions on Douyin, a popular short-video sharing platform in China. To her surprise, the troupe’s live-streaming account on the platform garnered 600,000 followers and 3 million likes in just three months.  The popularity of Huangmei Opera on the platform epitomizes the appeal of traditional Chinese opera to an increasing number of people.  Statistics showed that by February of this year, performances of over 300 Chinese opera types had been presented on Douyin, 231 types of which had also been performed through live-streaming sessions. Last year, over 800,000 live-streaming shows on Chinese operas were held on the platform, with each attracting an average of more than 3,200 viewers. The top five most popular operas on Douyin were Peking Opera, Qinqiang Opera, Yue Opera, Huangmei Opera, and Henan Yu Opera.  “Online platforms offer viewers easy access to traditional Chinese operas,” said Wan Quan, a fan of Peking Opera who was born in the 1990s.    Performers stage a Pingju Opera show in Fengrun district, Tangshan city, north China’s Hebei Province. (Photo/Zhu Dayong)  The biggest perk of watching online videos featuring Peking Opera is that young fans can acquire knowledge of the art, something which is necessary to truly appreciate the art form, through comments from other internet users, according to Wan.  He explained that when viewers find resonance with operas through online interaction, they will be more willing to continue to learn about opera and enjoy opera performances offline.  Meanwhile, internet platforms have also helped popularize some art forms featuring opera elements.  On China’s popular video-streaming platform Bilibili, Bian Jingting, a vlogger who graduated from the Shanghai Theatre Academy, has garnered about 800,000 followers by uploading videos featuring herself performing Chinese “gufeng” songs in a Peking Opera style. “Gufeng” music is a particular type of music with lyrical, musical, and symbolic references to ancient China that is often produced, consumed, and circulated within online fan communities.  Many viewers commented that they went on to learn more about traditional operas after watching her videos.  Now Bian introduces shows of traditional Chinese operas and related knowledge to her audiences during live-streaming sessions, popularizing Chinese opera culture.  “The reason why songs featuring elements of traditional Chinese operas have become popular among young people, is that young creators are more familiar with new media and make innovations by blending elements of traditional Chinese operas into songs,” said Lin Ling, an associate researcher with the China Institute of Fudan University.  Lin pointed out to better inherit traditional Chinese operas, the industry will continue to attract more audiences and continue to make these operas fun through innovations.

Steele, who also has a Chinese name, Hailin Wen, has been a tour guide in Sydney for many years now. The Australian man, who speaks fluent Chinese, has a great passion for Chinese culture and offers guide services for tourists in Mandarin Chinese. Through the years, he has helped many Chinese visitors to enjoy a wonderful journey in Sydney, Australia, by offering his Mandarin-speaking tours.  “There are a lot of people in Sydney and in Australia with a Chinese background, and I think those people are really important in building relationships. So this Chinatown tour that I’ve launched is focused on telling the story of Chinese-Australians and to celebrate the contributions that the Chinese people have made to Australia over the last 200 years,” said Steele.&nbsp;  Steele used to work as a corporate lawyer until one day he finally decided to quit his job and pursue a happier career as a tour guide and travel consultant. He noted that the most exciting thing about this job is to show people different places and bring people together to experience historical stories.  In 2018, Steele founded AussieYou Travel (now called Local Sauce), a travel agency that offers small group tour services for tourists worldwide. Its Walking Sydney's Chinatown tour has been among the most popular options for Chinese tourists. This tour was designed to give visitors a chance to learn more about the Chinese communities residing in Australia. During the two-hour tour, Steele usually takes the visitors to Chinatown, tasting authentic Chinese snacks and exploring the early history and development of the community.  “When people talk about Chinese food, they may only know Sichuan, Shanghai and Cantonese cuisine, but they don't know what Rou Jia Mo and lamb kebabs are, so I want more people to taste special snacks from different parts of China,” said the man.  Actually, Steele personally knows many of the Chinese restaurant owners there. He would always give them a warm hello every time he passes by. “These restaurants have lost so much business over the past two years because of COVID. So I want to help them in this way,” he said.  Other than Chinese cuisine, Steele also takes the time to introduce the history behind some of the different Chinese communities in Australia. He takes the visitors to places such as the&nbsp;Australian Chinese&nbsp;Ex-Services&nbsp;Monument and the Golden Water Mouth Tree, a feng shui-stylized treasure tree covered in 23-karat gold leaf at the entranceway to the local Chinatown.&nbsp;  To encourage the tourists to learn more about how the local Chinese community has contributed to the development of Sydney, Steele even designed an educational game, where participants are divided into different teams and then compete to find nine Chinese-Australians and list their contributions to society.&nbsp;  Steele’s interest in China began all the way back when he was in primary school. At that time, he was living with his family whose home was located in the Chinese community of Brisbane. With the influence of many Chinese and Asian classmates, he chose Chinese as a second language to study as a young pupil. This learning experience then accompanied him through his high school and university years.&nbsp;  “China has been a big part of my life and I made many Chinese friends both in Australia and China,” he said.  At the age of 16, Steele went to Guilin for an exchange study trip where he received a Chinese name from his host family. During this exchange trip, he visited Shanghai, Beijing, and many other places in China. After graduating from high school, the young man went on to study at Nanjing University, where he spent a great deal of vocational time traveling everywhere around the country as a student. No matter where he went, he would always do his best to taste the local food and learn about local culture, “this is the best way to understand the diversity of China.”  Nowadays, Chinese tourists have become an important group for Steele’s business in Australia. More than 50 percent of his clients are Chinese, having seen overall a 40 percent increase in his total number of clients from 2018 to 2019. This number was expected to double by 2020, but the business was met with its most severe challenge to date over the last two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;  Even so, Steele remains optimistic about his career. He never regretted entering into the tourism industry. He is also really looking forward to welcoming more tourists to Australia after the pandemic is over. “I hope my little tours can play a part to help in improving relations and improving people’s knowledge in recognition of the importance of the China-Australia relationship through tourism,” he said.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

The Angkor Archaeological Park, inscribed on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1992, is the most popular tourist destination in the Southeast Asian nation.  Covering an area of 401-square kilometers, the Angkor site contains the magnificent remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire from the ninth to the 15th century, and it consists of scores of key temples such as the Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, Chau Say Tevoda and Ta Keo, among others.  Long Kosal, deputy director-general and spokesman for the Apsara National Authority, which is the government agency responsible for managing, safeguarding and preserving the site, said China has helped restore ruined temples there since 1997, restoring the Chau Say Tevoda temple and the Ta Keo temple successfully.  He said the restoration work on the Chau Say Tevoda was completed in 2008 and on the Ta Keo, which started in late 2010, was concluded in 2018.  "And since 2019, the Chinese experts have begun working on the 11-year restoration project of the Phimeanakas temple located inside the walled enclosure of the Royal Palace of the Angkor Thom," he told Xinhua.  Built in the middle of the 10th century, the Phimeanakas temple was considered a place of worship in the Royal Palace, which covered an area of 581 meters long and 242 meters wide.  Kosal said that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the restoration work is still going on smoothly.  "We highly value China's active contribution to the protection, preservation and development of the Angkor," he said. "China's assistance has not only contributed to ensuring the sustainable development of our cultural heritage, but also helped train Cambodian experts on restoration and preservation work."  Meanwhile, Kosal said that during the pandemic when few tourists visited the site, the Apsara National Authority had taken the opportunity to do renovation work, maintenance and gardening at the site in order to improve its beauty.  "Now, the Angkor Archaeological Park is ready to welcome all tourists from around the world," he said. "As our country has reopened its borders to fully vaccinated travelers without quarantine, I believe that more international tourists will spend their holidays visiting the Angkor in the near future."  Prior to the pandemic, the Angkor attracted up to 2.2 million international visitors in 2019, earning 99 million U.S. dollars in revenue from ticket sales.  Tourism ministry's secretary of state and spokesman Top Sopheak said the number of foreign tourists to the Angkor has gradually recovered in the first quarter of 2022, adding that it received 19,840 foreign tourists during the January-March period this year, up 342 percent from 4,482 over the same period last year.  "Now, the Angkor attracts about 400 foreign tourists a day, a gradual increase from only 70 per day during the pandemic in the past two years," he told Xinhua.  Sopheak recalled that prior to the pandemic, the site received up to 9,000 international visitors a day.  Chhay Sivlin, president of the Cambodia Association of Travel Agents, said some tour and travel operators have restarted their businesses after the country has fully resumed its socioeconomic activities and reopened its borders to vaccinated travelers without quarantine, buoyed by high vaccination rates.  "We hope that international visitors will gradually return to Cambodia, especially to the Angkor, because several flights between Cambodia and other countries have been resumed," she said.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

After making its debut at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing in August 2021, the show went on a nationwide tour, performing in 16 cities across the country, totaling 50 performances, winning wide praise from audiences.  According to the Poly Theater in Beijing, tickets for the dance show sold out instantly after being available for reservations, with the theatre eventually adding three more shows in order to meet audiences’ needs.

The show broke the record for most consecutive performances of a Chinese dance show in one city.  Cultural and creative products related to the dance show, such as masks, thermals, post cards, notebooks, hair bands and bags, were popular purchases for audience members while waiting for the performances to begin at the Poly Theater in Beijing.  Jing Xiaoyong, head of the China Oriental Performing Arts Group, stated that the dance show has eyed diverse and mature partnerships with cultural and creative brands. “This fully proves that dance shows have been integrated into daily life, and their influence can be found in every aspect of society,” Jing said.&nbsp;    A stage photo of the dance show “Poetic Dance: The Journey of a Legendary Landscape Painting.” (Photo courtesy of the China Oriental Performing Arts Group)    A stage photo of the dance show “Poetic Dance: The Journey of a Legendary Landscape Painting.” (Photo courtesy of the China Oriental Performing Arts Group) Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

The formation, which is on a "cross-sea area" training exercise, involved J-15 fighter jets, as well as several ship-borne helicopters. Photo: Navy.81.cn  Starting a routine, realistic combat training mission in the West Pacific about a week ago, the Liaoningaircraft carrier group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has reportedly been practicing intensively over the past few days in the Philippine Sea to the east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan, a location that experts said is a vital place to stop potential external interference in event of a reunification-by-force operation in the Taiwan Straits.  With the carrier group to Taiwan's east, the PLA also reportedly dispatched an increased number of different types of warplanes and additional warships from the Chinese mainland west of the island of Taiwan, effectively surrounding and enclosing the island under the watch of US and Japanese aircraft carriers, which are serving as "perfect practice partners" for the PLA drills, analysts said.  After reporting a PLA Navy flotilla, consisting of the aircraft carrier Liaoning, a Type 055 large destroyer, three Type 052D destroyers, a Type 052C destroyer, a Type 054A frigate and a Type 901 comprehensive supply ship, sailed from the East China Sea through the Miyako Strait to the Pacific Ocean on May 2, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff released monitoring reports for five consecutive days from Wednesday to Sunday. It said the carrier group conducted intensive, cross-day-and-night carrier-based aircraft training with live munitions in the Philippine Sea east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan from Tuesday to Saturday.  The Liaoningcarrier group was sailing slowly closer to the island of Taiwan as its drills went on, the Japanese releases show.  The Philippine Sea where the Liaoningcarrier group is holding drills is a vital sea region should a reunification-by-force operation take place, Shi Hong, executive chief editor of Chinese mainland magazine Shipborne Weapons, told the Global Times on Sunday.  By moving in tandem with aerial and maritime forces from the Chinese mainland, the carrier group could completely cut off the routes foreign forces may take if they militarily interfere with the Taiwan question, and this will bring significant advantages to the PLA, Shi said.  Just as the Liaoningcarrier group was practicing to the east of Taiwan, Taiwan's defense authority reported significant increases of PLA warplane activities to the island's southwest and southeast in terms of both aircraft types and sortie numbers from Thursday to Sunday.  A total of 31 PLA aircraft sorties featuring H-6 bombers, J-11 and J-16 fighter jets, KJ-500 early warning aircraft, Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft and electronic warfare aircraft, as well as Ka-28 anti-submarine warfare helicopters were spotted by Taiwan's defense authority during those days.  Since the Ka-28 is a vessel-based helicopter, it is almost certain that there were PLA warships sailing to the west of the island of Taiwan in addition to the Liaoningcarrier group in the east, observers said.  By featuring many powerful vessels, the Liaoningcarrier group is already mighty by itself. It is possible that the carrier group and the forces from the mainland were having a joint exercise, testing different combinations of forces, practicing and enhancing all kinds of tactics, Shi said.  PLA aircraft and vessels are not alone in the Philippine Sea, as Japanese and US forces are also present in the region.  Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said that the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force dispatched the Izumo, a de facto aircraft carrier, to monitor the PLA carrier group. According to the Fleet and Marine Tracker by the news website of the US Naval Institute, US Navy's Abraham Lincolncarrier strike group was also operating in the Philippine Sea at least as of May 2.  They are the most realistic practice partners for the PLA, because they could be the real opponents the PLA one day might have to face in the region, Shi said, noting that their presence could serve as excellent grindstones that can help enhance the combat capabilities of the Liaoningcarrier group.  While Senior Captain Gao Xiucheng, a spokesperson of the PLA Navy, said on Tuesday that the Liaoningcarrier group's drills are not targeted at another party, it is always one of the PLA's greatest goals to liberate Taiwan and achieve national reunification, and all secessionists and external interferences are by default potential targets of the PLA, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times, requesting anonymity.  With some of the most influential Japanese politicians making wrong remarks on the Taiwan question recently, claiming that "Taiwan's concerns are Japan's concerns," and that "Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow," and with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi only "postponing" her visit to Taiwan after her alleged COVID-19 infection, it is important that the PLA releases a powerful deterrent with the drills and pragmatically enhances its combat capabilities, the expert said.

(JINI via Xinhua)  JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israelis joined a slew of national celebrations to mark the country's 74th Independence Day.  This year's Independent Day began on Wednesday evening and will last till Thursday evening.  A ceremony was held at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl, Israel's national cemetery, on Wednesday evening, during which, Mickey Levy, the country's parliament speaker, delivered a keynote speech and called for national unity.  "I believe that we can succeed every day to choose to see the good in each other... to choose togetherness over divisions, to coexist," he said.  On Thursday morning, official celebrations started at President Isaac Herzog's official residence in Jerusalem, with the delivery of citations for the distinguished service of soldiers.  As singers and artists performed on stages across the country all through the night, hundreds of thousands of Israelis celebrated the national festival on the beaches or parks, waving flags and making barbecues.  Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948, though it marks Independence Day on different dates every year based on the Hebrew calendar.  In the Hebrew calendar, days begin in the evening, so Independence Day is observed from nightfall until the following evening of the designated day.  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who lived in this region, became refugees in the ensuing battles. The Palestinians who stayed became Israeli citizens and make up about 20 percent of Israel's 9.5 million population.

The allies are set to begin the two-week Korea Flying Training on Monday, May 9, the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who has vowed to bolster the Seoul-Washington security alliance under his slogan of "peace through strength."  "The two air forces plan to begin the two-week training on the same scale as the past trainings," said Yonhap, citing an anonymous source.  The ROK and the United States regularly stage military exercises, mainly in the spring and summer. However, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly expressed vehement opposition to joint drills, denouncing them as rehearsals for invasion.  The combined forces of the ROK and the U.S. kicked off preliminary military drills last month ahead of the joint springtime military exercise. Source: CGTN ]]></full-text></doc>

Regarding the development of another country as a security threat, some people in Australia have created and spread groundless fear, said Tan Kefei, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, at a regular press conference in response to recent statements from some Australian politicians.  "Their actions will not only undermine regional security and stability, but also compromise their own images as well," Tan said.  The military cooperation among the United States, Britain and Australia in highly sensitive fields such as nuclear submarines and hypersonic missiles, will aggravate confrontation and challenge peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, Tan said.  "China has serious concerns about this," he said, reiterating that the country always upholds the path of peaceful development and adopts a defense policy that is defensive in nature.

Tan Kefei, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of National Defense, made the remarks at a regular press conference in response to an inquiry related to a recent report of the U.S. defense department on "freedom of navigation."  Under the pretext of "freedom of navigation," the United States has been frequently sending military vessels and aircraft to violate other countries' sovereignty and endanger regional peace, said Tan, calling on relevant nations to jointly oppose such maritime bullying.  Noting that the so-called "freedom of navigation operations" of the United States challenges the international order based on international law, continuously threatening navigation safety and escalating regional tensions, Tan asked the United States to reflect on the number of collisions and casualties caused by such operations.  He also urged the United States to stop its so-called "freedom of navigation operations" and stop issuing such irresponsible reports.

Recently, 15 members of the 12th Chinese peacekeeping engineering contingent to South Sudan received the Sector Commander’s Commendation conferred by the Sector West Commander of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Brigadier General Measho Hagos Seyum for their outstanding achievements and great contributions in recent peacekeeping work.  For a long time, China’s Blue Helmets have built a strong defense line to safeguard peace in regions beset by conflict, demonstrating China’s sense of responsibility as a major country.  Peace is an aspiration and lofty goal shared by all mankind. UN Peacekeeping, as instrument developed for peace and began in 1948, is aimed at helping countries torn by conflict to create conditions for lasting peace, and has become an important means of safeguarding world peace and security.  Over the past more than 70 years, UN peacekeepers have made selfless devotion and sacrifices in some of the toughest and most dangerous places in the world, while Blue Helmets have become a symbol of peace and hope in war-ravaged lands and Chinese Blue Helmets have grown into a key force in the UN peacekeeping operations (UNPKOs).  In April 1990, China’s armed forces dispatched five military observers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and embarked on a new voyage as a participant in the UNPKOs. On April 16, 1992, China dispatched its first formed military unit of Blue Helmets to Cambodia for UN peacekeeping mission.  Over the past 30 years or so, China’s armed forces have contributed a growing number of peacekeepers across an expanding range of deployments. From a few military observers at the outset of its involvement, China’s armed forces are now sending both formed units and military professionals. Chinese military peacekeepers serve on the UN missions in engineer, medical, transport, helicopter, force protection and infantry units, and as staff officers, military observers and seconded officers.    All 410 members of the 19th batch of Chinese peacekeeping force to Lebanon are awarded the United Nations Peace Medal of Honor during a ceremony at the Chinese troops’ camp in Hanniyah village in southern Lebanon, June 16, 2021.  Batches of Chinese military peacekeepers have embarked on one mission after another with courage and fortitude, becoming steadfast guardians of world peace.  Since 1992, China has sent nearly 50,000 peacekeepers to 25 UNPKOs in more than 20 countries and regions, including Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Liberia, Sudan, Lebanon, Cyprus, South Sudan, Mali and the Central African Republic.  China is the second largest contributor to both peacekeeping assessment and UN membership fees, and the largest troop-contributing country (TCC) among the permanent members of the UN Security Council.  There are many touching stories about how Chinese peacekeeping forces have brought with them peace, security and the light of hope and warmth to people in war-torn areas.  Since 2013, China has dispatched nine peacekeeping units to Mali, where they carried out duties including armed patrols and armed escorts and earned the reputation of “des troupes d'élite” of Sector East of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).  Over the past 16 years since the deployment of Chinese peacekeeping troops in Lebanon, Chinese peacekeepers successfully completed tasks including engineering construction and maintenance, providing medical services and humanitarian assistance, as well as clearing mines and explosives, during which they created the record of zero casualties for such tasks.    The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) holds an emergency drill for troops in the Juba sector and the UN police officers, April 24, 2020.  The Chinese medical units in the DRC have run a twinning project in SOS Children’s Village Bukavu to offer help for 19 years. Touched by the love and care from the units, children in the village called the female members their Chinese mothers.  In UNMISS, Chinese military peacekeepers have provided agricultural techniques, farming tools and vegetable seeds to local people. They were invited by local middle schools to teach lessons on Chinese culture and language.  Chinese military peacekeepers are not only guardians of peace but also messengers of friendship.  Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, said China’s contribution to UNPKOs is “very important”.  Peace needs to be fought for and safeguarded. China is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order. And China’s armed forces will always be a force of justice safeguarding world peace.  China’s Blue Helmets have constantly injected positive energy into world peace and will continue forging ahead courageously and unswervingly to safeguard peace with a strong sense of discipline and responsibility.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

China's first domestically-made aircraft carrier Shandong (Hull 17) was officially commissioned to the PLA Navy at a military port in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, on the afternoon of December 17, 2019, making China one of the few countries in the world that have multiple carriers. Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the commissioning ceremony for the new aircraft carrier, which was named after China's eastern province of Shandong, and handed military flag to Senior Captain Lai Yijun, commander of the ship. Photo:China Military  The Shandong, China's second aircraft carrier and the first developed domestically, reportedly started its first scheduled maintenance and refurbishment that is expected to enhance the flattop's usability after more than two years of active service. The procedure could involve the painting of new non-skid coating as well as repairs and upgrades for some subsystems, and the carrier would come back stronger than ever in a few months, observers said on Sunday.  Moored in a berth at Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China's LiaoningProvince where the carrier was constructed, the Shandongwas receiving painting of new non-skid coating to its flight deck on Saturday, the 73rd founding anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, Hong Kong-based news website wenweipo.com reported on the day.  This is the first scheduled usability enhancement maintenance of the Shandongback at its shipyard since its commissioning into the PLA Navy in December 2019 in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, and the workers at the shipyard are working extra shifts for the refurbishment, according to the wenweipo.com report.  The main dock of the Dalian Shipyard has been cleared after a civilian ship left on April 13, but the Shandonghas not yet entered the dock, the report said.  On March 18, the Shandongsailed through the Taiwan Straits from south to north without aircraft on its flight deck, Reuters reported at the time, citing the island of Taiwan's defense authority and an anonymous source. Analysts said then that the carrier was likely on its way from its homeport in Sanya to its shipyard in Dalian for a regular maintenance.  In addition to refreshing the non-skid coating of the flight deck, the maintenance could also feature the refurbishment, repair and upgrade of some subsystems that tends to wear and tear, like the arresting gear, the power system, pipelines and electronics systems, a military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.  A comprehensive examination to the carrier could be carried out, and upgrades and overhaul could be made to those parts that encountered problems or can be optimized based on the experiences gained over the past two years, the expert said.  It is totally normal for aircraft carriers to conduct this kind of regular maintenance, and this procedure could take a few months, the expert said, noting that the Shandongwould become more powerful and combat-ready after the refurbishment.  A refurbishment to the Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, took about six months, from July 2018 to January 2019, also in the Dalian Shipyard, according to media reports.

The video contains rarely seen frames of the training, the interior of China’s two aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong and also details of the seamen’s work.  The trailer of the video uses a subtle metaphor that a Navy soldier tells his mother that he plans to have a third child over the phone, hinting at China’s third aircraft carrier.  Joining the Navy in 2012 and 2019, respectively, Liaoning and Shandong have completed a variety of tasks as trailblazers in Navy transformation, contributors to China’s army building and a witnesses to a stronger China. Now, they are ready to be joined by a third member.  (Compiled by Chen Rui) Source: People's Daily App ]]></full-text></doc>

In the phone talks, Wei said that China and the United States should earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state.  China hopes to establish sound and stable major-country relations with the United States, Wei said, adding that in the meantime, China will defend its national interests and dignity.  The United States should not underestimate China's determination and capability, Wei said.  The two militaries should enhance mutual trust, strengthen dialogue and exchanges, manage risks and crises, and carry out practical cooperation, so as to ensure the normal and stable development of bilateral military-to-military relations, he said.  If the Taiwan question is not handled properly, it will have a subversive effect on China-U.S. relations, Wei stressed, adding that the Chinese military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.  Austin said that the United States will strengthen military exchanges and cooperation with China in a candid and open manner, and the United States adheres to the one-China policy.  Austin said that the two sides should manage competition and risks in a responsible way and properly handle the difficulties facing the two militaries.  The two sides also exchanged views on issues such as maritime and air security and the situation in Ukraine.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The dialogue, the first since Austin became US Defense Secretary in January 2021, will hopefully provide stability to the two countries' military-to-military ties and avoid and reduce misjudgments by letting the US better understand China's bottom line and core interests at a very challenging time in the China-US relations, analysts said.  Wei said that China and the US should implement the consensus reached by the two countries' top leadersin earnest, pledge mutual respect, coexist peacefully and avoid confrontation. The US should fulfill its promise of not seeking a new Cold War with China, should not aim to change China's system, the revitalization of its alliances should not target China, that the US does not support "Taiwan independence," and that it has no intention to seek a conflict with China.  China hopes to build a sound and steady major power relationship with the US, and it will also safeguard its national interests and dignity. The US should not underestimate China's determination and capability, Wei said.  The two countries' militaries should enhance mutual trust, boost conversation and communication, manage and control risks and crises, and carry out pragmatic cooperation to ensure the normal, steady development of the two countries' military-to-military relations, Wei said.  Wei stated a solemn position over the Taiwan question, as he stressed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and this is a fact and a status quo no one can change.  It will bring a disruptive impact on China-US relations if the Taiwan question is not handled well, and the Chinese military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, Wei said.  Austin said that the US is willing to promote the implementation of the important consensus reached by the two countries' top leaders, and it will enhance exchanges and cooperation in the military field with a sincere and open attitude.  The US stays committed to the one-China policy, Austin said.  Both sides should manage and control competition and risks with responsible manners, and deal well with challenges that the military ties between the two countries are facing, the US defense secretary said.  The biggest significance of the dialogue between two countries' defense ministers is that China and the US could avoid and reduce misjudgments by better understanding each other's bottom lines and not challenge each other's core interests, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday.  China does not seek hegemony but it will not allow the US to challenge its red lines in terms of core interests, Song said.  Hopefully, the talk can provide stability for the two countries' military-to-military ties and a resumption of high-level military communications, Song said.  The defense ministers' talk came after a video call between the two countries' top leadersin March, which was deemed constructive, and teams from both countries were directed to promptly follow up and take concrete actions to put China-US relations back on the track of steady development, the Xinhua News Agency reported at the time.  China-US relations have been in a very difficult time, with all kinds of challenges stacked together, but the two countries' leaderships know they have wide and deep common interests, and those cannot be ignored because of the challenges, a Chinese expert on foreign affairs told the Global Times on Wednesday, requesting anonymity.  Wei and Austin's phone call is a chance to enable the two militaries to better understand each other's strategic intent and enhance the management of tensions in places like the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, the expert said.  China warned the US that is should not go further on the Taiwan question, not to mention supporting "Taiwan independence" forces, as this is a major question of principle that involves national sovereignty, security and development interests, Song said. China must make clear its bottom line to the US in order to safeguard peace and stability, and the Chinese mainland has the legal basis, the capability and the determination to resolve the Taiwan question, including by force, he said.  The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command on Friday organized multi-services and arms, dispatching forces including destroyers, frigates, bombers and fighters, and conducted joint combat alert patrols and drillsincluding a maritime assault, in the forefront of the East China Sea and in waters and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan, when a group of US lawmakers were visiting the island.  A total of 11 PLA aircraft, namely a Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft, two H-6 bombers, a KJ-500 early warning aircraft and seven J-16 fighter jets, entered the island of Taiwan's self-proclaimed southwestern air defense identification zone on Wednesday, Taiwan's defense authority said on the day.  Wei and Austin exchanged views over air and maritime safety issues, with China demanding the US to stop making military provocations from the sea.  China and the US have already established mechanisms for the safety of air and maritime encounters, but the US military has been increasing close-in reconnaissance operations on China with aircraft and vessels, Song said.  In 2021, US large spy planes carried out about 1,200 aerial close-in reconnaissance sorties on China, with US aircraft carrier strike groups, amphibious ready groups and nuclear-powered attack submarines repeatedly entering the South China Sea, according to the monitoring by the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a Beijing-based think tank.  This increases the risk of an accident and could lead to serious consequences, and the US must stop making such provocations, or the Chinese military would have to deal with them, experts said.  The two defense ministers also discussed the situation in Ukraine, and China urged the US not to use the Ukraine issue to throw mud at, threaten and pressure China.  First conversation  This is the first time Wei and Austin have had a direct conversation since Austin became Pentagon chief, observers noted.  In May 2021, Western media reported that Austin had yet to talk to Chinese military leaders "despite repeated attempts," but that was because Austin, in an unprofessional and unfriendly actof disregarding diplomatic protocol and international common practice, requested to meet with Xu Qiliang, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, instead of Wei, sources told the Global Times at the time.  This time, it was also the US side that proposed the call, but with the right person, observers pointed out.  A reason why the US requested the call is probably because the US acknowledges China as its greatest strategic competitor, but in the meantime the risk of a real conflict must be avoided, analysts said.  Another reason is that the US might want China's help with the Ukraine crisis, and put pressure on China over its ties with Russia amid the Ukraine crisis, but its attempt to sow discord between China and Russia is bound to be futile, Song said.  China-US relations, as the most important relations in the world, have big influence potentials on the Russia-Ukraine issue, Song pointed out, noting that the US is fanning the flames and stirring up troubles at the cost of the Russians, Ukrainians and Europeans to serve its own hegemonic interests, and China on the other hand is promoting talks and peace.  The anonymous foreign affairs expert said that the US might be worried whether China could have some sorts of military coordination and cooperation with Russia.  China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly said that it is disinformation from the US that Russia has asked China for military assistance, and China's position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear, as China has been playing a constructive part in promoting peace talks.

Photo:China Military  High speeds and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the trends in the development of future helicopters, a top Chinese military helicopter designer said during a recent public lecture, giving a glimpse into the possibilities of the country's next-generation choppers, which could feature completely new designs and configurations.  The world has made concrete steps in the development and application of high-speed rotorcraft, with the US commissioning the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor transport aircraft and conducting test flights for the S-97 Raider and SB-1 Defiant helicopters. Within 10 years, it will be the norm for helicopters, or rotorcraft in general, to feature high speeds, Wu Ximing, deputy head of the Chinese Aeronautical Establishment, said during the lecture organized by the China Science and Technology Museum on Sunday.  Unlike the traditional configuration of previous helicopters, the new ones will have very different designs, including those that were made to break the physical speed limit of about 300 kilometers an hour restricted by the traditional design, said Wu, who is also the chief designer of the Z-10, the main battle attack helicopter used by the Chinese military.  It will require exploration and innovation by helicopter designers to achieve high speeds while maintaining the vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, Wu said.  Since Wu gave a general time frame of 10 years for most helicopters to achieve high speed, it can be expected that China could also reveal its high-speed helicopters within 10 years, a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Monday, requesting anonymity.  China's helicopter makers have reportedly conducted test flights for at least two types of helicopters with innovative designs: one is a blended-wing body multi-rotorvertical takeoff and landing aircraft, the other is a helicopter with a completely different, innovative design.  Helicopters will also be empowered by AI, and this means that a digital helmet or screen could replace the control levers on a helicopter, as AI could understand voice commands from the pilot, give suggestions on flight routes, or even make independent decisions under harsh environments or in complex missions, Wu said. "Intelligent technologies will greatly reduce the workload of the pilot in flying the chopper."  AI will enable the intelligent flight of a single helicopter, the coordinated flight of multiple helicopters, and the autonomous carrying out of missions, according to Wu's presentation.  With the rapid development of information technologies like 5G and 6G, it is possible that the helicopter could get larger computing capacity from ground-based systems through a network, and this could optimize the helicopter's capabilities and enhance its efficiency, Wu said.  The use of AI will apply not only to helicopters, but also to aircraft in general, including fighter jets, the anonymous expert said.  The development of drones is another future trend for helicopters, as drones do not lead to casualties. They are not restricted by a human pilot's physical limits and can be used in harsh environments, Wu pointed out, while they cost less and offer higher survivability.  Miniature drone helicopters are also a viable option in missions like tactical reconnaissance, as they are easy to carry and can penetrate hostile defenses stealthily, Wu said.  China has developed a type of portable reconnaissance drone helicopter dubbed the Hummingbird, which is only 15 centimeters long and weighs only 35 grams, China Central Television reported in February.

Analysts say NATO's disregard of Russia's legitimate concerns on security issues and its continuous expansion is the root cause of the outbreak and escalation of this conflict. If it continues to slim down the small buffer zone left between Russia and itself, the situation will undoubtedly go worse.  DEPLOYMENT IN THE EAST  NATO's eastern flank usually refers to the three Baltic countries, namely Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.  Before the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO deployed one combat force in each of the three Baltic countries and Poland, and implemented a rotation mechanism with non-permanent garrison troops there.  But for now, NATO doubles the size of the four above-mentioned combat forces and declared four new NATO battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia at the NATO summit held last month.  NATO is seen by many as a Cold War vestige, and has been questioned over the necessity of its existence after the end of the Cold War.  The military alliance promised in the 1990s that it would not expand "one inch eastward," according to then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. However, led by the United States, NATO has expanded eastward five times since 1999, increasing the number of member countries from 16 to 30, advancing more than 1,000 km eastward, and reaching the Russian border.  RECRUITMENT IN THE NORTH  In addition to strengthening deployments on the eastern flank, NATO is also recruiting new members on the north wing. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly said that if Finland and Sweden apply to join NATO, NATO will welcome them and ensure that their entrance will be accepted soon.  In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Stoltenberg said that the alliance is "in the midst of a very fundamental transformation" that will reflect "the long-term consequences" of Russia's military operation.  Both Finland and Sweden have long pursued a policy of military non-alignment. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, NATO has failed to win over the two countries several times.  But now Finland and Sweden made some changes in their positions in face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, delivering anti-tank weapons and ammunition to Ukraine.  Some analysts point out that before the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Russia had repeatedly confirmed and confided its red line to both the United States and NATO, for which both showed a total disregard. If NATO continues to fan the flames such as taking in new members, it will lead to further escalation of the situation.  CONFRONTATIONAL GESTURE  When answering a question about the prospect of the countries which may join NATO, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters on Monday that further expansion of NATO, including the admission of Finland and Sweden into the alliance, will not contribute to security in Europe.  "In itself, the alliance is rather a tool sharpened for confrontation. This is not an alliance that ensures peace and stability. Further expansion of the alliance, of course, will not bring additional security to the European continent," the Kremlin spokesman said.  Dmitry Belik, a member of Russia's State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said on Monday that NATO seeks to build up its military presence near the Russian borders, but the entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO will not benefit these countries, and "Russia will not watch this indifferently."  "This issue seriously affects our security, so we will be forced to take retaliatory steps," he told the Izvestia newspaper.  "The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO puts them in a very difficult position," he added.  According to military expert Viktor Litovkin, in the event that Finland and Sweden decide to join NATO, Russia will justifiably strengthen the Russian-Finnish border, as well as the entire water area of the Gulf of Finland.  "Russia will have to strengthen ground forces and air defense, deploy significant naval forces in the Gulf of Finland in the event of Finland and Sweden joining the alliance," the expert noted.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force conducted patrol training over China's island of Taiwan on May 11. Su-35 fighter jets flew over the Bashi Channel in formation with the H-6Ks for the first time, which marks a new breakthrough in island patrol patterns, said Shen Jinke, spokesperson for the PLA air force. Photo:China Military  The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command on Friday organized multi-services and arms, dispatching forces including destroyers, frigates, bombers and fighters, and conducted joint combat alert patrols and drills including maritime assault, in the forefront of the East China Sea and in waters and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan, when a group of US lawmakers were visiting the island. Chinese mainland experts said the pointed military operation not only serves as a warning to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who could still visit Taiwan after "postponing" her travel due to COVID-19 infection, but also goes beyond deterrence by preparing for potential, real actions that would resolve the Taiwan question once and for all when necessary.  The operation targets the US' recent wrong signals on the Taiwan question, as the US' wicked tactics are totally useless and dangerous, Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said on Friday in a press release.  "Those who play with fire will burn themselves. The command troops always maintain high alert and will firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security and regional peace and stability," Shi said.  Six PLA aircraft - four J-16 fighter jets and two J-11 fighter jets - entered Taiwan's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone on Friday, the island's defense authority said.  Senior Colonel Wu Qian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of National Defense, said in a press release on Friday that US congressmen visited the island of Taiwan in a deliberate provocation disregarding China's strong opposition. The visit severely violated the one-China principle and the regulations of the Three Joint Communiqués between China and the US, seriously harmed the political foundation of China-US ties, and caused a further escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Straits.  The PLA Eastern Theater Command's joint combat alert patrols and pointed drills are necessary actions taken based on the current security situation in the Taiwan Straits and the needs to safeguard national sovereignty, Wu said.  China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said clearly that Friday's military operation was targeted at the US congressional delegation's visit to Taiwan island.  The PLA is ready for battle and will take any necessary measure to resolutely crush attempts of interference by external forces and secessionist moves of "Taiwan independence" forces, in order to resolutely safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wu said.  The remarks by the spokespersons came after a delegation composed of six US congressmen arrived in Taiwan for a stopover that analysts said targets the Chinese mainland with the "Taiwan card" and aims for more military sales to the island by hyping "mainland threats."  Veteran anti-China politicians like Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, and Republican member of the Senate budget committee Lindsey Graham were the two notable names in the delegation. They met with the island's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen on Friday.  Spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council also slammed the US congressmen's Taiwan visit on Friday.  Beyond deterrence  Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday that the PLA's operation is a large-scale joint combat exercise organized by the Eastern Theater Command and participated by not only the Navy and Air Force, but also likely other military arms and branches.  It covered a wide region and was pointedly designed to solve the Taiwan question, including taking over the air superiority and the control of the sea, and all of the missions are integrated together, Song said. In addition to waters and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan, the drills also covered the forefront of the East China Sea, and that is because the PLA not only would need to take military actions against "Taiwan independence" forces and their armed forces, it might also have to face the potential military intervention by the US and Japan, he pointed out.  The drills aimed to crush the reckless secessionist illusions, Song said, noting that attempts to deter Taiwan secessionists and their US support now seem to have little effect, and that is why the PLA has to prepare for a real military conflict, and if secessionists and their supporters cross the red line stated by the Anti-Secession Law, the PLA will resolutely turn the exercises and all of the plans into action, and solve the Taiwan question once and for all.  If the US or Taiwan secessionists insist on making further provocations, the PLA could expand the drills in terms of both quality and quantity by adding more forces and more training courses, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on Friday, requesting anonymity.  Friday's patrols and drills mainly practiced taking control of air superiority and the sea and likely did not feature actual landing, as no amphibious landing ships were involved. It is also unknown if the drills practiced long-range precision strikes by the Army's long-range rocket artillery and the Rocket Force's DF ballistic and CJ cruise missiles, while the Navy's two aircraft carriers likely did not participate, observers said.  It is only a matter of time for the PLA's most powerful equipment including the J-20 stealth fighter jets and aircraft carriers to join drills around Taiwan, analysts said.  There is still room for the PLA to be better prepared for battle, and the secessionists and external forces should have a clear idea that the PLA has overwhelming advantages within the first island chain, the expert said.  Earlier this month, media reports suggested that US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could visit the island of Taiwan on April 10. But she then said she tested positive for COVID-19 and had to "postpone" her Asia trip.  The PLA drills on Friday are also a warning to Pelosi, who could still visit Taiwan after her recovery. Analysts told the Global Times that more powerful measures from China await Pelosi if she does visit the island.  Compared with previous reactions by the PLA, Friday's drills more concretely and clearly expressed China's statement that it would use force to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity, Zhuo Hua, an international affairs expert at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy of Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Friday.  US politicians should fully realize the huge risks, as the China-US ties have entered a highly sensitive and complex period. It could be catastrophic to the peace and stability in East Asia if the US cannot contain its domestic faction struggle and makes more provocative moves related to the Taiwan question, Zhuo said.  Wang Jianmin, a senior cross-Straits expert at Minnan Normal University, told the Global Times on Friday that unlike previous announcements that said the PLA's actions around the waters near the Taiwan island were routine, the Friday announcement said directly that the exercise was a response to the US' provocations over the Taiwan question.  After the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine started, the US has intensified provocations over the Taiwan question as it wants to instigate a similar crisis on the island of Taiwan. The Chinese mainland should stay rational in the face of such strategy to prevent falling into the US' trap, but at the same time, the mainland should also clearly and stoutly show its firm resolution and capacity to reunify the country when it is necessary, Wang noted.&nbsp; Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

"The Russian army is constantly recruiting additional units to storm the city, and as of now there are active battles near the Ilyich plant and in the port zone of Mariupol," Motuzyanyk said.  He emphasized that the Russian forces have not gained full control of the city after almost seven weeks since the siege began.  The Ukrainian military recently carried out a tactical operation on joining the forces of two military units in Mariupol and now they are trying to unblock the city, Motuzyanyk said.  On Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said that the 36th Marine Brigade had broken fighting lines and joined the Azov Battalion in Mariupol, strengthening the defense of the city.  Mariupol in eastern Ukraine saw one of the worst violence in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Yuan Hai and Xiang Kun)  Serbia has procured the Chinese FK-3 air defense missile system, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic reportedly confirmed on Wednesday, after reports emerged on Saturday that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force was delivering the air defense equipment via Y-20 large transport aircraft.  As the export version of the PLA's HQ-22, the FK-3 can significantly enhance Serbia's national defense capabilities, at a time when NATO is dividing the world and could complicate the security situation around Serbia, Chinese analysts said on Wednesday.  Serbia procured the Chinese FK-3 air defense missile system transparently, complying with laws and regulations, and it followed procedures, Vucic said, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Wednesday. Vucic was accused by other politicians of "arming the country by the hands of competitors of Europe and NATO."  Serbia has found its own path based on the will of its people, and the Serbian people are proud of themselves for protecting their own country by themselves rather than letting NATO do it in their names, Vucic was quoted in the CCTV report as saying.  The CCTV report came after foreign reports said a large number of the PLA Air Force's Y-20 cargo planeswere spotted in Serbia on Saturday, and speculation claimed that the FK-3 air defense missile system was being delivered to the Serbian military.  The FK-3 is an all-weather, medium-to-long range surface-to-air defense missile system that can carry out missions in complex electromagnetic environments. It can intercept targets including fixed-wing aircraft, drones, cruise missiles, tactical air-to-ground missiles and helicopters, according to promotional materials distributed at previous defense exhibitions.  As a medium-altitude air defense weapon comparable to the US' Patriot air defense missile, the FK-3 missile system can serve as a powerful deterrent against aircraft including fighter jets and bombers that are on missions like defense penetration, precision strikes and bombing, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Wednesday.  It will play a very important role for Serbia at a time when the security situation in Europe is changing, Wang said. As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine goes on, many countries are gravitating toward or away from the West, and the US-led NATO is the one that is dividing the world, he said.  Serbia has been a victim of air raids, so it is natural that the country invests in its air defense capabilities, analysts said. In 1999, NATO launched a 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia, causing thousands of casualties including three Chinese citizens, and displacing hundreds of thousands.  As an air defense system, the FK-3 is defensive in nature, and it will not harm regional peace and stability, experts said.  In order to carry out an annually scheduled cooperation project between China and Serbia, China recently sent transport aircraft of the PLA Air Force to Serbia to deliver normal military goods, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular press conference on Monday, when a reporter asked him to confirm if China recently delivered the HQ-22 air defense system to Serbia, and if the move was related to the current situation in Ukraine.  This project is not targeted at any third party, nor is it related to the current situation, Zhao said, noting that media should not interpret it too much. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

China has accelerated the expansion of its nuclear arsenal because of a change in its assessment of the threat posed by the US, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing people "with knowledge of the Chinese leadership's thinking."  The report comes only days after Admiral Charles Richard, the head of US Strategic Command, claimed on April 5 that China's first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile-launched hypersonic glide vehicle last July is a "technological achievement with serious implications for strategic stability," as the hypersonic vehicle flew 40,000 kilometers for more than 100 minutes, marking "the greatest distance and longest flight time of any land attack weapon system of any nation to date," Richard wrote in the testimony, Bloomberg reported on April 5.  Both the Wall Street Journal and Richard claimed that China has been building more than 100 suspected missile silos in China's remote western region that could be used to house nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the US.  These are pure speculations, and the US has been hyping this topic for a long time, and it is nothing new, Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the Naval Research Academy of the People's Liberation Army, told the Global Times on Monday.  By repeatedly hyping and building up tensions, the US is creating an excuse to expand its own nuclear arsenal, despite the US' nuclear triad leading China in both quality and quantity, Zhang said.  The US is retiring its Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles that entered service in the 1960s, and is now developing the new Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. So it is obvious why the US is finding a reason for this upgrade, a Chinese nuclear strategy expert told the Global Times.  Xu Guangyu, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times on Monday that the US relies on its nuclear capability to maintain its hegemony, so it wants to use the "China threat" theory as an excuse.  The eastward expansion of the US-led NATO would ultimately aim to not only contain Russia, but also China, so hyping China's so-called nuclear expansion is also a way to hype the "China threat" theory, Xu said.  Fu Cong, Director General of the Arms Control Department at the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said in a media briefing in Januarythat China has no plans to drastically expand its nuclear arsenal but will continue to modernize it under the changing security environment.  China is the only major nuclear power in the world to announce the no-first-use policy, and it maintains the minimum level of nuclear capability required to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Zhang said, noting that facing the current needs in national defense, China needs to continue to develop its nuclear arsenal, and the US is exaggerating it.

(eng.chianmil.com.cn/Photo by Liu Shu)  A fleet of six Y-20 cargo planes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force was reportedly spotted in Serbia on Saturday, with observers saying on Sunday that it could be the largest overseas operation by the Chinese domestically developed large transport plane yet, displaying the country's strategic transport capabilities.  Citing commercial flight trackers, US news website thedrive.com reported on Saturday that the six Y-20 aircraft were first spotted heading west in Turkish airspace late Friday night, and later local residents took photos of the Y-20s, which allegedly landed in Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade, Serbia. The aircraft later flew over the Bosphorus Strait in Turkey again on their way back to China.  China has not made an official announcement about the mission as of press time, but the Global Times learned that the Y-20s indeed have carried out such a flight.  A whopping six Y-20 large transport aircraft could mark an unprecedented overseas operation, Chinese military observers said.  It is a new record that an overseas mission features six Y-20s, and it is also very rare to see so many Y-20s being deployed at the same time, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times on Sunday.  The mission reflects a significant improvement in the PLA Air Force's long-range strategic transport capabilities, as well as the large transport aircraft's logistics support and maintenance capabilities in intercontinental flights, Fu said.  It is more difficult to organize a large fleet featuring six Y-20s compared with only one or two of the aircraft, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.  China has used the Y-20 for several missions to Europe in the past. For example, the PLA used a Y-20 to carry 105 members of the PLA honor guardto join the Russian Victory Day parade held in Moscow in June 2020.  Unlike just flying to Russia, it would need the Y-20s to fly through several other countries in order to reach Serbia from China, so China must have had much coordination and communication with these countries and gained their authorization in order to realize the flight, Song said.  The mission of the Y-20s to Serbia remains unknown, with thedrive.com speculating that the aircraft could be delivering the FK-3, the export version of the Chinese HQ-22 surface-to-air missile system, to Serbia.  Analysts told the Global Times that the cargo must be large and heavy to require as many as six Y-20s. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

The test that took place in mid-March was kept quiet for two weeks to "avoid escalating tensions with Russia," CNN reported, citing a U.S. defense official familiar with the matter.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) -- the Pentagon's research and development branch -- said that they completed a free flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC).  This is the second successful flight in the DARPA's HAWC program. Last September, a different vehicle configuration from another contractor team also reached hypersonic flight.  The HAWC is a cooperation program between the DARPA and U.S. Air Force to develop air-launched hypersonic cruise missiles.  Air-breathing vehicles utilize air captured from the atmosphere to achieve sustained propulsion.  The speed and maneuverability of such hypersonic cruise missiles allow both evasion of defenses and quick strikes.  In the defense budget for the fiscal year 2023, the White House asked for 7.2 billion U.S. dollars for developing and fielding long range fires, including hypersonic missiles.  A U.S. government agency has identified 70 efforts related to the development of hypersonic weapons, expected to cost nearly 15 billion dollars between 2015 and 2024.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The growth of China's military strength helps maintain world peace, while the United States is the main culprit and backstage manipulator in undermining world peace and stability, said Wu Qian, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense.  The wars launched by the United States in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries have resulted in severe civilian casualties and loss of property, leading to huge humanitarian disasters, he noted.  The United States has ranked first in military spending for years, accounting for about a quarter of the world's total, the spokesperson said, adding that the United States has the world's largest and most advanced nuclear arsenal and is the only country with chemical weapons stockpiles.  China's socialist system, strategic decision to follow the path of peaceful development, its independent foreign policy of peace, and its cultural traditions of considering peace and harmony as fundamentals determine that the country will pursue a national defense policy that is defensive in nature, Wu said.  The spokesperson also slammed Japan for hyping up China's "lack of transparency" on defense expenditure.  China has been submitting reports on its military expenditure to the United Nations every year since 2008, Wu stressed.  Japan's groundless criticism of China's defense budget aims to seek excuses for its military expansion and breaking the post-war international order, he said.  Japan has consistently increased its defense budget in recent years to develop high-end weapons and create tensions, which is very dangerous and has aroused the high vigilance of the international community, Wu noted.  "We urge Japan to draw lessons from history and be cautious in its words and deeds on military security," he said.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The interim regulations on non-commissioned officers and conscripts, together with several supporting documents issued by the CMC, are aimed at enhancing professionalism and stability among non-commissioned officers, while allowing conscripts to play a more fundamental role in the development of China's military talent, the military authorities said.  They will also help boost the management of PLA soldiers by perfecting the recruitment, training, rank promotion, benefits and demobilization system for non-commissioned officers and conscripts, and will play a vital role in building a high-quality military that follows the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the authorities said.  The new regulations will all go into effect on March 31.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Cui Baoliang)  The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force recently organized a cross-day-and-night, cross-regional maneuver exercise that saw multiple types of fighter jets flying across more than 5,000 kilometers in less than 20 hours, covering different terrains including plateaus and the sea, demonstrating not only the outstanding capabilities of the pilots and warplanes, but also the strong logistics support capabilities of all air bases involved, experts said on Wednesday.  Starting the drills, warplanes including the J-11B and the J-11BS attached to a brigade affiliated with the PLA Air Force took off from an air base in Central China and headed toward an unfamiliar region thousands of kilometers away, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Tuesday.  During the maneuver, the aircraft formation penetrated mock hostile aerial defenses, flew from the plains to the sea, and arrived at the designated air base overcoming fatigue from the extended flight, CCTV reported.  As night fell, the warplanes took off again and started another long-endurance flight and maneuver to another air base, the report said, noting that the whole cross-regional maneuver exercise lasted nearly 20 hours.  "We carried out this long-range flight not only throughout the day and night, but also took off and landed at many unfamiliar air bases. We flew across a variety of terrains with a total range of more than 5,000 kilometers, as the pilots had to deal with not only weather changes as they flew across different regions, but also unexpected mock combat challenges along the way," Guo Enyun, the commander of the brigade, said on CCTV.  A distance of 5,000 kilometers means that, if flying in a straight line, a plane can travel across the entire country, observers said.  "The exercises lasted from the day to early morning as we went through terrains like plains, plateaus and the sea. This honed both our will and skill under realistic combat scenarios," Zhong Haifeng, a pilot at the brigade, was quoted in the report as saying.  The flight paths used in the drills were designed to be close to real combat, as different terrains were taken into consideration in defense penetration and air assault sessions, Gao Ruipeng, a staff officer at the brigade, said in the report.  The mock combat sessions were organized without the red and blue teams knowing each other's plans, and this exercised the pilots' air-to-ground combat and attack capabilities, Gao said.  China is a large country with all kinds of terrains, and fast-flying warplanes may travel across all those places in a short time, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday.  The exercise has demonstrated the outstanding skills of the pilots, who can operate from air bases in different terrains, altitudes, temperatures and weather conditions, which have a huge impact on how aircraft perform, Fu said. It also showed the strong logistics support capabilities of all air bases, which would need to carry out maintenance, refuel and munitions reloading for the aircraft that are not based there.  Aircraft from other regions of China can support the region where reinforcements are needed, analysts said. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

China Sea </title><full-text><![CDATA[    Fishing boats sail across the Qiongzhou Strait as the summer fishing moratorium ended in the South China Sea, Aug 16, 2021. [Photo/Xinhua]  Drills expand in scale and frequency, focus on preparing for real combat, report says  From massive military drills to record spy plane activities, the United States military drastically intensified its presence in the South China Sea last year, which serves to undermine China's security interests and increase the risk of friction in the region, according to Chinese experts.  A report published on Sunday by the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a Beijing-based think tank tracking US military operations with open source data, said the US carried out at least 95 military exercises in the South China Sea last year, 10 more than in 2019.  In August 2021, the US, along with Australia, the United Kingdom and Japan, carried out "Large Scale Exercise 21", its largest naval exercise in 40 years, involving around 25,000 military personnel operating across 17 time zones from Europe to Asia.  Hu Bo, director of the think tank, said the US military has maintained a fairly strong presence near China since 1949, but in recent years it has considerably ramped up its operations in the region and made them more public.  These US military drills not only saw expanding scale and frequency, but also focused on preparing for real combat, with China being the clear target, according to the report.  Around 1,200 sorties of maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft conducted close-in intelligence gathering over the South China Sea last year, the report said.  The US set multiple records in November, including 94 sorties, the greatest number in a single month, and 10 flights, which was the highest number in a single day.  In addition, November also saw the US reach its closest surveillance distance to China's territorial water baseline at 15.9 nautical miles, or around 29 kilometers, said the report. Twelve nautical miles outward from this baseline is China's territorial sea, while water inside the baseline is considered inland waters.  "The US is continuously setting records in terms of the distance between its reconnaissance aircraft and China's territorial sea baseline, which poses increasingly high military risks," the report said.  Meanwhile, US ocean surveillance ships and maritime survey vessels carried out operations for a total of 419 sea days. A sea day is a day spent in transit between port calls.  This meant that there was always at least one of these vessels operating in the South China Sea throughout the entire year, according to the report.  Regarding activities by strategic military forces, the US sent amphibious landing and carrier strike groups to the South China Sea on 12 occasions in 2021, nearly double the previous year's total. Nuclear submarines also made at least 11 transits through the waters, along with 22 sorties by B-1B and B-52H strategic bombers.  Hu said the US' "Indo-Pacific strategy" is deeply related to geopolitics and its desire to maintain maritime dominance in the region. As a result, the US will most likely continue to intensify its military activities near China, such as in the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, he added.  Meanwhile, the US is also encouraging and coordinating its allies, including Japan and Australia, to bolster their military capabilities and continue to stir up trouble in the South China Sea, he said.  This trend is already in motion given the fact that Japan took part last year in 61 joint military drills with the US, while Australia announced it would acquire eight nuclear submarines with help from the US and the UK.  "Japan has become the vanguard of the US' 'Indo-Pacific strategy', which will further support US military operations in the South China Sea," the report said. Australia's acquisition of a nuclear submarine capability will "very likely induce a new round of arms race in the region or even across the globe, and cast a shadow over peace and stability in the South China Sea".  Hu said one of the ramifications of Washington's drastically increased military activities is that its military hardware and personnel would be severely stretched, leading to a greater risk of accidents and friction in the South China Sea.  Recent examples include the USS Connecticut nuclear submarine colliding with an uncharted seamount in the South China Sea last year, and an F-35C fighter jet crashing on an aircraft carrier operating in the region in January.  "In an era of peace, if one country maintains such a powerful military presence close to another country, it is hard for the former to convince people that it is doing it for peaceful purposes," Hu said.  Washington's increased military operations pose a serious threat to China's sovereignty and national security, he said, China will therefore be forced to take necessary measures in response.  Xia Liping, dean of the Institute of International and Public Affairs at Tongji University in Shanghai, said that even as the Ukraine crisis unfolds, the US military has not scaled down its activities in the South China Sea, highlighted by frequent transits of its carrier strike groups and drills in January and February.  "The US views China as a long-term competitor, therefore it is willing to focus its maritime forces in the Asia-Pacific region," Xia said, adding that the increased military activities and the subsequent reporting and hype by US officials and media are also aimed at painting China as a regional threat.

Codenamed Balikatan 2022, the annual joint military drills include 3,800 Filipino and 5,100 US military personnel, making it the largest iteration of the Philippines-US joint drills since 2015, the Xinhua News Agency reported.  Balikatan 2022 will be conducted across the main Luzon island from Monday to April 8, Xinhua reported, noting that the drills will focus on "maritime security, amphibious operations, live-fire training, urban operations, aviation operations, counterterrorism, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief."  US media reports, including one by the AP on Monday, hyped that the drills will be a showcase of US firepower in the northern Philippines near the sea border with the island of Taiwan and also facing the South China Sea.  "China will likely frown on the war drills, given their relative proximity to Taiwan," the AP claimed.  However, the AP report also quoted Philippine military spokesperson Colonel Ramon Zagala as saying that the exercise is "for mutual defense, never for offense," and that "most of the military maneuvers have been planned a year ago and did not consider the recurring tensions in the Taiwan Straits."  Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba told the AP that "We have to engage China, but not in a war, because I know Taiwan is a powder keg." Cagayan is where amphibious landings with limited live-fire maneuvers are scheduled to be held this week.  Some Philippine politicians also expressed concerns that the exercise might threaten regional security, Xinhua reported, quoting presidential candidate and labor leader Ka Leody de Guzman as saying that the Philippines should pursue an independent foreign policy, stressing that the country should not be a "pawn."  By holding the drills, the US is trying to fan the flames and stir up troubles in the Asia-Pacific and benefit from it, just like it has done with the Ukraine crisis, Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the Naval Research Academy of the People's Liberation Army, told the Global Times on Monday.  From a geopolitical point of view, the US is aiming to deter China by rallying more allies and partners, and from an economic point of view, the US wants to sell weapons and equipment to the region, Zhang said.  But judging from the remarks made by the Philippine side, the Southeast Asian country is not going to become a strategic pawn of the US after seeing what the US has done recently in Ukraine and Afghanistan, Zhang said, noting that the Philippines wants to enhance its troops' capabilities but not for offensive purposes.  Ding Duo, a deputy director of the Research Center for Oceans Law and Policy at China's National Institute for South China Sea Studies, warned that despite the ongoing Ukraine crisis, the US is still hyping the situation in the South China Sea, which is a reflection that the US has set its eyes firmly on the Indo-Pacific region.  The US could be seeking a proxy in the region to lead from the front in confronting China, just like what it has done with Ukraine, Ding warned.  China must stay on high alert over US' tactic that could destabilize the region, although countries within the region should see US' intent clearly, the experts said.  The foreign ministers of Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar and Panama will visit China from Thursday to April 4, according to a Monday statement by Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Photo:China Military  The US held more than 100 large-scale military exercises near China last year, practicing and validating several new war concepts targeting the country, a Beijing-based think tank revealed on Sunday, shortly before the US and the Philippines are reportedly about to launch the "largest-ever" joint drills on Monday.  A major reason behind the extensive drills with new tactics is that the US is aiming to contain China but is faced with the rapid development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), and the US military is worried that its traditional instruments of war are becoming obsolete facing the PLA, analysts said.  Based on publicly available information, the US military conducted 95 exercises in and near the South China Sea in 2021, with the actual number exceeding 100, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) said in a report released on Sunday.  Among the 95 drills, 14 consisted solely of arms of the US military, including the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Army and Coast Guard. They featured training courses including anti-ship, anti-submarine, anti-sea mine, amphibious, cyberspace and maritime situational awareness missions.  The other 81 were joint exercises with other countries including those along the coastlines of the South China Sea as well as those from outside the region including Japan, the UK, Australia, India, France and Canada, the SCSPI report said, noting that both the frequency and scale of the drills reached new highs.  In 2021, the US military successively sent strategic platforms including four carrier strike groups, two amphibious ready groups, 11 nuclear-powered attack submarines and carried out 22 bombers sorties. This was in addition to conducting at least 1,200 aerial close-in reconnaissance sorties with large spy aircraft and 419 ship days of maritime survey and surveillance with spy ships to the South China Sea, with an obvious intent to deter China, the SCSPI said.  The US also tried to validate some of its new war concepts like multi-domain operations, expeditionary advanced base operations, distributed maritime operations and littoral operations in a contested environment, as the US now acknowledges that China has the edge in the air and sea within the first island chain, the SCSPI said, citing US documents on the Indo-Pacific Strategy.  The reason why the US military is developing new war concepts is that it knows all established US military bases, including those in Japan and South Korea as well as aircraft carriers, are no longer secure, so it needs more bases and it also needs to make them more mobile in a more distributed manner, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.  The US military is worried and panicked to see the growing combat capabilities of the PLA as the gap between them narrows quickly, so the US is looking not only at developing a new generation of weapons and equipment, but also creating new tactics and ways to engage in combat, Song said.  New technologies, including standoff hypersonic weapons, antiballistic missile technologies, precision strike and missile defense systems, new maritime combat systems, directed energy weapons, next-generation nuclear-powered attack submarines and destroyers are all under development by the US, the SCSPI said.  While the US is attempting to deter its imagined possibility of a "China expansion" by a frontier military presence, excessive deterrence would only result in more resolute countermeasures from China, and that will be the opposite of what the US wants, the SCSPI said.  Deterrence and countermeasures as well as provocation and counter-provocation will be major strategic and tactical questions China and the US will have to deal with in the future, the report said.  The report was released only one day before the annual US-Philippines Balikatan Exercise was scheduled to kick off. Media report said this year's Balikatan Exercise would be the "largest-ever," with about 5,100 US military personnel and 3,800 personnel from the Philippines participating from Monday to April 8 across Luzon.    In 2021, the US military strategy and operation on the South China Sea is featured by deterrence----strengthening forward military presence and targeted activities, to deter the imaginary “China might overreach”.

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Liu Jian)  A top US military commander on Sunday again hyped the so-called militarization by China in the South China Sea by personally participating in an aerial close-in reconnaissance on Chinese islands and reefs in the region together with journalists, which is a move that Chinese analysts said on Monday could be a political farce attempting to copy the Ukraine crisis in the Asia-Pacific, rallying allies, partners and other countries in the region to confront China.  US Indo-Pacific Commander Admiral John C. Aquilino claimed on Sunday that China has "fully militarized" at least three of several islands it built in the South China Sea by arming them with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment, and fighter jets, "in an increasingly aggressive move that threatens all nations operating nearby," AP reported on Monday.  Aquilino made the remarks on board a US Navy P-8A reconnaissance aircraft that flew near the Nansha Islands, including the Meiji, Zhubi and Yongshu reefs, and the aircraft was repeatedly warned by Chinese callers that it illegally entered Chinese territory and should move away, AP reported.  While claiming that the US' main objective in the region is "to prevent war" through deterrence and promote peace and stability, Aquilino said that the US is prepared to fight and win "should deterrence fail," with AP noting that Aquilino leads the largest US command with 380,000 military and civilian personnel covering 36 nations and territories.  The Nansha Islands and adjacent waters are Chinese territories and China has sovereignty over them. It is China's rights to construct necessary facilities on its own territory to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity, just like any other country does, Ding Duo, deputy director of the Research Center for Oceans Law and Policy at China's National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global Times on Monday.  The biggest pusher of militarization in the South China Sea is the US, as the US military has been frequently conducting military operations in the South China Sea even if the country is far from the region, Ding said.  "It is not reasonable that the US disallows China to deploy defensive military facilities on its own territory, while at the same time the US sends warships and warplanes to China's doorsteps in the South China Sea on a daily basis," Ding said.  In 2021, US large spy planes carried out about 1,200 aerial close-in reconnaissance sorties on China, with some of them coming near 20 nautical miles of the Chinese mainland's territorial baseline. US aircraft carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups entered the South China Sea 13 times, more than doubling the activities of 2020, and at least 11 US nuclear-powered attack submarines were spotted in or near the South China Sea, including the Seawolf-class USS Connecticut, which had an accident in the region, according to monitoring from the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a Beijing-based think tank.  US warships also repeatedly trespassed into China's territorial waters in the South China Sea, leading to countermeasures by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to warn them away.  Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times on Monday that these provocative US activities could gather intelligence on the PLA, while also prepare the US for a potential military conflict with China.  It is necessary for China to make proper constructions to safeguard national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and the US has no right to make irresponsible remarks on this, Fu said, noting that the US has made Guam the world's largest island military base, and also built many military bases in countries like Japan and South Korea.  The US is using rouge logic and applying double standards, which make no sense, analysts said.  Despite the ongoing Ukraine crisis, the US is still hyping the situation in the South China Sea, which is a reflection that the US has set its eye firmly in the Indo-Pacific region, Ding said.  In addition to the increasing US military activities in the South China Sea, including drills, reconnaissance operations and military exchanges with countries in the region, the US may also attempt to stir up trouble in the international public opinion and diplomatic fields, Ding warned.  It could be just like what the US has done with Ukraine, as it could seek a proxy in the region to lead from the front in confronting China, with others following, Ding predicted.  By flying personally to the South China Sea with journalists, Aquilino is staging a political farce to win attention and again build up tensions in the region after the world has shifted its eyes to Europe, another Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Monday.  China must pay high attention to the situation, and must not allow the US to copy the Ukraine crisis in the South China Sea, Fu said, noting that the situation in the region, despite its complexity, has been relatively stable recently.

(Photo/Xinhua)  The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has garnered widespread attention across the globe. The wall-to-wall coverage and outpouring of reactions to the Russia-Ukraine conflict from the West has raised eyebrows at its double standard toward other humanitarian crises, which has unsheathed flagrant racist and biased attitudes toward the value of non-white lives that also matter.  CBS News senior correspondent in Kyiv Charlie D'Agata, for instance, has faced a widespread backlash due to his discriminatory comments on the Ukraine crisis: "This isn't a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European – I have to choose those words carefully, too – city where you wouldn't expect that, or hope that it's going to happen," he said.  The seasoned correspondent was forced to apologize later, saying he spoke "in a way I regret." However, his remarks are not part of an isolated incident. Ukraine's former deputy general prosecutor David Sakvarelidze spoke to the BBC, suggesting that it is harder for him to watch white people fleeing the conflict.  "It's very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed," Sakvarelidze said. The BBC presenter responded: "I understand and of course respect the emotion."  Likewise, a visibly emotional ITV News correspondent Lucy Watson proclaimed: "Now the unthinkable has happened to them, and this is not a developing, Third World nation; this is Europe," as if victims from the world's other humanitarian crises had naturally been inclined to expect to wake up to a devastating war.  One French commentator on BFM TV, France's most-watched cable news channel, also came under fire, implying that it's much more conceivable to have attacks in other regions of the world. "We are in a European city and we have cruise missile fire as though we were in Iraq or Afghanistan, can you imagine," he said.  Coverage on the Russia-Ukraine conflict has veered into a troubling tone on race and the international status of migrants. Journalists report on the conflict in shock as if bloodshed was the exclusive purview of non-white communities. Such attitudes are strewn across the West and have underlined the Western side's ingrained double standard – namely, valuing white lives over those dying in conflicts outside Europe.  Ukraine's refugee crisis has revealed the West's double standards even more clearly. Whopping numbers of people have fled Ukraine, and they are being welcomed as refugees should be by countries across Europe that previously closed their doors to others.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict has witnessed Western countries' tremendous "solidarity" – providing a steady flow of "support" – in response to the humanitarian crisis. However, Ukraine is not the only country suffering from a humanitarian crisis. Why do these Western countries treat humanitarian crises outside Europe with indifference and unspeakable brutality?  "[Afghan people] must be wondering what makes their humanitarian crisis so unimportant. Is it the color of their skin? Is it that they are not white? They're not European? That their problems come from a U.S. gun or a U.S. invasion," Irish Member of the European Parliament, Clare Daly questioned, denouncing Western countries for treating other humanitarian crises much more lightly compared to the Ukraine crisis.  Trivializing wars in the Middle East and dehumanizing entire populations is not new in the West. The past decades have witnessed Western countries' brazen attitude toward wars in the Middle East that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of people. Missiles from the U.S. landed in the Middle East frequently, but voices from Western media disappeared and reactions were subdued quickly. Casualties in the Middle East seem to be more tolerable to Western media and politicians than those in the present Ukraine crisis, as years of dehumanization have turned the Middle Eastern people into nothing but a statistic confined to the unread columns of newspapers.  CNN political correspondent Julia Ioffe made a horrific comparison between Syria and Ukraine in a clip circulating on social media, which displays the most egregious ramifications of the West's dehumanization of the Middle East. "It's one thing for sarin gas to be used on people far away Syria who are Muslim and who are of a different culture but what is Europe going to do when it's used on European soil on Europeans," she said, suggesting people from the Middle East are inferior to Europeans and that it is somehow acceptable for them to be killed.  The vastly different treatment received by Ukrainians and those of Middle Eastern nationalities on the part of Western countries, in addition to the casual racism displayed in Western coverage of the Ukraine crisis, has laid bare Western biases, prejudices and double standards, which should be of no surprise. In fact, no life is worth more than another. So until Western countries do away with its racist double standard and treat humanitarian crises with equal weight, it simply has "no credibility," just as Daly opined with great gusto in front of the cameras of Western media.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

"It takes about one to two months for dozens of technicians and workers to manufacture a gas rudder (used on a cruise missile) with traditional machining methods because it involves a succession of processes like casting and welding," said Zhang Chunhu, a senior technician at CASIC's Third Academy. "And a rudder is only a small part on a missile, so you can imagine how much manpower and time it takes to build a whole cruise missile by traditional means.  "But now, with 3D printing technology, a handful of workers can make a rudder within a week. The 3D-printing-enabled procedure can save us a great deal of labor, time and cost, and is much better than mechanical machining when it comes to weight and accuracy control for our products."  Zhang said a mechanically made rudder has rough surfaces that require workers to use machines and a lot of time to smooth them, and during that process, a large proportion of metal is chopped off and wasted. By comparison, a 3D printed one has very smooth surfaces with a tiny amount of redundant material－usually just a few grams－which means it is almost ready for installation on a missile.  "Thanks to 3D printing technology, our production efficiency and quality have substantially improved," Zhang said.  Jiao Shikun, an engineer at the academy's Technological Innovation Center for Additive Manufacturing, said 3D printers have enabled workers to increase the raw material utilization rate by dozens of times when it comes to manufacturing large missile components. The "printed" products have higher structural strength and a better pass rate, he added.  He said CASIC's Third Academy is the largest user of 3D printers in China's aerospace industry, and its technicians are using the technology to make many cruise missile parts such as engines and fuselage panels.  Zhang and Jiao said they will cooperate with weapons designers at the academy to introduce 3D printing technology in the design of new missiles.  "Designers can consider which components are suitable to be 'printed'. This technology can give engineers more space for imagination and innovation and allow them to design advanced, sophisticated components that would be difficult for traditional methods to manufacture but easy for 3D printers," Zhang said. "It is no exaggeration to say that 3D printing technology will revolutionize the design work of missiles."  The technology also has huge potential in the academy's production of unmanned aircraft, he said.  Wu Peixin, a defense industry observer in Beijing, said it is likely that in the future, 3D printers will be taken to the battlefield to allow soldiers to print and assemble missiles on the spot based on their needs.  China's aviation and space industries have used 3D printers widely on their production lines. Chinese scientists also carried out space-based 3D printing experiments on the country's new-generation manned spacecraft during its first flight test in May 2020.

"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Organizing Committee cannot pledge at this moment to hold next year's Asian Cup competition under a fully open model. After negotiations between the AFC, the Chinese Football Association (CFA) and the Local Organizing Committee, a joint decision has been made to remove the 2023 Asian Cup from China to a new host which is to be confirmed soon," read a statement published by the Chinese Organizing Committee.  "The Organizing Committee hereby expresses sincere gratitude to the AFC, all host cities and the whole society for their great support during the tournament's preparations," the statement added.  The AFC said in a separate statement that it appreciates that China, the CFA and the Local Organizing Committee have made "this very difficult but necessary decision in the collective interests of the AFC Asian Cup 2023, which has also provided the AFC the required time to assess the situation regarding the hosting of the AFC Asian Cup 2023."  "The AFC worked closely with the CFA and the AFC Asian Cup China 2023 Local Organizing Committee during the preparations and several milestones were achieved, including the launch of the tournament logo and the unveiling of the newly completed Shanghai Pudong Football Stadium last year," the Asian football governing body added.  Details about the next steps related to the hosting of the Asian Cup will be announced in due course, the AFC said.  China was awarded the hosting right of the 2023 Asian Cup in June 2019. The 24-team competition was scheduled to be hosted across 10 Chinese cities. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Although India's first singles Lakshya Sen could not challenge world No. 1 Viktor Axelsen, his team took a 2-1 lead after three matches.  As the semifinal entered the deciding match after Denmark tied the score in the second doubles, India's remarkable run at the tournament seemed to come to an end when H.S. Prannoy twisted his ankle early in the first set. But he bounced back to win the match 13-21, 21-9, 21-12 against Rasmus Gemke.  In the other semifinal, Indonesia cruised into the final again after Anthony Sinisuka Ginting, as well as Mohammad Ahsan/Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, secured a 2-0 lead before Japan put up a tough fight to force a tie. In the third singles match, Shesar Hiren Rhustavito fended off Kodai Naraoka to take the victory for Indonesia. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

In a repeat of the Thomas Cup final last year, in which Indonesia swept China to claim the trophy, both teams made changes to their line-ups this time.  China sent Zhao Junpeng instead of top-ranking Lu Guangzu against Indonesia's Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. Zhao put on an epic struggle in the second set to tie the match but his last-ditch efforts fell short in the third and lost by 21-12, 25-27 and 21-17.  In the following doubles match, the combination of Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo and Mohammad Ahsan, ranked top and second respectively in the world, proved too good for the Chinese duo Liu Yuchen/Ou Xuanyi to handle as Indonesia extended its lead.  In the following singles, China's Li Shifeng couldn't improve from his defeat by Jonatan Christie in the last Thomas Cup final and went down in straight sets (21-13, 21-18) that saw Indonesia advancing to the semifinals.  The defeat also marked only the second time in 40 years that the Chinese men's team failed to reach the Thomas Cup semifinals following an early exit in 2016.  Indonesia will continue its quest for a back-to-back championship with a semifinal clash against Japan, while India and Denmark meet in the other semifinal. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"Our only chance to qualify for Paris 2024 is to earn as many ranking points as possible in the next couple of events," China head coach Wu Sheng told Xinhua on Tuesday.  At Paris 2024, world rankings will play a bigger role in the definition of quotas, as a result of FIVB's change to the sport's Olympic qualification system.  As host nation, France is entitled to one quota for both men's and women's tournaments. For the remaining 11 quotas for each gender, six will be defined by three Olympic qualification tournaments, to be played in September and October 2023.  The three Olympic qualification tournaments will feature eight teams each - 24 total - defined by the FIVB rankings of September 12, 2022 (men) and October 17, 2022 (women). The top two teams in each tournament will qualify for Paris 2024. The five remaining Olympic places will be decided using the FIVB rankings in June 2024, prioritizing countries from continents that do not yet have qualified teams in the Olympic tournament.  China's national team is currently training in Jiangmen, Guangdong Province, for the opening VNL game against Iran.  "We will try our best in the VNL and the World Championships so that we can earn enough points to qualify for the Olympic Qualification tournaments," said Wu.  Wu, who was appointed head coach of China's men's team in October 2020, has handpicked a young squad made up of players mainly born after 1999. Despite a lack of international experience, he is full of praise for his players' physical conditions.  "Our height is not inferior to that of the world's top teams, and many of our players have great bounce," Wu said.  "Zhang Jingyin, for instance, has a vertical jumping height of 3.70 meters."  "Unlike women's games, which focus more on tactics, the trend of men's volleyball lies in a higher, faster, more powerful and all-round attacking line," he added.  Wu said that after studies on other elite teams, the coaching staff found that improving the team's serving and receiving is the top priority for the Chinese team.  "One can only apply enough strength when he serves and receives right. We have been training our players with the help of additional equipment so that they learn and improve in real-time," said Wu.  Besides working on skills, another concern for Wu is the difficulty in knowing at what level China currently stands in the world after skipping many international events over the past two years due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, Wu is determined to qualify for the Paris Olympics.  "The players do well in training, and the young players like to play football and basketball in their spare time to reduce pressure. The goal of advancing to the Olympic qualifiers remains unchanged. We will try to seize this opportunity," Wu said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Wang Teng)  BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China closed up the Uber Cup group stage with its third victory and cruised into the quarterfinals after strolling past Chinese Taipei 5-0 here on Tuesday.  A potential top-level clash in the opening singles didn't materialize as former world no.1 Tai Tzu Ying was absent from Chinese Taipei's lineup. Her teammate Hsu Wen Chi could not stop Olympic champion Chen Yufei who won 21-15 and 21-13.  China went on to win the four remaining matches with the only surprise coming from Sung Shuo Yun who snatched the opening set against He Bingjiao, who then staged a rally to take the match 2-1.  The three victories in the group stage allowed China to top the group and advance into the quarterfinals. A draw will decide China's opponent in the quarterfinals after all group matches conclude on Wednesday.  Rio Olympic gold medalist Carolina Marin made her first appearance in the Uber Cup as Spain beat Australia 4-1. But the efforts fell short as Chinese Taipei secured the other place in the group to qualify for the quarterfinals.

The Chinese side were under constant pressure throughout their failed World Cup qualification and it took a heavy toll on their away game against Vietnam in early February, according to Xu.  "Before that game all of us were preoccupied with one thought: we cannot afford to lose the game, we cannot afford any hiccup during the game," he said.  "This brought huge pressure to us, which badly affected our performance. Admittedly, we were not good enough to be completely sure of beating Vietnam."  "Vietnam made impressive progress over the past few years, they were probably determined to beat us in that game," he added.  The defeat to Vietnam meant the Chinese side's slim chance to qualify for the World Cup finals was shattered with two more games left. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The fitness level of the naturalized player, also known as Nico Yennaris, has been a concern for Chinese media and Beijing Guoan supporters as he has been out of action since late November when he received an ankle operation in England.  Li Ming, general manager of the Beijing club, said in early April that Beijing Guoan already had a well-equipped squad and he was not sure if Li could be included in the team list for the first half of this season's Chinese Super League campaign.  "I cannot guarantee he will be on the list for the first half of the season," he then said.  The Beijing side has been greatly reinforced after the arrival of Nigerian striker Samuel Adegbenro, Croatian forward Marko Dabro, South Korean defender Kang Sang-Woo and Bosnia and Herzegovina defender Samir Memisevic.  The kickoff date of the 2022 Chinese Super League season remains undecided due to the latest wave of COVID-19 cases. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The FISU said in a news release that the decision was made following extensive discussions between FISU, the Chengdu 2021 Organizing Committee and other stakeholders.  The FISU Games had initially been scheduled for the summer of 2021 but were rescheduled for June this year following the postponement of the Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020.  "The decision to reschedule Chengdu 2021 is not one that was made easily, but it is the right decision for university athletes. Their welfare is always our number one priority. Continued uncertainty over conditions has made rescheduling the sensible choice - a number of National University Sports Federations had already changed their plans," said Acting FISU President Leonz Eder.  "Taking a team to the FISU World University Games is a great responsibility and FISU is confident that this decision will enable the greatest possible number of university athletes to attend next year."  Despite the postponement, Eder paid tributes to the Chengdu organizers for their preparatory work over the past three years.  "The Chengdu organizing committee has made great efforts for the preparatory work since its successful bid. FISU thanks the Chengdu Organizing Committee for its hard work," said Eder.

She was playing right midfield and made some accurate diagonal passes toward her fellow forward players before they completed promising shots on the goal.  Few of the men on the pitch, however, realized that this woman playing among them was a member of the winning team that took home the AFC Women's Asian Cup back in 2006.  Her shiny medal in her trophy room refreshes the memory for many football fans, men or women, as China was crowned the same title once again 16 years later after defeating South Korea on February 6.  Though she is no longer capable of running, dribbling, passing and shooting like she could on the pitch 16 years ago, her football story and experience lives on.    Zhang Tong high fives a youth player during a training session on February 26, 2022 (People’s Daily Online/Peng Yukai)  Past glory  “It was a long time ago, but the glory still remains in our hearts,” said Zhang as she looks back to the championship journey in 2006. Having been benched during all three games during the group stage, Zhang was substituted during the semi-final and played a crucial role in the 1-0 win against DPRK. While people still have high expectations for the team, Zhang still remembers the stress that spread among the players and coaches before the final.  “The atmosphere in the team was really stressful,” said Zhang. “Coach Ma Liangxing asked me if I was ready the day before the game, and I said yes even though I wasn’t 100 percent ready.” However, Zhang quickly adjusted herself and she was substituted in the 31st minute during the final against Australia, when China was then down by two goals.  “I was really pumped when I ran onto the field, and all the stress was gone.” Playing as the central midfielder, Zhang kept the pressure on the opponent’s defense, which helped China equalize the game in the second half, as well as eventually winning the penalty shoot-out.&nbsp;    Photo taken on March 23, 2022, shows all the metals that Zhang Tong has won in her career. (People’s Daily Online/Peng Yukai)  “When you look back on what you’ve done, you still feel a sense of pride,” said Zhang. “Playing for our national team and watching the national flag rise is the utmost honor for every professional football player, and winning the championship makes this glory even precious.”  Start over from the grassroot  After a 16-year professional career, Zhang decided to hang up her boots in 2012. However, life after retirement was not as easy as Zhang originally thought.  “(I was) really puzzled and confused. I didn’t know what I could do or what I should do,” said Zhang. Luckily, the uncertainty of being unemployed didn’t last too long, and Zhang started working for a professional football club in Beijing. At the same time, Zhang also started to apply for coaching credentials to prepare for her coaching career.  “The reason why I applied for coaching credentials is because coaching is what I am aimed to do, and I hope I can utilize my past experience and pass them along to those younger players, especially to all the kids.”  After working for a professional football club for a few years, Zhang gradually turned her focus to youth training. Eventually, she became the youth training director at Jujia Football Club, a club focuses on youth football training based in Daxing District in Beijing.  Compared to coaching players at other age levels, Zhang has a special fondness for coaching children. In her opinion, coaching children is challenging, yet interesting. “There are a lot of factors that you need to put into consideration before coaching a group of children, (such as) their physical and psychological conditions, as well as their level of understanding,” said Zhang. However, Zhang also felt a sense of relief when the kids come up with some bizarre questions, which added some humor and laughter to her routine job.&nbsp;    Zhang Tong consoles a youth player after a training session at a practice field on February 26, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Peng Yukai)  One step at a time  With China having won the Women’s Asian Cup again after 16 years, the expectations and enthusiasm for Chinese football has once again been ignited among the public. While people are curious about when China will have its next super football star, Zhang instead keeps calm about the vague future of Chinese football as well as youth football training.  “We need to take one step at a time,” said Zhang. “The meaning of being a youth football coach is to guide our children to get involved in football, and we as coaches should teach them the right value instead of expecting them to reach a certain result. Throwing apart all the result, we must make sure that we are teaching the right things to our kids.”&nbsp;    Youth players in the middle of a training session at a practice pitch on February 26, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Peng Yukai)  In terms of what she wants her students to achieve, the very first word that comes up to her mind is happiness. “I hope every one of the kids who come here to play football is happy, and this is what football is all about.”  Having stepped away from the spotlight and applause for almost a decade, Zhang has never felt lonely about her current life. Instead, she holds a strong sense of responsibility. “I just want to live my everyday life,” said Zhang. “Football is the greatest asset of my life, and I want to contribute all my effort to football at no matter how old I am.” Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Zhai Zheng/Xinhua)  LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Ronnie O'Sullivan beat Judd Trump 18-13 on Monday to win the World Snooker Championship title for the seventh time, equaling the record held by Stephen Hendry.  The world number one returned to the table on Monday with a 12-5 lead from Sunday, but the 2019 world champion Trump fought hard to close the gap within three frames at 14-11.  In the final session, the Rocket dominated the table again, winning the world title at the age of 46 to become the oldest champion in the season-ending tournament.  "That's probably the greatest result I've ever had," O'Sullivan told the World Snooker Tour website after clinching his 39th ranking title. "As far as I'm concerned, Judd is already an all-time great. The way he plays the game, he plays such dynamic snooker."  O'Sullivan took his first world title in 2001 by beating John Higgins in the final. After more than two decades, these two great players are still in their top forms as they met in the semifinals at the Crucible Theatre this year with O'Sullivan outplaying his long-time rival 17-11.&nbsp;    England's Ronnie O'Sullivan celebrates with the trophy during the awarding ceremony after the final over England's Judd Trump at the Betfred World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, England, May 2, 2022.

Real Madrid won 4-0 and claimed 35th La Liga title. (Xinhua/Meng Dingbo)  MADRID, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid sealed its 35th La Liga title thanks to a 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday afternoon.  Two first half goals from Rodrygo and further strikes from Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema saw Carlo Ancelotti's men to an easy win against a rival that looked like an uninvited guest at the celebrations.  Ancelotti has now won league titles in Spain, England, France, Germany and Italy.  Sevilla's hopes of finishing second suffered a setback when they were held 1-1 at home to struggling Cadiz on Friday night.  Youssef En-Neysri's first half header for just his fourth league goal of the season, put Sevilla ahead, but a dogged Cadiz got their reward in the second half thanks to Lucas Perez's excellent free kick.  Atletico Madrid's fourth place also looks in doubt as they were beaten 2-0 away to Athletic Club Bilbao, who keep their hopes of playing in Europe next season alive with an impressive win.  Inaki Williams' eighth minute cross was deflected into his own net by Atletico defender Mario Hermoso as Athletic dominated the first 25 minutes.  Atletico began the second half brightly, but after Antoine Griezmann had rattled the crossbar with a free kick, Williams netted Athletic's second from the penalty spot after Iker Muniain had been fouled.  Although Angel Correa saw a deflected shot rebound off the post in injury time, Atletico never looked like recovering from the second goal.  The result leaves Athletic a point behind seventh place Villarreal, who suffered a hangover from their Champions League semi-final against Liverpool with a 2-1 defeat away to Alaves.  First half goals from Victor Laguardia and Gonzalo Escalante gave Alaves a 2-goal cushion and the side from Vitoria held on to climb above Levante after Samuel Chukwueze pulled a goal back for Villarreal two minutes into the second half.  Oscar Duarte scored an 81st minute equalizer for Levante to cancel out Hugo Duro's first half opening goal for Valencia in the city derby.  Levante slipped back to bottom of the table after missing chances to win the game after Valencia defender Jose Luis Gaya was sent off for a direct red card after 31 minutes.  Levante made 24 shots in the game but collected only one goal from Duarte on 81 minutes. Duro caught the only chance on target for Valencia in the 27th minute.&nbsp;    Real Madrid's players celebrate the victory after a Spanish La Liga football match between RCD Espanyol and Real Madrid in Madrid, Spain, on April 30, 2022.

O'Sullivan, 46, reached the final in the Crucible Theatre for the eighth time as the world number one beat long-time rival Higgins 17-11.  If the Rocket beats Trump on Monday, he will equal Stephen Hendry's record of seven world titles.  "I am not focused on titles, what I have won and haven't won," O'Sullivan told the World Snooker Tour website. "It's more about the experience and enjoying it. When I won this title in 2020 it didn't change my life. If I win it again I'm not sure I will feel overly elated. But it would still be nice to have."  The 32-year-old Trump held off a sizzling Williams as the 47-year-old fought hard from seven frames behind to lead at 16-15. But the 2019 world champion Trump held his nerve to win the last two frames, reaching the final for the third time.  "I said it in every round that it is a free shot and I don't expect anything of myself," said Trump. "I felt a lot better yesterday, like I did against John in 2019. I feel like I am close to being at my best." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The athletes’ village for the Chengdu 2021 FISU World University Games (Photo courtesy of the Executive Committee of the Chengdu 2021 FISU World University Games)  “The University Games will be a grand event for youth. The gathering of youth from all over the globe will be a great opportunity to spread the concept of green and low-carbon development,” introduced an official from the Executive Committee of the Chengdu 2021 FISU World University Games Summer.  The city, the first one in western China to hold an international multi-sporting event, has made the best use of its existing venues. Only 13 out of the total 49 venues are newly built. Energy conservation measures and green construction materials were used in the construction process, while all the venues will remain in use after the games come to a close.  Clean energy, such as wind power and hydrogen power from the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in the province, will be consumed at the venues, the main media center as well as the Universiade Village.  Moreover, the number of new-energy vehicles (NEV) to be used during the event, such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and battery-powered electric vehicles, will hit a record high. Chengdu Public Transport Group Co., Ltd has allocated 1,380 new-energy buses for the transportation of athletes and technical staff, and is working to improve charging infrastructure to further increase the usage of NEVs during the games.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Yan, 22, is making his fourth appearance in Crucible Theater, Sheffield as he booked his place in the year-ending tournament with a world ranking of 16.  The 2021 Masters champion showed great composure and patience, winning the longest ever frame in the history of the World Championship after more than 85 minutes to take a 12-10 lead before finishing the last frame with a break of 112.  "I just felt very very tired after the long frame," said Yan. "Too many safeties from both of us...He just missed the best chance to back to tie at 11 each."  Yan is going to meet three-time world champion Mark Williams as the 47-year-old stormed to the round of last eight by outclassing Jackson Page 13-3 on Friday.  "He has been playing very well at this year's World Championship. He's very confident, very strong. But I'm the same, confident and strong," said Yan.  Earlier, Yan's compatriot Zhao Xintong lost to Stephen Maguire 13-9 in the second round. The other Chinese players Ding Junhui and Lyu Haotian both failed to pass the opening round.  Maguire will face six-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan as the world No. 1 reached the quarterfinals at the World Championship for the 20th time after sweeping Mark Allen 13-4.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Both Chinese teams fielded second-string as clubs are prepare the domestic Chinese Super League whose opening date is yet to be decided.  Kawasaki made 10 changes to their starting line-up from their opening 1-1 draw with Ulsan Hyundai of South Korea in Group I, but it took just seven minutes for the J-League champions to open their account, when Kei Chinen headed home from a corner.  Guangzhou's defenders could barely keep up with their opponents and Kawasaki were already leading 4-0 after Yu Kobayashi buried his own missed penalty in the 21st minute. The score was 5-0 at half-time. Kawasaki went on to score three more goals in the second half to end the one-sided match 8-0.  In Group F, Shandong Taishan held Urawa Red Diamonds until the 26th minute when Takahiro Akimoto broke the deadlock with repeated attempts inside the box. Akimoto then soon won a penalty, which was converted by Alexander Scholz to give the reigning Emperor's Cup champions a 2-0 lead.  Urawa kept their dominance into the second half. Two goals by substitute Alex Schalk, including a free-kick from distance, extended the lead to 4-0.

Zhao, 25, qualified for the final stages of the year-ending tournament with a highest career ranking of world number seven.  After the first session on Saturday, Zhao comfortably led Clarke 7-2. When they returned to the table on Sunday, Zhao took three frames in a row to reach the last 16.  "This is my first win at the Crucible so I'm very happy," Zhao was quoted as saying by the World Snooker Tour website. "I need more confidence for the next match, so this win is very important to me."  Zhao competed at the 2019 World Championship, but lost to Mark Selby in the opening round. He made a breakthrough this season by winning his maiden ranking title at the UK Championship last December, before adding another trophy in the German Masters.  "Even when I was 9-2 up I still felt pressure and I needed to finish the match quickly so that the pressure didn't build," said Zhao.  Elsewhere, world number one Ronnie O'Sullivan, who is making his 30th appearance at the Crucible Theatre, defeated David Gilbert 10-5.  "Whatever I'm doing now I try to be the best I can be," said the six-time world champion. "30 appearances doesn't really mean anything to me. I want to be a champion and do the business. That's what I'm proud of. I don't care about centuries, I don't care about maximums. I just care about how many majors I've won. It's all about those."

(Xinhua/Xu Zijian)  China has named a mixture of youth and experience in its women's volleyball squad.  BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese national women's volleyball team revealed its new recruits here on Thursday with several fresh faces first time listed among the legendary side.  The new names include young players Wu Mengjie and Wang Yizhu who may be seen as the reinforcement for star spiker Li Yingying, as well as spiker Jin Ye, setter Wang Yunlu and libero Xu Jianan.  China's international volleyball stars Zhu Ting and Zhang Changning were both not called up due to injury.  But the list also includes some veteran players such as 32-year-old setter Ding Xia.  Gong Xiangyu and Yuan Xinyue, who have attended both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympics, represent "middle-age" players, the main force on the team.  After Cai Bin took over the reins from the legendary coach Lang Ping, the national team assembled players from all over China for testing and selecting procedures.  "This recruitment aims for preparing the incoming FIVB Women's World Championship and the 2022 Asian Games," according to an announcement from China Volleyball Association (CVA).  "We want to assemble players from different age groups when forming the new national team so that the young players can get tested and grow up," Cai said.  "Also, we've considered recruiting the middle-years who have potential and the veterans with experience in international competitions.  "But the door is still open for the newcomers," he added.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Su, who clinched a silver in slopestyle and the gold medal in Big Air at Beijing 2022, said, "I wish I could win the Grand Slam and hear the national anthem in more events." The Chinese won a World Cup title in the United States in 2021.  The 18-year-old snowboarding prodigy considers the Big Air Shougang, where he won his first Winter Olympic gold medal, as a "blessed place".  "Three years ago, I competed in my first World Cup here. At that time, I had the goal to get the best result in Beijing," he said.  "Hard work pays off," Su said. "When I decided to become a professional, I knew I would be a long way to be the top athlete in the world, but I was always working hard."  Many young people regard Su as a role model after his overnight success at the Beijing Winter Olympics. Su noticed teenagers' enthusiasm for winter sports and hoped that his experience would inspire them.  Su gave them this advice: "Find what you're passionate about, believe in yourself, and give it your all. One day, your dream will come true."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Xiaopeng is likely to resign as head coach of China's national football team following his side's dismal FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Chinese media reported on Wednesday.  China, whose failed World Cup qualification campaign culminated in a 2-0 loss to Oman on March 29, drew once and lost three times under Li, who took over from previous incumbent Li Tie in December.  When Li Xiaopeng took the reins with the national team, he treated the final four World Cup qualifiers as a test in which he failed, according to a report in the Guangzhou-based Soccer News.  "With circumstances conspiring against him, in all likelihood he will tender his resignation," the report said.  Following China's loss to Oman in March, when asked by the media if he had the confidence to transform his team which he accused of being resigned to defeats, Li was evasive in his reply, before conceding that it would be difficult.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

It was the first time that Chinese people had reached the top of the world’s highest peak, and also the first time that mankind had climbed to the summit of Mount Qomolangma from its northern slope.    Members of the China Tibet Mountaineering Team pose for a group photo after reaching the summit of Mount Qomolangma in 1999. (Photo/Courtesy of sports bureau of Tibet autonomous region)  “In those years, our climbing gear was quite rudimentary. Since we didn’t have metal ladder, we built a human ladder to climb the mountain. We thought we must reach the summit, even if only one of us could do it,” said the Tibetan climber Gonpo, who can still vividly recall the feat of great daring.  “The first thing we did after reaching the top of the mountain was to erect our national flag. We wanted to show the world that Chinese people can do it,” Gonpo added.  On Oct. 1, 1960, Tibet mountaineering camp, which later became the China Tibet Mountaineering Team, was established, with Gonpo and his fellow teammates who took part in the ascent of Mount Qomolangma in 1960 forming the backbone of the camp.  After the first successful ascent of the world’s tallest mountain in 1960, generations of Tibetan mountaineers have continued to create new world records for mountaineering: more than 300 people have scaled Mount Qomolangma; over 460 people have reached the tops of mountains that are more than 8,000 meters in height; three people have conquered all the world’s 14 peaks above the altitude of 8,000 meters; and two members of the China Tibet Mountaineering Team have accomplished the magnificent feat of reaching the summits of the highest mountains on each of the world’s seven continents and trekking to the South and North Poles.  In 2020, when the 60th anniversary of the China Tibet Mountaineering Team was marked, a Chinese survey team reached the summit of Mount Qomolangma and remeasured the height of the peak, which is 8,848.86 meters. At the same time, the team set a new record for the longest stay on the top of the peak by Chinese people.    Tourists enjoy spectacular scenery at the foot of Mount Qomolangma, August 26, 2020. (People’s Daily Online/Peng Huan)  “Mountaineers from the China Tibet Mountaineering Team have played a part in all the important activities and major events involving the sport of mountain climbing, including pushing the limits of mountaineering, remeasuring the height of Mount Qomolangma, and the Olympic torch relay at the summit of the peak,” said Sonam, head of the China Tibet Mountaineering Team.  The team has also carried out, on behalf of China, joint mountaineering activities with many countries and regions, making mountaineering a major leverage to build China into a country strong on sports and an important bridge for exchanges between China and foreign countries, according to Sonam.  As times change, the sport of mountain climbing has also become increasingly rich in content, with rock climbing, ski mountaineering and other events deriving from it gradually.  Nevertheless, the spirit of being fearless of danger and difficulty, tenacity, solidarity and cooperation, and scaling new heights has been carried forward by mountaineers in Tibet from generation to generation.  “In addition to maintaining our strengths in mountaineering expedition, we also need to strive for better performance in competitions,” said Ngawang Tashi, deputy head of the China Tibet Mountaineering Team.  After Beijing and its neighboring city Zhangjiakou in north China’s Hebei province won the bid to host the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, the China Tibet Mountaineering Team took the preparations for the sports event and China’s vision of involving 300 million people in winter sports as an opportunity to boost the development of ice and snow sports in Tibet, and set up the first skiing training team of the region.  The team selected outstanding athletes, regardless of their professional backgrounds, for cross-country skiing, snowboarding, and ski mountaineering.  “Within less than four to five years, these young athletes who used to be completely new to skiing have gradually developed enthusiasm for these skiing events,” said Ngawang Tashi.  What’s particularly exciting was that Tsering Dradul and Yongqing Lhamo finally qualified for Beijing 2022 and became the first Tibetan athletes to compete at Winter Olympics, Ngawang Tashi added.  These brilliant achievements couldn’t have been made without the mountaineering team’s talent cultivation system that has matured considerably over the past years.  The mountaineering guide school located in the northern suburbs of Lhasa, capital of Tibet, is the only mountaineering school in China and the second one of its kind in the world. Students there are mainly teenagers of the Tibetan ethnic group who are interested in skiing and mountaineering. They are provided with systematic and professional training in the school.    Photo shows Mount Namjagbarwa in Nyingchi, southwest China’s Tibet autonomous region. (People’s Daily Online/Wang Tianhao)  So far, the school has cultivated more than 300 mountaineering professionals including mountain guides, continuously supplying reserve forces to the China Tibet Mountaineering Team and the industry of high-altitude mountaineering.  In an effort to bring mountaineering closer to the public, the China Tibet Mountaineering Team has actively promoted the Tibet mountaineering conference, which has been held for 20 consecutive sessions and attracted many mountaineering enthusiasts to climbing snow-capped mountains in Tibet.  The event includes not only splendid skiing and mountaineering competitions, but mountaineering training, ice and snow sports-themed cultural exhibition, and other activities, playing an important role in boosting the integrated development of mountaineering, sports industry and tourism sector.  Based on its rich reserve of professional mountaineers, the China Tibet Mountaineering Team has actively engaged in mountain rescue, and taken part in more than 30 major rescue tasks, including the evacuation of mountaineers after a devastating earthquake hit Nepal in 2015. In the climbing season every year, the mountaineering team clears mountain areas of household waste and disposes of it.  “We’ve got to protect the lofty mountains, blue skies, and white clouds of the snow-covered Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,” Sonam noted.  Looking forward, the China Tibet Mountaineering Team is making active efforts to adapt to changes and make progress in key priorities of its work, including mountaineering industrialization, regular environmental protection activities in mountains, and scientific development of mountain rescue.

Thanks to the promotion of banking institutions, internet companies, and retail terminals, digital yuan now can be used in a wider range of scenarios.  *China has stepped up efforts to promote the digital yuan with pilot programs. Since 2017, the country has tested the use of the digital yuan in over 10 places from Shenzhen to Shanghai and Xiong'an New Area.  *China's digital yuan transactions hit nearly 87.57 billion yuan at the end of 2021, as the country ramped up research and pilot use of the central bank's digital currency.  GUANGZHOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- In the Canton Tower located in Haizhu District, a landmark of the southern Chinese metropolis of Guangzhou, Zhang Ling, a shopper from southwest China's Sichuan Province, bought a souvenir. Unlike her usual transactions, this time she chose to pay in digital yuan, China's digital fiat currency, or the e-CNY.  "I feel it is very convenient as it took me less than one minute to download the application and register an account," said Zhang. "There are also some discounts available now, so I'm willing to try the digital yuan."  Like Zhang, many Chinese people are embracing the digital yuan with a positive attitude. Thanks to the promotion of banking institutions, internet companies, and retail terminals, digital yuan now can be used in a wider range of scenarios.    Undated photo shows a customer paying in digital yuan (e-CNY) at a retail store in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province. (Xinhua)  MORE CONVENIENT  China has stepped up efforts to promote the digital yuan with pilot programs. Since 2017, the country has tested the use of the digital yuan in over 10 places from Shenzhen to Shanghai and Xiong'an New Area.  The use of digital yuan is similar to that of WeChat Pay and Alipay, which are popular online payment apps in China. With QR code or Near Field Communication (NFC) techniques, the payment can be completed easily on mobile terminals of both shoppers and merchants. What makes digital yuan different is that it can still be used without a network.  Tourists could pay in digital yuan at ticket windows, merchandise stores and restaurants from April 15, according to Liu Yiying, a finance manager of the management branch under Canton Tower Cultural Tourism Development Co., Ltd.  "We launched preferential activities for digital yuan after the May Day holiday, which has attracted an increasing number of tourists," said Liu.  In the tramline in Guangzhou's Haizhu District, the upgraded checking machines in passenger cars and stations also support digital yuan payment.  Since the digital yuan payment was launched in April, hundreds of payments have been made cumulatively, with nearly 100 orders a day at most, according to Su Jun, deputy general manager of Guangzhou Tram.  "From the perspective of enterprises' financial management, digital yuan improves the efficiency as the money paid by consumers can be transferred to our account in real time," said Su.

(Xinhua/Wu Wei)  MORE INSTITUTIONS COVERED  The pilot version of the digital yuan app was released on major Android app stores and Apple's App Store on Jan 4. Currently, the designated operators of digital yuan cover major Chinese banks, such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank, and online banks.  "We promote discount campaigns for people using the digital yuan in supermarkets such as Guangzhou Grandbuy and Guangzhou Friendship Store, which can effectively stimulate the enthusiasm of consumers," said an official with the Guangzhou branch of ICBC. "The merchants are also free of service charge at the same time."  Many internet platforms that gather rich consumption scenes are also opening up to embrace the digital currency, such as JD.COM, Tencent, Meituan and Bilibili.  By the end of 2021, there were more than 8 million applicable scenarios of digital yuan in the pilot areas via WeChat, a social software developed by Tencent. The company said it has deeply participated in the design, research, development and operation of the digital currency since 2018.  According to data from Meituan, more than 5 million sub-wallets of digital currency were pushed to the Meituan App, and more than 4 million users spent digital yuan on Meituan from last September to early May.  Several banks in south China's metropolis of Shenzhen are to cooperate with Meituan to distribute red packets of digital yuan worth 30 million yuan (about 4.42 million U.S. dollars).  "The pilot project of Meituan is a beneficial attempt to advocate simple, moderate, green and low-carbon life through digital currency," said Cao Heping, a professor at the School of Economics of Peking University.

(Photo by Luo Ling/Xinhua)  MORE CITIES INVOLVED  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced in early April that the pilot program would be expanded to more domestic cities, including Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen and six cities in east China's Zhejiang Province hosting the 19th Asian Games, following its successful operation over the past years.  Beijing and Zhangjiakou were also included in the program after tests in the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.  A number of application modes have taken shape in wholesale and retail, catering, tourism and payment of administrative fees, which cover both online and offline scenarios and can be replicated and promoted. The scale of users, merchants and transactions in the pilot areas has grown steadily.  Guangzhou, as one of the pilot cities, has innovatively implemented new application scenarios such as granting talent subsidies and paying parallel imported cars with digital yuan and promoted the use of digital yuan in various scenarios such as transportation, supermarkets in business circles, tourism and online consumption platforms.  China's digital yuan transactions hit nearly 87.57 billion yuan at the end of 2021, as the country ramped up research and pilot use of the central bank's digital currency.  A total of 261 million personal wallets for the digital yuan had been opened, and the number of pilot scenarios had exceeded 8.08 million, said Zou Lan, an official with the PBOC.  Zou said the central bank would continue promoting research and development of the digital fiat currency and further deepen the pilot use of e-CNY in retail services, government services, and other scenarios.

This is the third consecutive month of decline for the gauge, which is lower than that of the same period last year, said the China Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.  Halted production due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, coupled with industry chain disruptions and high commodity prices, has made it more difficult for some companies to cover costs, said the association.  The sub-indexes for industry, construction, transportation and postal services, wholesale and retail, as well as hospitality and catering retreated from a month ago, while that for real estate increased.  The industry group calls for targeted support to virus-hit small businesses in the service sector, implementation of policies like tax and fee cuts, as well as efforts to keep prices and employment stable.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The West Texas Intermediate for June delivery added 4.36 U.S. dollars, or 4.1 percent, to settle at 110.49 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude for July delivery increased 4.1 dollars, or 3.8 percent, to close at 111.55 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange.  The rally came despite data released Friday by Houston-based oilfield services company Baker Hughes showing that the number of total active drilling rigs in the United States rose by nine to 714 this week.  Oil rigs in the United States rose by six to 563 this week , gas rigs rose by three to 149, and miscellaneous rigs stayed unchanged at two, showed the data.  Concerns over supply risks lingered as the European Union (EU) worked on gaining support for an oil embargo against Russia.  Last week, the EU unveiled a plan to phase out Russian crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of the year, as part of its sixth sanction package aimed against Moscow.  Hungary and other Eastern European countries, whose economies are largely reliant on Russian oil, are not ready yet to accept the sanction package in its current form.  Traders also weighed risks to the demand side.  In its monthly report released on Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries revised down its forecast for world oil demand growth in 2022, citing impacts from geopolitical tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the week, the U.S. crude standard rose 0.7 percent, while Brent declined 0.7 percent, based on the front-month contracts.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Large retail companies in Shanghai have started to reopen their supermarkets amid the recent COVID-19 resurgence. (Xinhua/Chen Jianli)  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has exerted downward pressure on the Chinese economy. With an array of pro-growth policies to produce their intended effects, the risk is manageable and the sound fundamentals of the world's second-largest economy in the medium-to-long term will not change.  To cope with the pandemic, China has applied a stringent dynamic zero-COVID policy. As the pandemic is still raging across the world and coronavirus continues to mutate, there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning how the situation will develop. The country has warned against any slackening in its efforts to control the virus.  China's stance has been firm and clear -- unswervingly adhering to the dynamic zero-COVID policy while shoring up the economy and ensuring people's lives are affected as little as possible.  Giving proper consideration to all these aspects is a difficult task. The earnest implementation of this policy is a major test for all regions and departments.  A string of pro-growth policies is in the pipeline. China has already adopted multi-pronged fiscal measures in tax and fee cuts, public budget expenditure and bond issuance to stabilize the economy and ensure its people's wellbeing.  Moreover, China has accelerated the establishment of a unified domestic market, comprehensively strengthened infrastructure construction, and deepened reform and opening-up across the board.  The State Council and relevant departments are also rolling out detailed policies and measures to help industries, individually owned businesses and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises hit hard by the pandemic, and to stabilize market entities.

(Xinhua/Zhang Jiansong)  Chinese authorities have ample space and diversified tools for fiscal, monetary and other policies. They have rich experience in responding to downward pressure on the economy and will further strengthen regulatory control, and will do so when the time is right.  The Chinese economy is off to a steady start this year, with its GDP up 4.8 percent year on year in the first three months. Despite the downward pressure, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, including its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. After pro-growth policies gradually produce their intended effects, China's economic performance will improve.  By contributing approximately 30 percent to world economic growth, the Chinese economy is the largest engine driving global economic growth. The Chinese economy is at a critical moment in overcoming its difficulties. It is only by remaining confident and rising to the challenges that China can turn adverse situations into opportunities, embrace its bright prospects, continue to inject dynamism into the stability and recovery of the global economy and bring broader market opportunities for all countries.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Fan Jiashan/People’s Daily Online)  China’s services trade has maintained fast growth. Data from the country’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) showed that China’s imports and exports of services totaled over 1.45 trillion yuan ($214.6 billion) in the first quarter of 2022, rising 25.8 percent year on year.  Its exports of services grew 30.8 percent to 713.98 billion yuan and imports of services reached 743.01 billion yuan with a year-on-year increase of 21.3 percent. The growth of services exports outpaced import growth by 9.5 percentage points, resulting in a 56.4-percent drop in the country’s services trade deficit to 29.03 billion yuan from the same period last year.  Zhao Zhonghui, director of the translation center of BERIS Engineering and Research Corporation in Qingdao city, east China’s Shandong province, has been busy dubbing a program of Shandong TV into Lao with her colleagues.  “This is a new service export project we launched this year. We’ve so far finished translating the Chinese subtitles into Lao, English and Romanian, and basically accomplished the dubbing work,” said Zhao, adding that the program will be aired on Lao National Television and Romanian public television TVR in a few days.  According to Zhao, the company completed the multilingual dubbing and subtitle translation of more than 10,000 standard episodes of TV programs in 2021. The programs it exported last year, which were 450,000 minutes in total length, have been broadcast on TV stations and online video platforms in 195 countries and regions and received over 10 billion hits globally, bringing the company an export value of several billion yuan.

(Photo by Fan Jiashan/People’s Daily Online)  During the rapid development of trade in services, knowledge-intensive service industry, as a key field, made remarkable progress and showed stronger export competitiveness, noted Zhang Jianping, head of the Center for Regional Economic Cooperation under the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.  China’s trade in knowledge-intensive services climbed 14.1 percent to 615.66 billion yuan in the first quarter of the year, according to an official with the Department of Trade in Services and Commercial Services of the MOFCOM.  Knowledge-intensive services exports expanded 16.3 percent to 350.06 billion yuan, among which exports of such fields as telecommunications, computer and information services, other business services, as well as intellectual property royalties registered fast growth, rising 22.1 percent, 14.6 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively.  Imports of knowledge-intensive services grew 11.4 percent to 265.6 billion yuan during the period.    A busy container terminal of Haikou Port, south China’s Hainan province, August 29, 2021.  The sound performance of China’s trade in services is attributed to Chinese enterprises’ increasing competitiveness and the government’s policies and measures.  On August 26, 2021, China officially began to implement a negative list for cross-border trade in services in the southern island province of Hainan. The introduction and implementation of the negative list represented a major breakthrough in the management model of trade in services and signaled further opening-up in cross-border trade in services.  An MOFCOM official recently disclosed that the country plans to formulate a negative list for cross-border trade in services that is applicable to all of its 21 pilot free trade zones (FTZs) this year, and will promote the introduction of a national negative list for cross-border services trade in due course.  In March, the general office of the MOFCOM issued a circular on making good use of the guidance funds for the innovative development of services trade to support the development of new trade forms and models, encouraging leveraging new ways of financing to stimulate new trade forms and models.  The MOFCOM and six other government departments lately approved a new batch of 40 specialized bases for featured services export. China is now home to 112 bases for featured services export, which cover seven fields including culture, traditional Chinese medicine, digital services, human resources, geographic information, intellectual property and language services.  The 2022 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), which is scheduled to be held both online and offline in September, will focus on trends in services trade, highlight digitalization and green development, and add a thematic exhibition of environment services.  Six kinds of activities will be held during this year’s CIFTIS, including the Global Trade in Services Summit, exhibition, conference and forum, promotion and negotiation, achievement release as well as supporting activities.  The exhibition will cover an area of no less than 126,000 square meters, and over 100 conferences, forums, promotion and negotiation activities will be held.  As an important part of international trade and a major field of international economic and trade cooperation, services trade plays a key role in building a new development pattern.  Last year, the value added of China’s service sector accounted for 53.3 percent of the country’s GDP, and the country’s total trade in services reached 5.3 trillion yuan, ranking second in the world for eight consecutive years.  On the whole, China’s trade in services is characterized by constantly expanding scale, steadily increasing added value and continuously growing competitiveness, and still has huge potential for growth and great market opportunities.

(Photo/Xinhua)  China will continue to maintain steady economic growth and remain steadfast in its pursuit of high-quality development, despite some current difficulties and challenges, said Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of the National Bureau of Statistics in an interview.  Although the recent COVID-19 epidemic situation in the country has weighed on its economy, giving rise to slight contractions in certain economic indicators, China’s economy still enjoys strong potential and great resilience, with fundamentals underpinning the economy’s stable development and sound momentum remaining unchanged, according to Sheng.  Regions hit hard by COVID-19, such as Shanghai and Jilin Province in northeast China, have gradually brought the epidemic situation under control since the beginning of May, and have begun to resume work and production in an orderly way, evidenced by an increase in their electricity output&nbsp;and power consumption.  “New growth drivers are on the rise and the country will not shift its direction in high-quality development,” Sheng remarked.  Sheng is also optimistic about China’s economic performance throughout the year because the country has a resilient supply chain supported by its growing productive forces, the world’s most&nbsp;promising&nbsp;consumer&nbsp;market with its population of 1.41 billion, as well as various policy instruments to leverage moving forward, and more importantly, it has the marked strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics that the country will draw upon, along with social harmony and stability.  With regards to the main tasks at present, he noted that it is vital to ensure that the economy operates in a reasonable range. China has vowed to adhere unwaveringly to its dynamic zero-COVID policy, and guard against inbound cases and domestic resurgences, in order to consolidate the hard-won results of its prevention and control efforts.  He also highlighted the role of pro-growth policies and giving full play to effective investments. "History has shown that expanding infrastructure investment is the most effective and fastest way out of short-term economic hardship," he said, adding that China still has broad space for infrastructure investment.  “Measures such as tax refunds, tax and fee cuts, the deferral of social security contribution payments, special funds, and inclusive finance lending to micro and small businesses will shore up market entities,” he said.  Besides, he highlighted efforts to stabilize employment, ensure people’s livelihood, and&nbsp;keep supplies and prices stable, particularly in critical areas such as food and energy.  Sheng noted that weakening market expectations is a pressing problem at the moment, with the Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) for China's manufacturing industry and the index for non-manufacturing business activity in April standing at 47.4 percent and 41.9 percent, respectively.  Sheng believes this can be ascribed to increasing uncertainties in the world economy accompanied by higher interest rates, rising costs, high inflation, and sluggish&nbsp;global&nbsp;growth, among other concerns, in addition to geopolitical events such as the Ukraine crisis, as well as certain domestic reasons such as shrinking demand and logistics hindered by recent efforts to control the epidemic.  To cope with these problems, Sheng said that the country needs to maintain a stable macroeconomic performance to accomplish the main targets and tasks for the year,&nbsp;step up efforts to ease the difficulties encountered by market entities, roll out relevant measures at an early date, and continue reforms to improve the business environment for enterprises. He also stressed the continuity, consistency, and sustainability of macro policies.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Li Ziheng)  JINAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province posted a 14.2 percent year-on-year increase in its foreign trade in the first four months of 2022, Qingdao Customs said on Thursday.  The province's total import and export volume exceeded 968.8 billion yuan (144 billion U.S. dollars) during the period. Of the total, exports grew 22.7 percent to around 572.7 billion yuan, while imports increased 3.9 percent to about 396 billion yuan.  Notably, Shandong's private sector reported 19 percent year-on-year growth to over 697 billion yuan, accounting for 72 percent of its total foreign-trade volume.  During the period, Shandong's trade with countries along the Belt and Road also recorded robust growth, up 26.6 percent, with the value reaching 343 billion yuan.  Mechanical and electronic products were among the province's major exports in the first four months, taking up 42 percent of the total export volume, said the local customs authorities.  &nbsp;    Photo taken on May 1, 2022 shows a container vessel docking at the Qianwan Container Terminal in Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province.

As one of Australia's most popular online and offline cosmetic platforms, Mecca houses more than 150 brands. In 2020, Mecca was launched in the Chinese market via the Tmall Global platform, an online marketplace to purchase imported products.  "Aligning with the growing beauty industry in China, we have seen rapid growth over the past two years on the Tmall platform, our followers have increased to over 100,000 members with a total of 34 brands in our portfolio, with plans to continue expanding," Alex Lu, head of MECCA e-Commerce China, told Xinhua in a recent interview.  China has always been committed to a high-standard opening up and welcoming foreign investment. The country remains a hotspot for foreign investors seeking predictable market opportunities at a difficult time amid the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to the country's unremitting efforts to optimize its business environment.  Foreign direct investment into the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 25.6 percent year on year to 379.87 billion yuan (56 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of the year, official data showed.  "Entering the Chinese market has always been one of our goals. China's beauty industry is one of the fastest growing sectors with a highly diverse and digitally savvy customer base, we know that there is an appetite for cosmetics in this market."  Lu added variety has always been Mecca's strength, and as such it was well-positioned to meet the demand of a wide range of Chinese customers who care about quality cosmetics.  "Through a comprehensive understanding of the market, we know that there is huge demand and consumption potential in the China market and paired with MECCA's magic, we could be very competitive," Lu added.  Harnessing the power of Chinese social media, the company has a team in China that livestreams regularly on social platforms to cultivate, brand build, and engage its loyal customer base. Some Chinese influencers will also collaborate with them to highlight various Australian beauty brands, such as its own in-house brand -- Mecca Cosmetica.  "We also get inspired by the purchase models in China and will see if it can be integrated back into our Australian business," said Lu.  "We have conducted several successful livestreams in Australia, and we are exploring options for this to be a more regular occurrence through various social media channels such as WeChat and Instagram."  Lu pointed out some key differences between Australia's and China's e-commerce environment. In China, online marketplaces are wildly popular and Chinese consumers are much more accustomed to making online purchases through a few clicks on their phones.  "However, after years of highly developed online purchasing mechanisms, we have seen a shift in customer sentiment as some consumers may now feel that meeting the endless requirements to redeem promotions is quite cumbersome and tiring, especially during festival promotions on the platform."  "Yet, this will not affect China to be the first or second largest premium beauty market globally," added Lu. "The potential for consumption is still prevalent and it's definitely an attractive market for emerging brands." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Major state-owned banks are expected to increase inclusive loans for micro and small firms by 1.6 trillion yuan (about 237.1 billion U.S. dollars) this year to step up financial support for businesses, according to a State Council executive meeting earlier this month.  The meeting also called on banks to renew loans, extend and adjust repayment arrangements, and waive default interest for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed households as appropriate.  "Currently, small and micro firms are facing challenges and need stronger support from the government and financial institutions," said Liu Xingguo, a researcher with China Enterprise Confederation.  In the first quarter of 2022, outstanding inclusive loans to small and micro firms climbed 22.6 percent year on year, while total new loans issued stood at 8.6 trillion yuan, up 445.5 billion yuan from a year ago, official statistics showed.  "We are using all possible means to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome difficulties, increase their confidence and stabilize their expectations," Xu Xiaolan, vice minister of industry and information technology said Tuesday at a meeting for addressing the difficulties of SMEs.  So far this year, the central government has rolled out 17 policies to support SMEs, while local governments have launched 52 policies with the same goal in mind, noted Xin Guobin, vice minister of industry and information technology.  In COVID-hit Shanghai, financial institutions have issued 33.5 billion yuan of loans to enterprises supplying daily goods and offering logistics services since March, said Yu Wenjian, an official with the Shanghai head office of the People's Bank of China.  The institutions have also issued 72.3 billion yuan of loans to over 10,000 companies in the catering, retail, tourism and transportation sectors, which have all been impacted by the epidemic.  In Beijing, policy funds of no less than 150 billion yuan are expected to be issued to support market entities in 2022, according to the People's Bank of China.  Liang Tao, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, also noted at an interview earlier this month that more attentive and accessible financial services will be extended to hard-hit areas like the city of Shanghai and Jilin Province.  Many of China's financial and fiscal policies have already helped enterprises through these difficult times.  Fuxeon Fire-fighting Technology Co., Ltd., based in the private company hub of Quanzhou in east China's Fujian Province, experienced a COVID-19 resurgence in mid-March that disrupted logistics services and drove up the price of raw materials.  "We were facing great pressure in controlling the cost," said Huang Jiafu, general manager of the company.  He later learned from the local tax department that the company can apply for deferred tax for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter this year.  "Benefiting from this policy, we have enjoyed more than 700,000 yuan of deferred tax amount, which effectively eased our financial strains," Huang said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

China will optimize and expand the connectivity of domestic and overseas capital markets, Wang Jianjun, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told Xinhua in an interview.  The vice chairman said that the commission is expanding the scope of Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect schemes, with efforts to step up the inclusion of exchange-traded funds into the two programs.  To support Chinese firms in getting listed in overseas markets such as Hong Kong and the United States, new rules and regulations will be put into effect. In the same vein, China welcomes qualified international companies to get listed on the mainland stock market.  On top of that, more cross-border investment and risk management products will be provided for overseas investors, the securities regulator said, pledging that it will also build up supervision capacities and enhance cooperation with other countries.  Despite recent volatility in global capital flows, Wang said there are "no fundamental changes in the capital flow and trading of China's capital market."  Since the start of this year, risks arising from geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the monetary policy shifts in major economies have prompted jitters among global investors.  According to data from the Institute of International Finance, foreign capital has been pulling out of the emerging markets in March and April, but China's equities posted about 1 billion U.S. dollars in inflows in April.  What's worth noticing is that long-term funds have also kept flowing to China this year, a signal that foreign investors remain optimistic about the prospects of Chinese stocks and the country's economic growth.  China's listed firms posted steady performance last year, turning in satisfying financial reports to shareholders. According to data from 4,804 listed firms, these companies raked in 66.4 trillion yuan (about 9.87 trillion U.S. dollars) in operating revenue and 5.1 trillion yuan in net profits in 2021, up 19.3 percent and 19.8 percent from a year ago, respectively.  And the market has continued to grow with more players. In 2021, the number of listed firms on the mainland stock market rose by 524 to about 4,700, with their aggregate market capitalization ranking second globally.  Commenting on Chinese A-share market volatilities this year, Wang said that it would not derail China's capital market from its long-term positive development trend.  There were some "overreactions" in the market, Wang said, believing that the influence of these risks is "controllable" and the steady operation of the market is underpinned by solid foundations.  The Chinese economy has sustained its recovering momentum as supply and industrial chains have been gradually unsnarled, Wang said, noting that pro-growth policy mixes have also sent positive signals to several primary sectors and helped anchor market expectations.  In the eyes of Fang Xinghai, also vice chairman of the securities regulator, China's growth potential is yet to be fully unleashed, and the fundamentals of its sound economic development will remain unchanged.  A country's foreign capital attraction capacity depends partly on its opening-up policy and China is pretty clear about the direction and means of its higher-level opening-up, said Fang.  Li Zhan, an economist with Zhongshan Securities, said China should make its capital market more internationalized when rolling out a registration-based initial public offering system.  More policy measures should be introduced to lower the threshold for overseas capital, facilitate cross-border investment and develop international financial products, Li said.

Liu made the remarks while addressing a video conference attended by finance ministers and central bank governors from the ASEAN Plus Three countries.  China will join hands with other member states in promoting innovation and exploring new areas of regional financial cooperation, Liu said.  Efforts should be made to advance the development of the Asian bond market and meet the financing needs of the region's future development, Liu said.  China will continue to effectively coordinate COVID-19 prevention and control with economic and social development, step up its macro-policy adjustment, and implement a proactive fiscal policy while improving its effectiveness.

"There is sufficient room for fiscal, monetary policy and other policies, and we have various policy tools," Han Wenxiu, the official with the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, said at a press conference in response to questions on China's economic development.  "We have rich experience in coping with downward pressure on the economy, and will not hesitate to take steps," Han said.  The official's comments follow the Chinese authorities' recognition of mounting downward pressure on the economy, which was addressed at a key meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in late April.  The meeting analyzed the current economic situation and economic work, including the rising risks caused by the resurgences of COVID-19 and the Ukraine crisis, and clearly asserted that efforts should be made to contain the epidemic, stabilize the economy and keep development secure.  "All those aspects should be taken into account, and you cannot fix just one at a time," Han said. "It is a quite difficult work."  Calling the epidemic "a tiger in the way" of economic and social development, Han called for scientific, precise and effective measures to prevent and control COVID-19, which is an "essential pre-condition for the normal operation of the economy and society."  Efforts should be made to implement the existing policies in the first half of the year, Han said, adding that the State Council and relevant departments are working on detailed policy steps to help industries, small and medium-sized enterprises and individual businesses that are severely affected by the epidemic.  Han also called for making reforms and tapping the potential of domestic demand, such as strengthening infrastructure construction, making effective investment and boosting consumption.  "China's economy is at a critical moment in overcoming difficulties, and the problems are the growing pains in the development process," Han said. "As long as we strengthen our confidence and rise to the challenges, we will be able to turn those challenges into opportunities, and that is the basic logic of China's economic development."  Chen Yulu, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, said that, in order to cushion the impact of the epidemic, the central bank has cut the reserve requirement ratio to keep liquidity at an ample level, lowered the financing costs of market entities, and implemented structural monetary instruments.  China has established a re-lending facility worth 200 billion yuan (about 29.72 billion U.S. dollars) to boost scientific and technological innovation and implemented a re-lending cap of 40 billion yuan for inclusive elderly care, Chen said.  By the end of March, the central bank had issued 138.6 billion yuan of funds through a supporting tool for carbon reduction, he added.  The central bank will put stable growth in a more prominent position, actively plan incremental policy tools, continue to reduce financing costs and step up financial support for the real economy, Chen said.

Meanwhile, relevant government departments will adjust their policies promptly to ease the financial burdens on these businesses.

(People’s Daily Online/Wang Jilin)  Although the country’s economic operation has remained generally stable despite complex domestic and international situation since the beginning of this year, the increasing complexity, severity and uncertainty of the environment for economic development has made it harder to survive for market players, especially MSMEs and self-employed households.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has rolled out more than 20 tax-relief policies this year, including&nbsp;implementing value-added tax (VAT) credit refund on a large scale to fully give back outstanding VAT credits&nbsp;in certain industries; extending tax and fee reduction policies that support manufacturing, micro and small enterprises and self-employed households and expanding the scale and scope of these policies; and introducing tax policies to support the development of industries facing special difficulties caused by COVID-19, according to Xu Hongcai, vice minister of finance.  At present, various policies concerning tax refunds and reductions and fee cuts are being implemented at a faster pace, Xu noted.

(People’s Daily Online/Xu Changliang)  In response to impeded logistics recently, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has identified 1,624 key enterprises in four batches and instructed 17 provinces to establish regional “white lists” for key enterprises, said Xin Guobin, vice minister of the MIIT.  It has also built a coordination platform for key industrial and supply chains involving automobiles, integrated circuits and medical supplies to ensure the smooth operation of key industrial chains, Xin added.  The MIIT will carry out special inspections of the effects of policies aimed at reducing the burden on enterprises and promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to make sure that these policies are effectively implemented, according to Xin.  Besides, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank of China, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) put forward 23 measures covering such aspects as supporting enterprises facing difficulties and promoting foreign trade and export.  The Bank of Communications actively improved its online foreign exchange and treasury business to enable MSMEs engaged in foreign trade to handle foreign exchange business online, thus helping them save the costs generated from seeking offline services and avoid foreign exchange risks.  The effective measures taken by China to help companies survive the difficult times have boosted the confidence of various parties.

(People’s Daily Online/Chen Bin)  China has a mature and resilient supply chain system and is an important global consumer market, which is helpful in promoting the development of SMEs and driving corporate innovation and eventually stimulating greater economic vitality, noted Zhang Xiaolei, president of Standard Chartered Bank (China) Limited.  “In the next three years, we will invest $300 million in China-related businesses to help clients seize the opportunities brought by China’s continuous opening-up,” Zhang said.  According to Pu Chun, deputy head of the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), the number of China’s newly established market entities registered positive growth between January and April, reaching nearly 8.99 million with a year-on-year increase of 0.7 percent.  During the period, an average of 22,600 enterprises were newly established per day, which represent a relatively high level; and over 6.23 million individuals registered as self-employed business owners, up 2.9 percent compared with the same period in 2021.  “Although the Chinese economy has been faced with a complex and grim environment, the number of newly established market entities this year has basically remained stable, which reflected the economy’s strong resilience and potential,” Pu said, adding that the number of market players is expected to maintain rapid growth when the pandemic is effectively controlled and the effects of relevant policies continue to be unleashed.  Although the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has brought difficulties and challenges to many market players, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy—its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability—remain unchanged.  In the future, China’s economy will show stronger dynamism with the continuous implementation of relevant policies. Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

HUA XUEGEN/FOR CHINA DAILY  Foreign enterprises operating in China, a long-term, thriving part of the nation's economy, are expected to continue to expand their investments this year, as many countries worldwide are encountering uncertainties amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, high inflation rates and slowing economic recovery, analysts and business leaders said.  In addition to describing China as a safe haven for foreign direct investment, they said the nation's efforts to create a unified domestic market, its sizable middle-income group and shortened negative lists will enable its economy to mitigate shocks and maintain steady growth momentum.  By building a unified domestic market including all elements of production and resources－capital, technology and energy－China will further remove barriers to the rational flow of production factors, said Bai Ming, deputy director of international market research at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. It will also cut transaction costs and ensure fair competition, which will encourage domestic and foreign companies alike to invest across the country, Bai said.  The nation's strengths in attracting global capital will continue, he added, and business areas including new energy, consumption, high-end manufacturing and services will remain hot spots for multinational investment.  Thanks to the nation's complete industrial chains, policy assistance and stable business environment, FDI flows into the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 14.9 percent year-on-year to a record high of 1.15 trillion yuan ($170.43 billion) in 2021, according to the Ministry of Commerce.  Apart from opening new stores in smaller cities and adding investment in apparel and children's products in the coming years throughout China, Skechers, a United States-based athletic-leisure shoe and clothing company, will start to build the second phase of its Taicang logistics center in Jiangsu province and begin operations at its new China headquarters in Shanghai in the second half.  "We are confident about the Chinese market," said Willie Tan, CEO of Skechers China, South Korea and Southeast Asia. The company will continue to strengthen its diversified product layouts for all age groups to meet the needs of different consumers, as China has become the cradle of fostering "numerous new consumption scenarios, products and services regarding the sports and health industry", Tan said.  Vivian Tu, marketing leader of Philips Domestic Appliances Greater China, said that the home appliances sector, spurred somewhat by work-from-home trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic, will have the potential to grow stronger than before and see new opportunities in China, as consumer demand has become more diversified and personalized.  "We will enlarge the research team in our innovation center in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, to focus on advanced technologies such as robotics, the internet of things and artificial intelligence over the next five years. It will create new momentum for the home appliances industry with the development of digitalization and intelligence," Tu said.  Bai Wenxi, chief economist at IP Global China, said that China, facing fierce competition in Southeast Asia in labor-intensive manufacturing sectors, has upgraded the competitiveness of its industrial chains. Its ability to attract global capital has been further strengthened by the expansion of opening-up policies and the implementation of equal treatment for foreign-funded enterprises.  Rajat Agarwal, president of Henkel China, a German chemical and consumer goods manufacturer, said: "Looking ahead, China will continue its transformation toward high-quality growth and drive progress to reach its dual-carbon goals. We see strong future demand in the areas of packaged foods, home improvement, automotive and electronics, and Henkel will continue to support our customers and consumers with impactful innovations."  Henkel resumed production in Changchun, Jilin province, on April 15, manufacturing products for key industries including metals, automotive and railway transportation. Its two plants in Shanghai were included in the "white list" to restart production under closed-loop management, and plan to expand production capacity as conditions allow.

WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- As inflation hovers near a 40-year high, U.S. trade groups and economists have been urging the Biden administration to scrap Trump-era additional tariffs on Chinese imports, regarding such tariffs as counterproductive to the U.S. economy.  These tariffs, with no good policy purpose, were an unnecessary tax on U.S. consumers and businesses, they said, noting that eliminating or at least reducing them would help lower elevated inflation and stabilize inflation expectations.  But with the mid-term elections coming up, some lawmakers, who are keen to take a tough stance toward China, might be reluctant to support the easing of China tariffs, refraining from doing the "right thing" for American businesses and people.

(Xinhua/Liu Jie)  ELEVATED INFLATION, ELEVATED PRESSURE  Several White House officials, as well as President Joe Biden himself, have signaled that the administration is weighing whether to dismantle at least some of former President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.  "We're discussing that right now. We're looking at what would have the most positive impact," Biden told reporters after a speech on inflation Tuesday, noting that no decision has been made.  Biden's remarks followed recent statements by Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who spoke about potential easing of tariffs on Chinese products in late April.  Republican Senator Mike Crapo also called for "thoughtful application" of the Section 301 tariffs on China. "We need to cut tariffs on inputs that support American manufacturing, or on goods consumed by the American consumer, especially middle and low income families," he said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing.  Such voices came as the United States is experiencing the highest inflation in four decades, with the consumer price index (CPI) staying over 6 percent year-on-year since October last year. According to the Labor Department's data released Wednesday, CPI in April surged by 8.3 percent from a year ago, marking the second straight month of inflation over 8 percent.  Although price growth showed signs of easing in April, the latest CPI data "served as a stark reminder" that the Federal Reserve has a long road ahead of it in bringing down inflation," Sarah House and Michael Pugliese, economists at the Wells Fargo Securities, said in an analysis.    A woman walks past a store in New York, the United States, May 11, 2022. U.S. consumer inflation in April surged by 8.3 percent from a year ago. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)  "Americans are unhappy about rising inflation and costs, so providing tariff relief soon is one way to lower prices and increase demand, especially for consumer goods," the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC), which represents 260 American companies that do business with China, told Xinhua on Wednesday.  The trade group said earlier that there is "no reason" to maintain the additional tariffs on Chinese products imposed during Trump's presidency, as they were an "unnecessary tax" on U.S. consumers and businesses "for no good policy purpose."  Americans for Free Trade, a broad coalition of trade organizations, recently warned that the Section 301 tariffs create "additional economic burden" for American businesses, manufacturers, farmers, and families, make the United States less competitive globally and cause "disproportionate economic harm to an American economy grappling with ongoing inflation concerns."  Not only hurting U.S. businesses and workers, tariffs also drive up prices, and inflation expectations are starting to rise, according to an Axios report entitled "Trump's trade war on China was a failure in every possible way."  LOWER TARIFFS, LOWER PRICES  As Americans continue to feel the sting of soaring inflation, economists said eliminating or at least reducing additional tariffs on Chinese goods would help lower elevated inflation and stabilize inflation expectations.  In a recent research, Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), and his colleagues Megan Hogan and Yilin Wang argued that the direct effect of eliminating additional tariffs on Chinese products would be a 0.3 percentage point reduction in CPI, but there would also be an indirect effect, which will add "substantially" to the 0.3 percentage point.  "It would be a pretty big signal to U.S. firms that they are going to face more competition and that might cause them to moderate their price increases as inflation rolls forward," said Hufbauer, also a former U.S. Treasury official.    Photo taken on April 20, 2022 shows the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)  In reaction to the argument that reducing the China tariffs would not lead to a meaningful reduction in prices, Hufbauer said it doesn't completely eliminate the inflation problem, "but it's better than doing nothing."  "So there's raising interest rates, there's cutting back federal spending, there's reducing tariffs, all of those things have some impact," he said. Against the backdrop of a red-hot economy, "every little bit counts."  The PIIE study showed that "a feasible trade liberalization package" could deliver a one-time reduction in CPI inflation of around 1.3 percentage points. That would save 797 dollars for every U.S. household.  In the view of Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, this inflation reduction through tariff removal is "more significant" than anything that can be achieved over the next two to three years through antitrust action, and it is probably much "more important" than the meat packing price fixation, which has been the subject of several presidential events.  Even Yellen said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that removing Trump-era China tariffs would have some "desirable" effects on inflation and "it's worth considering."  RIGHT WING OR RIGHT THING?  Despite encouraging signals on tariff reduction, some lawmakers, who crave an edge in the November mid-term elections, might be reluctant to ease China tariffs, according to observers.  "The midterms are very unlikely to result in any relaxation of the various tensions between U.S. and China, including tariff legislation," Greg Cusack, a former member of the Iowa House of Representatives, told Xinhua.  "Candidates being fielded by the Republicans are even more right-wing and extreme than the current congressional membership, and Democratic candidates across the board will be fighting an uphill battle in which they cannot afford to be seen as 'weak' or as in any way 'caving to China'," said Cusack, a longtime Democrat.  "Congress does not have a lot of incentive to do the 'right thing' unless it is likely to boost their poll standing or bring in more campaign funds," he noted.  Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who, according to the Washington Post, "tries to grab the mantle of right-wing populism," recently tweeted that now is "not the time to go soft on China."    Customers shop at a store in New York, the United States, May 11, 2022. U.S. consumer inflation in April surged by 8.3 percent from a year ago. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)  "Enriching China &amp;woke multinational corporations on the backs of American workers is a failed policy favored by the globalists. Put American workers first," said the Republican Party's rising star.  Leaving his comment below, a Twitter user said: "It is literally causing inflation. You complain about inflation. And you complain when they try to alleviate inflation. Just say that you don't have a value system. You want to say no."  "We need to put what is best for our country, not a political party. Stop playing games," wrote another user.  It's not just Republicans who want to play the China card. Democratic congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio claimed that lifting tariffs on "non-strategic" goods from China would be a major mistake, blaming China for U.S. workers' economic woes.  Under the current political environment, Hufbauer said the Biden administration could be reluctant to remove the Trump-era tariffs, because it would have to face criticism for being "soft" on China.  "They're worried about that, and that prevents them from doing the right thing, the right thing for the U.S. economy," Hufbauer said.  The trade expert reckoned that the House of Representatives and the Senate might be able to reach an agreement on the America COMPETES Act, which could include billions of dollars funding for the semiconductor industry, and expanded tariff exclusion for Chinese products.  There is a better than 50 percent chance that lawmakers could iron out disagreement by summer and provide a series of individually small, but collectively significant tariff exclusion, said Hufbauer.  Chen Fengying, a researcher at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told Xinhua that since 2018, the trade war has escalated step by step, causing harm to both sides.  Noting that the trade war in the context of globalization will only exacerbate inflation in the United States, the scholar said canceling relevant tariffs is conducive to alleviating U.S. economic problems.

(Xinhua/Fang Zhe)  BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite mounting domestic and external uncertainties, China's economy continues to progress with a sound momentum, an official told Xinhua in an interview.  "Although some indicators saw short-term contractions mainly due to the COVID-19 blow, the fundamentals underpinning the economy's stable development and sound momentum remain unchanged," said Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of the National Bureau of Statistics.  In particular, the country's general trend toward economic upgrading and high-quality development has not changed, he said.  China's economy got off to a steady start in the first quarter of this year, with its GDP growing 4.8 percent year on year, accelerating from a 4 percent increase in the fourth quarter last year.  However, shrinking demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations have weighed on the economy since March. Sheng said that leveraging multi-pronged macro policies is the key to reducing the COVID-19 impact to the minimum and ensuring the economy operates in a reasonable range.  The country has vowed to adhere unwaveringly to its dynamic zero-COVID policy to consolidate the hard-won results of prevention and control work, Sheng said.  He also stressed ramping up pro-growth policies and giving full play to effective investment. "History has shown that expanding infrastructure investment is the most effective and fastest way out of short-term economic hardship," he said.  China's amount of infrastructure per capita is only 20 percent to 30 percent of that of developed countries, and its per capita railway operating length is less than 30 percent of the figure for the United States, showing great potential for infrastructure investment, Sheng said.  He also mentioned measures including tax and fee cuts, the deferral of social security contribution payments and the issuance of inclusive loans to shore up market entities.  Noting the increasing COVID-induced pressure on the job market, Sheng highlighted the importance of the full and thorough implementation of pro-employment policies.  "With policies to coordinate pandemic control with economic and social development taking effect, the COVID-19 impact is expected to subdue gradually," Sheng said, citing positive signals already seen in power generation and consumption data.  Efforts should also be made to ensure stable supplies and prices, he said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo/Liu Qing)  ③An international freight train that runs via the China-Laos Railway departs from a railway station in Shenyang, capital city of northeast China’s Liaoning Province. (Photo/People’s Daily)  China’s foreign trade sustained resilience and growth momentum in the first three months of this year despite increasingly complex challenges and risks.  The country’s total imports and exports expanded 7.9 percent year-on-year to reach 12.58 trillion yuan (about $1.88 trillion) in the January-March period, according to official data.  The resilience of China’s foreign trade can be attributed to the efforts of businesses and a slew of policies to help enterprises tide over ongoing difficulties.  Some enterprises engaging in foreign trade have promoted the better integration of the domestic and international markets and greater complementarity between domestic and global resources, improving their competitiveness in global industrial and supply chains.  Recently, TCL China Star Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. (TCL CSOT), a world-leading panel supplier under Chinese consumer electronics company TCL Corp in Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong Province, exported its products to TCL’s plant in Mexico.  In the past, TCL directly exported TV sets. Nowadays the company ships liquid crystal display panels and electronic parts and components to its production base in Mexico, where TV sets are assembled, in this way reducing costs. The approach has played a key role in improving the competitiveness of TCL products in North America.  “Ten years ago, we were hindered by the short supply of screens. But we have mastered core technologies to produce major parts and components such as screens,” said Zhao Jun, chief operating officer of TCL CSOT.  It’s estimated that China’s large-size liquid crystal display panels will reach or exceed 70 percent of the global market by 2023.  In the first two months of this year, TCL’s exports reached $2.77 billion, up 2.2 percent year-on-year. In the first quarter of this year, TCL CSOT exported 12 million TV screens. TCL’s plant in Mexico can produce and assemble modules and inner wiring.  “TCL’s revenue growth in overseas markets is facilitated by the building of complete industrial and supply chains across the globe,” said Li Dongsheng, founder and president of TCL. Li added that building complete industrial and supply chains globally can effectively boost enterprises’ exports of core components, materials and equipment while significantly increasing their global competitiveness.  Meanwhile, new business forms and models of foreign trade such as cross-border e-commerce, overseas warehouses, and the market purchase trade are thriving in China, becoming new drivers for the high-quality development of the country’s foreign trade.  Hangzhou Santa Technology Co., Ltd., a company based in Hangzhou, capital city of east China’s Zhejiang Province, saw its overseas sales of electric bicycles grow by 15 percent in a half year.  “Overseas customers can try our bikes at sales outlets before buying, and after-sales services can be guaranteed,” said Zhu Guoqiang, general manager of the company, attributing this to the establishment of an overseas warehouse.  To explore overseas markets, Santa Technology once rented warehouses outside China, but high rental costs and inconvenient communications made it difficult for the company to achieve its desired results.  Zhejiang Cathy International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd., an international freight forwarder in the city, extended an olive branch to Zhu, inviting him to join its overseas warehouse in Los Angeles, the U.S., where products can be displayed at a 200-square meter operation and service center and professionals are able to provide after-sales services.  Zhu introduced that the overseas warehouse has helped his company save on costs adding up to more than $1 million every year.  The international freight forwarder has so far built 16 self-operated overseas warehouses with a combined area of more than 100,000 square meters.  Ma Shuzhong, director of the International Business Institute at Zhejiang University, said digital and intelligent overseas warehouses can solve the bottleneck problems in cross-border logistics and after-sales services to a greater extent, while helping cross-border enterprises operate at a lower cost, promoting high-quality operations, improving logistics efficiency and providing customers a better shopping experience, thus enhancing the resilience of China’s foreign trade.  At present, Zhejiang has built 791 overseas warehouses covering a total area of 9.5 million square meters in over 40 countries and regions.  Besides, China has continued to deepen multilateral, bilateral, and regional cooperation and promote high-quality development through the Belt and Road Initiative, creating favorable conditions for exporters to explore emerging markets.  China has implemented the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, the world’s largest free trade agreement, bringing new opportunities for enterprises to explore new markets.  Data from the Guangdong branch of the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) showed that the total trade volume of Guangdong with RCEP members reached 343.89 billion yuan, up 2.7 percent year-on-year, in the first two months of this year. The RCEP has improved customs clearance efficiency and cut tariffs, serving as a key fulcrum for stabilizing foreign trade.  China will continue to improve the business environment for foreign trade and make customs clearance for returning export goods more efficient, according to the State Council executive meeting held on April 13.  To help ease difficulties facing foreign trade firms and promote stable growth, all localities and government departments have rolled out a slew of measures to stabilize the overall performance of foreign trade and support exporters in optimizing their structure and building brands to further raise the added value of their products and improve their international competitiveness.

"China is the world's largest manufacturer with the most comprehensive and resilient supply chain system, which has helped China's economy recover rapidly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic," Jerry Zhang, chief executive officer of Standard Chartered Bank (China), told Xinhua in a recent written interview.  "China is also the second-largest consumer market in the world, with huge consumer demands that will continue to foster growth of SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), accelerate innovations, and bring even more vigour to China's economy," she added.  In 2021, the bank's business in China has grown significantly, driven by wealth management, financial markets, trade and unsecured products, according to Zhang.  "The bank is very optimistic about China's long-term development prospects and will continue its investment in China," she said, noting that Standard Chartered Group in February announced it will invest 300 million U.S. dollars into China related business in the next three years, "so as to help our clients seize the opportunities arising from China's continuous reform and opening-up."  China's GDP grew 4.8 percent year on year in the first quarter, which, Zhang said, is "better than market consensus," despite the resurgence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  "This is a good achievement, benefiting from the economic performance and front-loading macro policy support in the first two months," she added.  "The impact of the epidemic and global geopolitical risks may continue in the short term, but we think the fundamentals of a resilient, high-potential and prosperous economy in China remain intact," Zhang told Xinhua.  "We are very confident about the long-term development prospect of China," she added.  Noting China's unwavering efforts to promote high-quality development and deepen reform and opening-up, in particular financial opening-up at a higher level, she said these efforts "will continue to provide enormous development opportunities for international financial institutions including Standard Chartered Bank."  Speaking of China's policies and measures in such fields as opening-up, common prosperity, innovation and green transformation, Zhang said, "China's great efforts to continuously open up its financial sector, as well as achievement in this regard, is well recognized."  "In the past two years, the outbreak of COVID-19 has brought severe challenges to the world economy. In the meantime, China achieved GDP growth of 2.3 percent and 8.1 percent in 2020 and 2021 respectively, contributing significantly to the global anti-epidemic efforts and the recovery of the world economy," she said.  Amid rising risks of stagflation worldwide, Zhang said, "the stable economic growth in China would continue to play an important role for the recovery and growth of the world economy."

With the epidemic situation gradually easing in Shanghai, major enterprises in the eastern Chinese metropolis have resumed stable production, as key industrial chains, such as automobiles, integrated circuits and biomedicine, continued to recover and ramp up production capacity.  All four factories of the U.S. manufacturing company 3M in Shanghai had resumed production by Saturday, the company said, adding that it will continue to improve its production capacity.  Since the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in March in Shanghai, 3M has not suspended its East China Distribution Center and the production of medical protective masks at its Caohejing base to ensure the stable supply of anti-epidemic materials, the company said.  "Now, 3M is gathering the strength of the entire company to actively deploy resources, so as to ensure the closed-loop production of epidemic prevention supplies," said Ding Hongyu, president of 3M China.  On Wednesday, a ship carrying 4,767 electric cars produced by U.S. automaker Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory left a Shanghai port for Slovenia, according to Shanghai customs.  It marked the first export shipment of Tesla cars from Shanghai since the company resumed production on April 19 after a hiatus of over 20 days amid the epidemic.  The company said its Shanghai factory has already started manufacturing vehicles for export to the Asia-Pacific and European markets.  "We believe that the epidemic situation is only a short test and challenge. We have seen the capacity of all sectors to cope with the challenges in the process of resuming work," said Tao Lin, vice president of Tesla. "We believe that production will soon return to normal."  According to a press conference held on May 5, over 70 percent of Shanghai's 1,800-plus major enterprises had resumed work and production.  Earlier this year, the southern city of Shenzhen, a tech hub and a major foreign-trade center in China, also saw a resurgence of COVID-19 infections.  The city took a series of measures, such as suspending public transportation and closing some businesses, from March 14 to 20, and successfully brought the epidemic situation under control. Thanks to the effective actions, businesses gradually resumed normal work and operation starting late March.  Sources with the on-demand delivery service provider Lalamove, known as Huolala in Chinese, said the company saw an obvious drop in the number of orders it received in Shenzhen from March 14 to 21.  However, the number of overall orders handled by the company in the city from March 1 to April 20 was almost equal to the same period last year, with 6,037 new drivers from Shenzhen joining the platform during this period.  During the first quarter, the total number of commercial entities in Shenzhen reached more than 3.85 million, with 88,065 newly registered ones. Over 90 percent of the newly-registered commercial entities are from the tertiary industry, according to the local government.  The city's electricity consumption came in at more than 8.3 billion kWh in April, a year-on-year growth of 0.1 percent and month-on-month growth of 8.8 percent, said the Shenzhen branch of the China Southern Power Grid.  The automobile manufacturing industry has been a main driving force for power consumption, showing an increase of 80 percent in April compared to the same period in the previous year. The electricity consumption of information-related services rose 8.5 percent year on year in April.  The northeastern province of Jilin, where over 60,000 cases were reported in the latest outbreak, cut off all COVID-19 transmission chains in communities by April 14. The provincial capital Changchun announced on May 1 that it has cleared all medium and high-risk areas for COVID-19.  Leading Chinese automaker FAW Group Co., Ltd. began work resumption on April 13 after a month-long suspension. Workers in its five main engine plants in Changchun are working in shifts while some production lines are operating at full capacity.  The company's daily output of complete vehicles has exceeded 4,000 units, and the capacity utilization rate of its factories in Changchun has recovered to 75 percent.  Li Risheng, a FAW employee, said many of his colleagues voluntarily gave up their holidays since the work resumption. "Everybody hopes to speed up the production to recover the losses incurred by the epidemic," he said.  All major express delivery firms including China Postal Express &amp; Logistics, JD.com and SF Express, have seen their distribution centers in Changchun resuming work from April 24.

China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 2.1 percent year on year in April, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Wednesday. (Photo by Xue Yingying/Xinhua)  BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's inflation has remained at an overall moderate and controllable level, with consumer prices seeing a mild uptick in April and factory prices facing cost pressure, official data showed on Wednesday.  The consumer price index (CPI), the main gauge of inflation, rose 2.1 percent year on year in April, and went up 0.4 percent from the previous month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).  The rise were partly due to the domestic resurgence of COVID-19 and the continuous rise of bulk commodity prices across the globe, noted Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician with the NBS.  Food prices went up 0.9 percent from the previous month, driving up the monthly consumer inflation by about 0.17 percentage points.  Specifically, the price of pork, a staple meat in China, increased 1.5 percent month-on-month in April, compared with a 9.3 percent decrease in March. Hog production has gradually tempered and stockpiling of pork to replenish state reserves is in progress, Dong said.  Pork prices still registered a year-on-year drop of 33.3 percent, narrowing by 8.1 percentage points from the previous month.  Non-food prices rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier, the same growth recorded the previous month. The prices of gasoline, diesel and liquified petroleum gas went up by 29 percent, 31.7 percent and 26.9 percent year on year, respectively.  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, gained 0.9 percent year on year in April, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.  Wednesday's data also showed that China's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went up 8 percent year on year in April.  The figure moderated from the 8.3 percent year-on-year increase registered in March this year. On a monthly basis, China's PPI gained 0.6 percent in April, compared with the 1.1 percent increase seen in March.  "China's inflation has remained at an overall moderate and controllable level," commented Wen Bin, chief analyst at China Minsheng Bank.  Although both the monthly and year-on-year PPI growth rates slowed, "price hikes in bulk commodities across the globe still impose imported inflationary pressure on PPI," Wen said.  UNCERTAINTIES, POLICY RESPONSE  Experts attributed the current high inflationary pressure in the global market to Western countries' disorderly domestic governance and tendency to stir up trouble and bully other countries, per a recent symposium held by the National Development and Reform Commission.  Major economies in the West have been issuing excess paper currency and implementing loose monetary policies since the pandemic, which has pushed up bulk commodity prices, according to the symposium.  Experts also noted that supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 and some Western countries' recent sanctions on Russia have further choked the global bulk commodity supply.  On the domestic front, a report released on Monday by the People's Bank of China said that shrinking demand, supply shocks and weakened expectations brought about by the recent domestic resurgence of COVID-19 continue to linger, with contact-based consumption such as catering and retail posting a sluggish performance.  The central bank reaffirmed its intention of implementing prudent monetary policy this year in the report, saying that it will avoid "flood-like" stimulus and better utilize monetary policy tools to adjust both the monetary aggregate and the monetary structure.  Supporting the real economy and small and micro businesses, and boosting technological innovation, elderly care services and the clean use of coal while defusing risks faced by financial institutions remain the policy priorities, the report said.  In general, China's economy has been maintained in a reasonable range, with a sufficient supply of industrial and agricultural products, resuming consumption and investment demand and prudent monetary policies, which is conducive to keeping prices stable in the medium-to-long term, according to the report.  &nbsp;    A customer buys vegetables at a supermarket in Linquan County, east China's Anhui Province, May 11, 2022.

[Photo/Xinhua]  China will adopt fiscal and monetary policies prioritizing job creation, as part of efforts to maintain the overall stability of economic performance, according to a decision made at the State Council's Executive Meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.  "The greater-than-expected impacts from the new round of COVID resurgence and shifting dynamics in the international environment have added new downward pressure to the economy in April. It is imperative to stay confident, face difficulties and challenges squarely, and keep overall economic performance stable, to lay the foundation for coordinated progress on all fronts," Li said.  The meeting stressed that fiscal and monetary policies should be employment-oriented. Tax refunds and breaks, deferred payment of social insurance premiums, reductions in financing costs and other measures should all focus on maintaining the stability of market entities, payrolls and employment, to ensure people's basic livelihoods, stabilize growth and drive consumption.  It is necessary to further use a variety of policy tools to mobilize local authorities' enthusiasm and ensure their responsibilities are well fulfilled, in order to effectively stabilize employment.  "We must attach high importance to the work of stabilizing employment. Various supportive policies should be effectively and speedily implemented to encourage and help enterprises keep their payrolls stable. Local governments must fulfill their responsibilities of supporting market entities and stabilizing jobs. Pro-employment policies should be intensified with extended coverage," Li said.  The meeting called for efforts to maintain price stability. China has a sufficient supply of essential livelihood products. That said, work in this regard should not be taken lightly. Solid efforts are needed on grain production to ensure stable grain output and supply and strengthen the foundations of price stability.  While ensuring effective COVID response, further efforts will be made to ensure unimpeded logistics, especially in key areas, and safeguard the stability of industrial and supply chains. The normal supply of energy will be guaranteed.  Measures to expand the coverage and extend the time frame of the policy for deferred payments of old-age insurance premiums will be promptly explored. Localities will be guided to subsidize the utility bills of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed households.  "Prices are the most sensitive indication and also the most important lever of the market. We must attach great importance to price stability, food and energy security, and the stability of industrial and supply chains," Li said.  The meeting also decided to better mobilize existing assets, broaden the channels for private investment and expand effective investment.  The mobilization of existing assets through setting up real estate investment trusts and other means will be encouraged. Localities will be guided to introduce projects to attract investment, and all types of investors will be treated equally.  The market-based operation mechanism will be improved to raise the returns of the projects. New projects invested by recovered funds will be given access to funding from special-purpose bonds. The principle of market-orientation and law-based operation will be upheld, and transaction prices will be set openly and transparently. Source: China Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

Though fully aware of that, the reluctance of the Biden administration to make any substantive moves suggests it is weighing whether the benefits to its people are worth undermining political goals, observers pointed out, calling for immediate efforts to scrap China duties and warning aggressive "toxic" rate hikes will threaten the global economy.  Addressing the nation from Washington on Tuesday, Biden said he could drop some of the tariffs imposed against Chinese imports to help control rising consumer prices in the US, noting that the White House is reviewing the penalties and could opt to "remove them altogether."  "We're looking at what would have the most positive impact," Biden said, adding that removing the tariffs was currently under discussion.  Biden's remarks, which came after similar signals from other US senior officials, show the administration's anxiety and desperation in the face of worsening inflation woes, Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday.  Previously, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, White House press secretary Jen Psaki and Trade Representative Katherine Tai all indicated that China tariff relief is an option as prices soar.  Latest data showed that the US consumer price index (CPI) hit 8.3 percent in April on a yearly basis, slightly moderate than the 8.5 percent increase recorded in March, but still hovers near four-decade high. The figure is also higher than a previous market expectation of 8.1 percent increase.  The current dilemma faced by the Biden administration is the bitter fruits of its own policy, analysts said, as surging inflation resulting from the high energy prices, previous extremely loose monetary policy and tariffs on Chinese imports has worsened the situation.  Best solution  "It's time for the US government to reconsider and lift additional tariffs imposed on Chinese products as soon as possible," Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said when asked about Biden's remarks at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.  "The unilaterally imposed tariffs by the US not only harmed China but also the US as well as the world," he said.  In a recent interview with Forbes, Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang said that the trade war has not reduced the US' trade deficit so far; on the contrary, the trade war has increased US companies' and consumers' costs. The tariffs have cost US corporations more than $1.7 trillion and increased US household spending by $1,300 per year on average.  Additionally, US exports to China in the three years since the start of the trade war - 2018, 2019 and 2020 - were lower than the level in 2017 before the trade war, according to Zhao. During the period, the US lost more than 240,000 jobs due to the trade war.  Dropping tariffs imposed under former president Donald Trump, which caused price rises on everything from clothing, furniture among other daily necessities of US residents, is also believed by economists to be the most apt decision to address the woes.  "A feasible package of liberalization could deliver a one-time reduction in CPI inflation of around 1.3 percentage points, amounting to $797 per US household, about half the size of pandemic relief in 2021," according to research by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) in March.  Moreover, if the US adjusts its tariffs on China, China will also reciprocate and reduce tariffs on US imports, which could be a win-win results for firms and people from both countries, Gao noted.  "Our members have opposed tariffs from the beginning. They are an added cost paid by US businesses and consumers. They contribute to inflationary pressures which have become a major concern for Americans. It's likely that tariffs in many consumer goods will be lifted first," Douglas Barry, Vice President of the Communications and Publications at the US-China Business Council, told the Global Times in an e-mail on Wednesday.  Lower prices will stimulate demand. Companies will have more money to invest, Barry said.  "On the other hand, lifting the tariffs would lead to skepticism about the administration's toughness toward China, and a softer stance may cause Biden to lose some political support at home," Gao said.  According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, Biden officials are divided over easing China tariffs to slow inflation. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and others are reluctant to "relinquish US leverage over China in a continuing effort to reshape Chinese economic behavior," according to the people.  'Toxic' medicine  Last week, the Federal Reserve announced its sharpest rate hike in more than two decades as one of the few options to quell the inflation, but analysts pointed out the rate hikes could be a toxic medicine for the world as well as its own economy.  The Fed's current policy of accelerating monetary tightening will help relieve the situation in the long run, but will need time to take effect. Besides, rate hikes will not help to ease energy prices or address problems on the supply side, Wei Hongxu, a researcher at ANBOUND, a multinational independent think tank, told the Global Times on Wednesday.  Wei warned that if high inflation continues for a while, the US economic growth rate will decline while the Fed maintains its tightening policy.  Fed officials, now committed to a series of half-percentage-point rate increases, said their aggressive efforts to curb consumer and business demand for goods and services through higher borrowing costs were needed to slow the fastest inflation in 40 years, but they also acknowledged it will be "a painful ride," according to a Reuters report Wednesday.  The recent volatility in asset markets is "painful," Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Reuters, but it is also a necessary part of tightening credit conditions in the economy.  Even worse, the spillover risks of a toxic US monetary policy shift have already emerged, as moving from an extremely loose monetary policy to being forced to tighten it to deal with inflation, US monetary policy will cause chaos in international capital flows, which poses great risks to international financial markets and other economies, especially highly indebted countries.  The increase in investment costs has led to a new round of adjustment in the global capital market, including the US, and triggered the return of international capital. This has already happened, Wei said  Furthermore, the appreciation of the US dollar will have an impact on the currencies of other countries, especially emerging markets which will face increased pressure on capital outflows, thereby affecting the monetary, financial and economic stability of these countries. In particular, countries with heavy external debt burdens are constantly experiencing sovereign debt defaults, Wei warned. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

Photo taken on April 15, 2022 shows people applying for engineering construction approvals at a one-stop service center in Ningdu county, Ganzhou, east China’s Jiangxi province. (People’s Daily Online/Zeng Rongfeng)  So far, the number of market entities across the country has exceeded 150 million, with an average annual increase of more than 12 percent. The number of private enterprises in the country increased fourfold in the past decade.  As of the end of 2020, the time needed for starting a company in China had been reduced to less than four workdays, down from 22.9 since the country kicked off its national business system reform in 2014.  “It used to take six months for us to get a business license, but now we can get it in just one workday the soonest possible,” said Phyllis Cheung, CEO of McDonald’s China.  Cheung explained that in the past, her company had to apply for a series of certificates when opening a new restaurant, such as business license, food business license, organization code certificate, tax registration certificate, social insurance registration certificate, and pollutants discharge license.  According to Cheung, some of the certificates have merged into one today and some have been canceled, which significantly saves time for enterprises.  While streamlining approvals, China is also working to improve its management. It launched the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System in 2017, which strengthens supervision on delegated matters when they are being handled and after they have been handled.    Shanghai recently issued a guideline to instruct work resumption of industrial enterprises and established a “white list” mechanism for major enterprises. Photo taken on April 29, 2022 shows employees working in a workshop of Weben Smart Manufacturing System (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (People’s Daily Online/Jiang Huihui)  As of March this year, more than 700 entities had been listed as enterprises with serious illegal and dishonest acts by market regulation authorities across the country, and their information has been disclosed on the system.  Besides, China is constantly enhancing its services for enterprises by optimizing business procedures. In the past, if an enterprise made a mistake when filling an application form, then it had to go to the department in charge again and refill the form. Today, thanks to e-government services, enterprises can apply for certificates online.  So far, 31 provincial-level regions in China have electronized business registration procedures since the country piloted a national electronized registration program in 2016.  According to Zhou Hui, who runs a private vocational school in Changzhou, east China’s Jiangsu province, it took him about one and a half months to apply for a permit for running private vocational schools in the past, but the same application only takes a day nowadays.

(People’s Daily Online/Zhang Lianhua)  “The survival and development of market entities rely on business environment. Great environment makes great enterprises. Relevant departments across China, upholding the vision that business environment means productivity, have constantly optimized business environment with multifaceted measures, which has continuously stimulated the passion of market entities for investment,” said Liu Quanhong, director of the International Economics Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research.  To cope with the impacts of COVID-19 on some market entities, a new version of the new regulation on market entity registration unveiled last year allows market entities with management difficulty to register for suspension, which has provided a “buffer zone” for these entities.  “The business suspension rule is quite considerate and helps enterprises lower cost. It is lending a hand to us,” said Wu Jieping, owner of a tech firm based in Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong province.  According to a plan advancing the modernization of China's market regulation over the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), the country will improve its market regulation system and efficiency eying on the general market, quality and supervision. It will promote the modernization of market regulation, strive to build an international business environment that is market-oriented and law-based, and vitalize the market.  An official with the State Administration for Market Regulation told People’s Daily that the department will further advance pilot programs on improving the business environment and make the market entry and exit mechanism more open, transparent, standard and efficient, so as to set more examples in business environment building and better serve the high-quality economic and social development of the country.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

Photo taken on April 25, 2022, shows that more than 200 new vehicles manufactured by U.S. carmaker Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory are transported to Yantai Port, east China’s Shandong province. (People’s Daily Online/Tang Ke)  Win-win cooperation between China and the U.S. plays a key role in driving world economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many voices have been heard from the American business community urging its government to cooperate with China instead of decoupling so that the two countries could work together for a more peaceful and prosperous world.  Founded in 1973, the USCBC has actively served as a trade bridge between the two countries, which has attracted more than 200 U.S. member companies doing business in China, including many of the world’s iconic brands. The membership is still growing.    Aerial photo taken on March 28, 2022, shows cranes are carrying out container loading operations orderly in Jinhua city, east China’s Zhejiang province. (People’s Daily Online/Hu Xiaofei)  Most of the USCBC members have invested in China for decades with a long vision and commitment, as China remains one of the most essential markets in the world. According to a 2021 survey conducted by USCBC among 107 U.S. firms operating in China, up to 95 percent of the respondents said they were profitable in the past year, and over 40 percent said they will increase investments.  China continues efforts to deepen reform and opening up, optimizing an active and friendly business environment for foreign investors. “American businesses that we talk to are reasonably optimistic about the future,” Allen added.  It’s the most impressive accomplishment of China to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and improve their quality of life, Allen marked, looking forward to more high-quality goods and services in the country with the continuous improvement of living standards.  China’s trade with the U.S. in 2021 reached a record $755.6 billion, up nearly 30 percent year-on-year. Another record shows that the U.S. goods exports to China increased by 21 percent to $149 billion, said a USCBC recent report.  2021 saw strong trade ties between China and the U.S. Agricultural exports and a big boost to the economies of the U.S. states with large agricultural sectors.&nbsp;  All 50 U.S. states exported goods and services to China and benefited from the 858,000-strong American jobs supported by these exports, Allen said. Greater stability can bring more opportunities to businesses and people in both countries.  Imposing tariffs and decoupling from China are not good for the country, for the U.S., and for the world, Allen said, stressing the positive aspects of economic globalization.  “We should reject trade blocs and spheres of influence in favor of enhancing the positive aspects of globalization that have improved standards of living for billions of people over the last several decades,” Allen said. “The world needs China and the U.S. to play a positive role in continuing this contribution to a global public good.”&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

[Photo/Xinhua]  China's inflation is expected to remain mild and controllable this year, leaving room for macro policy fine-tuning and adjustment, experts and analysts said on Wednesday.  They warned of multiple pressures from shrinking demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations amid resurgent domestic COVID-19 cases, as well as a more complicated and grimmer external environment, and said a stronger macro policy response was likely in order to stabilize expectations and shore up growth.  The country's consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in April amid rising prices of fresh vegetables, fresh fruit and diesel fuel, marking the fastest pace in five months, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.  Meanwhile, the country's factory-gate prices rose in April at the slowest rate in a year as the government took steady steps to ensure stable supplies and prices amid international commodity price hikes. China's producer price index, which gauges factory-gate prices, increased 8 percent year-on-year in April, the NBS said.  Wen Bin, chief researcher at China Minsheng Bank, said China's overall inflation level is mild and controllable. Wen said he expected policymakers to increase monetary policy support for hard-hit enterprises and sectors amid COVID-19 outbreaks, which will help ease enterprises' burden and promote economic growth to a reasonable range.  Wen attributed the growth in consumer inflation to food and energy, warning of inflation pressure amid rising international commodity prices. He said more efforts are needed to ensure stable supplies and prices and ensure smooth logistics.  Zhou Maohua, an analyst at China Everbright Bank, said that while the slower increase of the producer price index will help ease pressures on costs for some midstream and downstream manufacturing enterprises, the 8 percent increase in the PPI suggests that raw material prices remain high.  "Many midstream and downstream manufacturing enterprises still face pressure from high production costs," he said.  Looking ahead, Zhou estimated that China's consumer inflation may continue the uptrend seen in the last month but will remain mild overall.  He said the uptrend may continue in the following months, given the resurgent domestic COVID-19 cases, fluctuation of energy prices, a recovery in pork prices and a low comparison base.  However, overall, China's inflation will remain mild given the government's solid moves to control the epidemic, increase the support for enterprises, ensure stable supplies and prices, stabilize industrial and supply chains and ensure smooth logistics, Zhou added.

SHENYANG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Eyeing infrastructure as a pillar for economic and social development, China's central authorities have vowed to build a modern infrastructure system and strengthen infrastructure construction in an all-around way.  Comprehensively strengthening infrastructure construction is of great significance to ensuring national security, smoothing domestic circulation, facilitating the "dual circulation" of domestic and overseas markets, expanding domestic demand and promoting high-quality development, according to a meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs held last month.  Economists believe that China's efforts in infrastructure development will inject new impetus for the country to achieve its economic growth target, and the modern infrastructure system will invigorate China's high-quality development in the long run.  Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 infections, China's investment in infrastructure construction rose 8.5 percent year on year in the first quarter of this year.  During the same period, China's fixed-asset investment in road and waterway infrastructure jumped 11.4 percent year on year to 512 billion yuan (about 76 billion U.S. dollars), according to data from the Ministry of Transport.

(Xinhua/Yang Qing)  Since the beginning of the second quarter, a host of infrastructure projects have commenced across the country. Among them are 45 projects worth 29.2 billion yuan in east China's Fujian Province and 54 projects worth 32.1 billion yuan in Wuhan of central China's Hubei Province.  In addition to traditional infrastructure projects such as water conservancy and transportation facilities, the construction of modern infrastructure such as 5G and big data centers and the construction of green energy systems have become new highlights of the current infrastructure layout, said Xu Hongcai, an economist with the China Association of Policy Science.  "Traditional and modern infrastructure systems will jointly energize China's economic restructuring," Xu added.    The construction site of an artificial intelligence center is seen in Shenyang, northeast China's Liaoning Province, April 29, 2022. (Xinhua/Yang Qing)  China has been working on an integrated big data system across the country, which involves eight national computing hubs and 10 national data center clusters, the National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planner, said in February.  "The country's move to channel more computing resources from the eastern areas to the less developed western regions offers a huge opportunity for enterprises," said Yu Junfang, deputy general manager with the local branch of China Unicom in southwest China's Guizhou Province, home to one of China's computing hubs.  Yu added the company will speed up the construction of data center projects, and strengthen the connection between the Guizhou computing hub and other computing hubs.  On April 26, China Huaneng Group, a major state-owned power company, started the construction on seven large-scale offshore wind power projects in northeast China's Liaoning Province, with a total investment of more than 14 billion yuan. The power generation capacity is expected to reach 1.7 million kilowatts.  Shu Yinbiao, chairman of China Huaneng Group, said the total investment in new energy projects launched by the company in the first half of 2022 will reach 90 billion yuan.

(Xinhua)  During the first three months of the year, some 81,000 5G base stations were built across the country, bringing the total to over 1.5 million, official data showed.  "Infrastructure construction plays a supporting role in promoting national and local high-quality economic development," said Yang Delong, chief economist with First Seafront Fund.  Projects that boost industrial development, such as new energy, smart power grids, cloud computing and smart roads, will benefit the public in the long run and lay a solid foundation for basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035, Yang added.    Aerial photo taken on March 1, 2022 shows a cloud computing base in Zhongwei City, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Wang Peng)  According to this year's government work report, the country plans to issue a total of 3.65 trillion yuan of special-purpose local government bonds in 2022, and launch the construction of an array of major projects, modern infrastructure and renovation of old public facilities.  China has signaled that infrastructure construction investment will play a significant role in expanding domestic demand, promoting circulation and stabilizing growth, said Liang Qidong, vice president of the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences.  For 2022, China's policymakers set the full-year economic growth target at around 5.5 percent, while the country's GDP grew 4.8 percent year on year in the first three months.  Wang Qing, analyst with Golden Credit Rating, forecast that the growth rate of infrastructure investment will rise in the second quarter, further bolstering China's future economic growth.

(Xinhua/Cao Yiming)  BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China will roll out effective measures in time to stabilize employment in a bid to safeguard and improve people's livelihood, a senior official has said.  "The country's employment situation has remained generally stable since the beginning of this year," Yu Jiadong, vice minister of human resources and social security, told Xinhua in an interview.  According to official data, 4.06 million new urban jobs were created in the first four months, and China's surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.5 percent in the first quarter, within the expected target.  However, employment data has fluctuated since March, as a series of factors including the COVID-19 resurgence weighed on China's job market.  Noting that stable employment is a key factor for the economy to function within an appropriate range, Yu called for strengthening the employment-first policy by fully implementing relevant employment measures.  "The top priority is to ensure employment of key groups such as college graduates and migrant workers," Yu said.  China will see the number of new graduates from the country's universities and colleges in 2022 exceed 10 million for the first time, hitting a historic high.  China will expand employment channels for college graduates through multiple measures such as using job-creation subsidies to encourage firms to increase hiring or helping graduates start their own businesses by offering loan support, Yu noted.  Various online recruitment activities will be launched to provide adequate information to the graduates, training courses will be designed to enhance their skills, and targeted services will be offered to graduates experiencing difficulties, Yu said.  For boosting employment among those that had shaken off poverty, Yu urged efforts to deepen labor cooperation between eastern and western regions, develop distinctive industries in regions having been lifted out of poverty, and help cultivate business startups, among other moves.  A total of 31.35 million people that had shaken off poverty found jobs by end-March, official data showed.  Efforts will also be made to stabilize market entities by offering preferential policies including the deferred payment of social insurance, the vice minister said.  "China's economic fundamentals for long-term growth remain sound and the momentum of sustained economic recovery stays unchanged, laying a solid foundation for employment stability," Yu added.

"Please use your mobile phone to scan the QR code and fill in your information," Wang, dressed in a white hazmat suit, kept telling people queued up at a test site in Linqing City.  Wang got the job after submitting an application to a local public welfare employment program in March. Now she makes around 2,000 yuan (about 297 U.S. dollars) per month, which is enough to cover her basic living expenses.  Created and funded by the government, public welfare jobs refer to management and service positions that serve public interests. The policy, which has been implemented in China for decades, has effectively assisted long-term unemployed people to find jobs and helped absorb rural surplus labor and improve the livelihood of the country's low-income population.  In 2020, China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and six other departments jointly issued a notice on making better use of public welfare jobs to enhance employment security. Last month, the ministry once again noted the policy at a press conference, saying that more public welfare jobs will be created as part of the efforts to improve the employment situation of vulnerable groups.  In Linqing, a city with around 800,000 residents, over 3,000 people have benefited from public welfare employment this year, most of them from low-income rural households or the so-called "zero-employment families," whose members are all jobless.  The policy also helps those who face the risk of falling into extreme poverty due to illnesses or disabilities. Ma Xiuzhong, a 31-year-old resident in Zhaoguanying East Village of Linqing, suffers from uremia and is incapable of any heavy labor. Thanks to the public welfare jobs program, he got a "river conservator" job in March, mainly responsible for patrolling the river in his village and cleaning up floating garbages from the water.  "This job requires no heavy labor and fits me well," said Ma, adding that the job means a lot to him and his family -- economically in particular.  Some public welfare jobs have emerged as a result of new, urgent needs of the society, such as Wang's job at the nucleic acid test site amid the COVID-19 outbreak.  Elsewhere in Shandong, the city of Linyi, which has a forest coverage rate of over 23 percent, has enrolled nearly 3,000 people for forest patrol and fire prevention, while Yicheng District of Zaozhuang City has offered seven types of public welfare jobs related to ecological protection, such as afforesting mountains and restoring wetlands.  To date, Shandong has created a total of 409,700 such jobs, 80 percent of which are based in rural areas where employment opportunities are scarcer and public services are often in short supply.  "Public welfare posts attract more people to participate in rural community-level governance, and to engage in major public affairs such as epidemic prevention and protection of farming infrastructure," said Yi Junqiang, director of the Shandong provincial public employment and talent service center.  In December 2021, Shandong put forth a new plan to create about 1.2 million public welfare jobs between 2021 and 2025, mainly for vulnerable social groups and the older people.  "China's active promotion of public welfare jobs will not only help offset the negative impact of COVID-19 on employment, but also give hope to more low-income and low-skilled people in their pursuit of a better life," said Sun Tao, a professor in economics at Shandong University.  As China has set the ambitious goal of achieving "common prosperity" for its 1.4 billion people, Sun said, in the future government expenditures on public services and transfer payments to primary-level governments are expected to further increase, so as to improve both the quantity and quality of public welfare jobs.

(Photo by Zhao Yongzhang/Xinhua)  BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 2.1 percent year on year in April, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Wednesday.  On a monthly basis, the CPI inched up 0.4 percent partly due to the domestic resurgence of COVID-19 and the continuous rise of bulk commodity prices across the globe, noted Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician with the NBS.  Food prices went up 0.9 percent from the previous month, driving up the monthly consumer inflation by about 0.17 percentage points, according to the data.  Specifically, the price of pork, a staple meat in China, increased 1.5 percent month-on-month in April, compared with a 9.3-percent decrease in March. Hog production has gradually tempered and stockpiling of pork to replenish state reserves is in progress, Dong said.  However, pork prices still registered a year-on-year drop of 33.3 percent, narrowing by 8.1 percentage points from the previous month.  Non-food prices rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier, the same growth recorded the previous month. The prices of gasoline, diesel and liquified petroleum gas went up by 29 percent, 31.7 percent and 26.9 percent year on year, respectively.  Wednesday's data also showed that China's producer price index, which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went up 8 percent year on year in April. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, the world's largest free trade deal to date that took effect on Jan. 1, 2022, has further boosted its sales this year.  The RCEP countries account for roughly 30 percent of the world's gross domestic product and population. Over 90 percent of trade in goods among approved member states will gradually be tariff-free.  "We received 100 boxes of durians, which were distributed soon after arrival. Besides community convenience stores, there are also many individual customers," said Huang Meixia with a subsidiary of Charoen Pokphand Group in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Charoen Pokphand Group is a leading agribusiness conglomerate in Thailand.  Huang noted that compared with the same period of last year, the durians are selling well despite a price increase this year.  Durians have conquered the taste of an increasing number of foodies across China. In 2021, the import volume of fresh durians was four times that of 2017.  Nisachol Thaithong, a Thai national in Nanning, Guangxi's capital city, runs a business importing durians from her family's orchard in Thailand to China and has accumulated a stable customer source over the past years.  "When it came to durians in the past, many consumers only knew Golden Pillow. Now they can recognize many more durian varieties," said Nisachol Thaithong.  In Guangxi, more investment is being poured into infrastructure and cold-chain logistics to facilitate cross-border fresh fruit trade.  Wei Pan, a social media influencer in Guangxi, has partnered with Nisachol Thaithong to airlift freshly-picked durians from Thailand to Chinese cities such as Guangzhou and Kunming.  "It takes only two to three hours for the durians to fly from Thailand to China. Their shells are still turquoise when they appear on the Chinese market, indicating their freshness," Wei said.  Guangxi's Qinzhou Port has opened several direct container routes to Thailand. The fruit express line from Laem Chabang to Qinzhou runs four times a week, and the fruits can reach China in about three to four days.  Chinese consumers have strong purchasing power and a massive demand for high-quality products, noted Benjamas Tanvetyanont, Thai consul-general in Nanning.  Apart from Thai durians, durians from Malaysia are also gaining in popularity in China.  Chinese and Malaysian enterprises have recently signed 11 agreements to promote investment and strategic cooperation in cross-border trade, among which the trade of durians has become the focus of attention.  Malaysian Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry Lim Ban Hong said that the RCEP would bring considerable cooperation opportunities to enterprises from both Guangxi and Malaysia. He hopes that under the RCEP, China and Malaysia can establish closer economic and trade cooperation.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(GDS), a Chinese data center operator and service provider, located in Changshu city, east China’s Jiangsu province.  The rapid proliferation of green data centers in China may be attributed to the rapid development of the country's digital economy, which is driving a wave of green transformation among traditional data centers and resulting in the continual expansion of newly developed ones.  GDS Services Ltd. (GDS), a Chinese data center operator and service provider, exemplifies the green development of Chinese data centers.  A green data center of the company, located in Shunyi district of Beijing, covers more than 15,000 square meters and houses over 2,000 equipment cabinets. It ensures smooth video streaming on the smart phones of users from thousands of miles away thanks to its real-time scheduling for computing power  The data center’s power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratio has been drastically reduced to 1.22 by far, said Yang Tao, vice president of GDS. According to him, the green data center, when running at full capacity, can save about 10 million kWh of electricity a year.  What brought down the PUE ratio for the GDS data center were the company's efforts to increase efficiency in both the supply and consumption of electricity.  So far, 34 percent of GDS data centers across China are using green electricity, according to Yang. Besides, the company is also able to make optimal decisions and optimize the use of equipment through dynamic monitoring of key indicators, such as server load changes, indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity, as well as the starting frequency of heating and ventilation equipment.    An employee checks servers at a cloud computing data center of Hangzhou Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd., a conglomerate based in Hangzhou, capital of east China’s Zhejiang province, Sept. 1, 2020. (People’s Daily Online/Long Wei)  The number of data centers, known as the cornerstone of digital economy, has increased exponentially in China in recent years. However, their escalating energy consumption is causing growing worry, despite their impressive computer capacity.  China believes that to promote green development of data centers is not only beneficial to the sustainable development of digital economy, but also critical to energy conservation of new infrastructure. Therefore, it has ramped up efforts to advance the green and low-carbon transformation of data centers.  According to data released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and other authorities, 153 national-level green data centers have been built in three batches across the country.  Besides, the country has selected and promoted five batches of 157 advanced technologies to accelerate its pace to lead the green and low-carbon development of data centers.  “Data centers are major power consumers. Their expansion inevitably causes a substantial rise in energy consumption,” pointed out Chen Ying, secretary general of the Chinese Institute of Electronics.  It’s estimated that data centers in China accounted for 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent of the total electricity consumption in the country in 2020, according to Chen.  Besides, a new generation of information technology is significantly driving the demands for data storage, computing, and application, Chen said, adding it is also urgent to standardize the recycling and disposal of obsolete equipment from data centers to avoid environmental pollution.    Photo taken on Dec. 24, 2021 shows a 125MW distributed wind power project in Xiamen township, Kongtong district, Pingliang city, northwest China’s Gansu province. (People’ s Daily Online/Wu Xihui)  By 2025, the computing power of data centers in China will rise to 3.3 times that of 2020, said a plan for the development of China’s information and communication sector during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) period.  “Speeding up the construction of green data centers has become a basic requirement to ensure the sustainability of resources and environment. Besides, it is helpful for increasing the utilization efficiency of energy resources and achieving the carbon peak and neutrality goals,” said an official with the department of energy conservation and integrated use of the MIIT.  At present, quite a number of companies are actively developing new technologies for the green transformation of data centers.  In November 2020, an integrated energy station built by the Ningbo branch of the State Grid Corporation of China in east China’s Zhejiang province was put into operation. The data center of the energy station became the first of its kind in Zhejiang to use container-type equipment room with a liquid cooling system, which can save more than 430,000 kWh of electricity a year.  Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing division of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has made available to companies its self-developed immersion liquid cooling technology. By immersing servers in a special insulating coolant to enable heat generated by servers to be quickly carried away to external circulation by the coolant, the technology can reduce energy consumption by over 70 percent.  Not long ago, China has approved a project to build eight national integrated computing hubs with 10 data center clusters across the country, completing the overall layout for the country’s national integrated big-data center system while indicating that its strategy to channel more computing resources from the eastern regions to its less developed yet resource-rich western regions is in full swing.  The east-to-west computing resource transfer project is expected to guide the development of data center industry in western China, which will effectively increase the utilization of renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and water, in the country’s western regions and eventually achieve an effective balance between industrial supply and energy consumption.&nbsp;  By the end of 2023, the PUE ratio of newly built large and super large data centers in China will be reduced to less than 1.3, according to a three-year action plan on the development of large data centers between 2021 and 2023 released by the MIIT last July.  Such rigid targets and timetable are believed to further speed up the green transformation of data centers across the country.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

JI HAIXIN/FOR CHINA DAILY  China has freed up the coastal piggyback system for shipping of foreign trade containers between ports within China, enabling foreign logistics giants such as A.P.Moller-Maersk and Orient Overseas Container Line to plan first voyages by the end of this month, analysts said on Monday.  The move highlights China's willingness to further its opening-up policy, they said.  Meanwhile, the administrative committee of Shanghai's Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone said at a news conference on Monday that China will introduce a container freight forward rate contract trading platform.  Despite a complex international situation and given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Yangshan Special Comprehensive Bonded Zone in Shanghai has encouraged enterprises to resume production, and the business in the bonded zone has operated smoothly in the first quarter, the committee said.  "The new service (for shipping of foreign trade containers between ports within China) is expected to help cut the logistics costs for both exporters and importers, improve the utilization rates of container ships, and relieve the tightness of shipping capacity to a certain extent," said Zhou Zhicheng, a researcher at the Beijing-based China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.  Jens Eskelund, China chief representative of Danish shipping and logistics giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, said the permission for foreign carriers to carry out international relay is very welcome news and represents a tangible step for foreign carriers in China toward achieving market access on reciprocal terms.  "International relay will allow us to improve services, giving our customers more flexibility and options for their shipments. We are preparing the first shipment in Yangshan terminal in Shanghai, together with the Lin-gang Special Area Administration and other relevant stakeholders," Eskelund said.  Hong Kong-based Asia Shipping Certification Services Co Ltd has been officially approved to carry out statutory ship inspection work in the Lin-gang Special Area as the first inspection agency that is not incorporated in the Chinese mainland.  In March and April, the daily average container throughput in Yangshan terminal reached 66,000 and 59,000 twenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs, each accounting for 90 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the average level seen in the first quarter.  "Despite the recent resurgence of local COVID-19 cases, operations at ports have been relatively stable. With more companies resuming their business in late April, operations are foreseen to improve further this month," said Lin Yisong, an official of the Lin-gang Special Area Administration.  As of Sunday, 193 companies operating in the Yangshan Special Comprehensive Bonded Zone, or 85 percent of the total, had resumed operations. About half of total employees who work in the bonded zone arrived at their workplaces physically.  "The coastal piggyback system will help boost logistics capacity, improve efficiency and provide more business opportunities for global companies to further expand their market presence in China," said Bai Ming, deputy director of international market research at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.  "The move is more advanced than the coastal transportation policies being practiced in some countries. Major economies such as the United States and Japan have not opened up coastal transportation for global shipping firms yet," Bai said.  China's total imports and exports of goods expanded 1.9 percent year-on-year to a record 32.16 trillion yuan ($4.77 trillion) last year, despite a worldwide slump in shipments due to the pandemic.

[Photo/Xinhua]  China is expected to deepen deposit rate reforms to lower corporate financing costs as part of the central bank's well-calibrated efforts to strike a balance between stabilizing economic growth and sheltering from the risk of capital outflows, economic experts said on Tuesday.  They gave the remarks after the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said it had guided banks to form a market-based adjustment mechanism of deposit rates last month, helping send the weighted average deposit rate in the last week of April to 2.37 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from a week earlier.  The central bank will employ the "significant role" of the adjustment mechanism and improve the market-based formation of interest rates to promote a reduction in corporate financing costs, said the first-quarter monetary policy report released on Monday.  The new mechanism marks part of the central bank's stepped-up support for the real economy, as the report pledged to give proactive responses to stabilize the economy, boost market confidence, and focus on assisting smaller businesses and those hampered by COVID-19.  Shao Yu, chief economist at Orient Securities, said the adjustment mechanism functions somewhat like a cut in deposit rates, which will help reduce the funding costs of banks, stabilize their profit margins in lending, and boost credit expansion in the real economy.  Under the mechanism, banks are encouraged to adjust their deposit rates based on interest rates in the bond and lending markets, the report said.  Thanks to the mechanism, loan prime rates－the benchmark lending rates calculated based on lending rates quoted by banks to their highest quality customers－could have greater room to decline going forward and would help alleviate the financing burden in the real economy, said Ying Xiwen, a senior researcher at China Minsheng Bank.  The experts said the launch of the new mechanism, instead of high-profile moves like policy interest rate cuts, reflected the worst-case scenario mindset of policymakers, which takes risks into full consideration and reacts accordingly.  Being alert to risks of capital outflows and currency depreciation, the central bank created the new tool to bolster the economy, Ying said. This was the case, given that the typical move of policy rate cuts could be significant in signaling monetary easing and amplifying the risks of capital outflows.  The monetary policy report showed the central bank's emphasis on coping with risks, including policy adjustments by overseas central banks, global inflationary risks aggravated by geopolitical tensions, and a surge in local COVID cases.  The report said major developed economies have sped up monetary tightening with spillover effects such as greater volatility in global financial markets and cross-border capital flows. The central bank will pay close attention to monetary adjustments in developed economies, strengthen macroprudential management of cross-border capital flows and improve the management of market expectations, the report added.  The report said efforts will be made to assist in the supply of food and energy, ramp up structural monetary aids and support local governments in improving property market policies while refraining from taking the property market as a tool for short-term stimulus.

Ethiopia's state-owned Ethio-Telecom on Monday evening launched a pre-commercial 5G services trial in the capital Addis Ababa in partnership with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. (Xinhua/Michael Tewelde)  ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's state-owned Ethio-Telecom on Monday evening launched a pre-commercial 5G services trial in the capital Addis Ababa in partnership with Chinese telecom giant Huawei.  Ethiopia's first 5G services, which was launched across six mobile stations in Addis Ababa, is said to be part of the Ethiopian government's digital transformation aspirations.  "We are pleased and honored to launch the world's advanced fifth-generation network. We are committed to seeing a digital Ethiopia, which will uplift our people's overall living conditions," Frehiwot Tamiru, CEO of Ethio-Telecom, said during the launching event.  Tamiru said the 5G network service, characterized by the fastest speed and low latency and massive communication capability that offers service for up to 1 million connections within 1 square km, can unlock blazing fast speeds in more places, real-time responses and massive connectivity.  Tamiru noted that Ethio-Telecom will expand its pre-commercial trial service across the capital and regional cities, reaching up to 150 sites over the coming 12 months.  With high speeds, superior reliability and negligible latency, 5G will impact industries such as critical services requiring real-time decisions, manufacturing plants, remote healthcare, precision agriculture, as well as facilitate the Internet of Things (IoT), said Tamiru.  "This 5G service will provide our customers with best-in-class solutions, improve their experience and allow our enterprise customers to boost productivity, enhance operational efficiency, and introduce new solutions to their customers," Tamiru said.  Ethio-Telecom, which is the sole telecom services provider in Ethiopia so far, said the pre-commercial trial of the 5G service was launched after a temporary 5G Spectrum approval by the Ethiopian Communication Authority while its strategic partner Huawei technologies deployed the 5G network.  Hou Wei, Vice President of Huawei Northern Africa, said as one of Ethio-Telecom's strategic partners, Huawei will keep focusing on cooperating with Ethiopia's state-owned telecom service provider through the provision of state-of-the-art solutions, reliable delivery, fast response and trustable maintenance.  "Huawei has been devoting (itself) to this market for more than 20 years, and we have observed the fast development and great evolution of the telecom industry in this country," he said.  Ethio-Telecom said the full commercialization of the 5G service is dependent on the readiness and demand from the players in the ecosystem, which includes customers' readiness to use the service as well as availability of 5G-enabled devices and smartphones.  The company, which is recognized as one of Africa's oldest telecom service providers, has more than 60.8 million subscribers, with about 25 million data and Internet users.  As part of its ambition to provide modern telecom service to its users, the company partners with Chinese tech companies, mainly Huawei and ZTE.  The company said it has already expanded 3G and 4G networks throughout the East African nation effectively, achieving 97 percent telecom services coverage while densifying the network and upgrading the earlier technologies to the latest ones.

(Photo by Nie Shuang/Xinhua)  BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Amid COVID-19 disruptions, China has spared no effort in ensuring unimpeded logistics and stable supply chains as part of its resilience advancement of economic flows.  "We must consider a full picture of national development to ensure unimpeded transportation and logistics, normalizing key industrial and supply chains, suppliers for COVID response, and critical infrastructure," said a recent meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.  A raft of policies and measures has transpired to facilitate flows of logistics and industries across the nation.  PASSAGES UNBLOCKED  Efforts have been made to implement targeted traffic control by category, improve services for truck drivers, and ensure the transport of vital medical supplies, and people's livelihood, energy and agricultural supplies, according to departments, including the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Ministry of Public Security.  To ensure efficient operation of the transportation network's backbone, a unified national pass for vehicles transporting vital supplies was adopted by 24 Chinese provinces by the end of April, with transit stations for emergency supplies opened in epidemic-hit regions such as Shanghai.  MOT data showed that all expressway toll stations and service areas once temporarily closed nationwide had reopened as of May 4, without any temporary closure of toll stations on provincial highways.  "Currently, logistics in Shanghai and other key areas are gradually improving, with initial results in rectifying excessive prevention and control problems," said MOT official Shu Chi, citing improvements in the country's transport capacity indicators and once-impeded logistics.  TARGETED SUPPORT  Apart from preferential taxation support, Chinese authorities announced that eligible express delivery income would be exempt from value-added tax from May 1 to the end of the year. It is likely to reduce the burden for related enterprises by about 1 billion yuan (148.96 million U.S. dollars).  These offered only a glimpse of nine primary policies and measures targeted at firms in the transport and logistics sectors introduced by the Ministry of Finance and other departments, along with incentives from the central bank and the country's top forex and banking regulators.  Dong Yu, executive vice president of the China Institute for Development Planning, Tsinghua University, said to enliven logistics by smoothing micro-circulation, "we should make better use of new technology with more efficient scheduling."  As intelligent unmanned delivery vehicles deliver goods on roads in Guangdong and Shanghai, cities including Beijing have established a "white-list" mechanism to secure the delivery capacity of fresh produce suppliers.  STABILIZING CHAINS  Efforts will ensure the solid implementation of the "white-list" approach to support the resumption of work for key companies and remove bottlenecks in some places, said Xin Guobin, vice minister of industry and information technology, in an interview with Xinhua.  His remarks came in light of the new challenges that have emerged since mid-March, including sporadic resurgences of COVID-19 and a complex external environment, resulting in the suspension of some factory activities and freight transport.  In southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, millions of integrated chips are produced on a daily basis and delivered to downstream enterprises from the China Resources Microelectronics industrial park.  Zhuang Hengqian, deputy general manager of the company, said that much of the company's raw materials are from the Yangtze River Delta. But since the government promoted active resumption of "white-listed" enterprises, their production has gradually returned to normal.  Currently, the country is seeing an accelerated pace of resumption of production in key areas and industries, Xin said, adding that 86.8 percent of enterprises among the 666 companies included in the first batch of the "white list" in Shanghai had resumed work by April 28.  With swift countermeasures to stabilize the industrial and supply chains, the country's industrial economy has shown positive signs of stabilization, seen in a narrowed decline in industrial electricity consumption for two consecutive weeks since the second week of April, Xin added.

(Graphic: Zero-sum or zero-carbon/People's Daily Online)  The Glasgow climate summit held last year was largely viewed as a chance for redemption. After the grim outcome of the (2°C) mitigation target set at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, humanity's "last chance" to save the planet, nations were nudged to give climate cooperation another shot. Few world leaders are more zealous and vocal on the matter than US president Joe Biden, who has proposed a portfolio of ambitious goals and called for joint collaboration between major players and, in particular, the US and China.  Then, last February, in a surprise move, the Biden administration announced that it would extend the Trump-era Section 201 tariffs slapped on solar panels, in a bid to "continue facilitating positive adjustment to competition" from imported photovoltaic cells. Though the administration did offer some clues on the "positive adjustment," almost four years after the tariffs were levied, experts argued that America's solar industry remained nascent in its development despite full-blown trade barriers and that the decision came at an emissions cost.  In an opinion essay published earlier this month in The Hill, John Paul Helveston, an American researcher, debated that tariffs won't help the US build a "robust solar industry." He contended that China's tremendous R&amp;D efforts on photovoltaic (PV) innovations, which helped slash the prices of most PV panels from $2,000 per kilowatt to just $300 per kilowatt, cannot be simply duplicated. It is highly unlikely that another nation will be able to "replicate China's skills in the time frame needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change," he cited an article he co-wrote in Science back in 2019, adding, "Rather than continuing the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese solar panels, the US and others should be partnering with Chinese firms to obtain low-cost technologies and components to increase domestic deployment of renewables as fast as possible to meet the narrow window left to decarbonize."  Low-cost solar technologies and components, however, have been the very items subject to Washington's ongoing investigation.  The New York Times reported on April 29 that, amidst an investigation by the US Commerce Department targeting Chinese-made PV parts, the US solar industry has been "frozen," with over 300 solar projects being "canceled or delayed." American energy enterprises, big and small, have all been dragged into the quagmire of self-censorship over Chinese solar parts. "The investigation is having a catastrophic negative impact on the renewable energy sector and driving up electricity prices. With each day the tariff investigation continues, the country is falling further behind in achieving our climate goals," said Nick Bullinger, COO of a Chicago-based solar company, in an interview that appeared in the Times article.    U.S. President Joe Biden (R) speaks during an event, at the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, on May 9, 2022. Biden said that the administration is "discussing" whether to drop hiked tariffs on Chinese products. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  From the perspective of environmental benefits or from the standpoint of economic interests, Washington's 4-year-long-and-counting solar clampdown is cost-ineffective, as it collides with even Biden's own climate agenda.  US president Joe Biden attended the Glasgow summit with high hopes—100% renewable energy by 2035; but the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), an NGO, estimated that America's current production capacity only makes up 15% of its demand. Neither will taxing and purging Chinese solar panels or PV parts help "bring jobs back home," since even with heavy tariffs the US remains heavily dependent on imported PV products.  Besides, the volume of jobs generated by solar installations in the US is ten times larger than the manufacturing jobs created by the nation's entire solar sector, according to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). As a letter sent to President Biden last January by eight American senators (from both parties) stated, the Section 201 tariffs had "led to the loss of more than 62,000 American clean energy jobs and 10.5 gigawatts of foregone solar deployment." It is difficult then to tell who the tariffs and investigation are designed to punish: overseas solar producers or the American labor force?

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  But it's not hard to detect what formula is being applied in America's zero-carbon solution—its default zero-sum fixation. After all, the one-nation's-gain-representing-another's-loss mindset takes various shapes in the China-US relations from Washington's point of view.  On the global stage, it is reflected in Washington's unreasonable belief that China's global presence, such as donating COVID-19 vaccines to developing nations, will undermine the superpower's global influence.  In the economic sphere, it is manifested in America's obsession with punitive tariffs, which it deems will help reverse trade deficits and boost domestic industry, even though the burden will ultimately be shifted towards American consumers in the form of rising prices.  In the technological and academic realms, it is showcased in America's year-long crackdown on Chinese tech companies and its unjustified witch-hunt targeting Chinese academics and students.  ... ...  The aforementioned aspects of Washington's zero-sum practices are epitomized by its now-stagnant solar industry, which in turn has demonstrated why such a mindset won't work. Internationally, it will risk hindering the joint cause of emissions reduction; economically, it will impede the low-hanging fruits and long-term benefits brought by the should-be full-fledged solar sector; and, from the perspectives of innovation and technological progress, it will further dampen the outlook of cooperation on green innovations.

(Xinhua/Liu Lei)  Dwelling on a planet that is currently plagued by a global pandemic (accompanied by inflation and a possible recession), haunted by continuous wars and conflicts, and overshadowed by the looming threat of global warming, we all know that a zero-sum fixation and a Cold-War mindset won't help fix any of these global problems. On the contrary, they are destined to make the planet warmer, wars deadlier, and other global puzzles more insoluble.  For Washington, it needs to face the reality that it cannot achieve technological hegemony or climate leadership by setting up a new Iron Curtain to deter and isolate China. Returning to a rational and pragmatic China policy is the sole way to nurture healthy and sustainable China-US ties and encourage the two sides to work together on issues of common and global concern. Conversely, the zero-sum mindset is bound for a lose-lose path.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

A gun. A train of helpless commuters. In what should be a rush-hour nightmare on the NYC subway on April 12, Gerard Baker saw something different. The renowned Wall Street Journal columnist diagnosed the Brooklyn subway attack as an emblem of the "failure of American government at all levels." The failure, as he elaborated in his opinion piece headlined A Crime Scene Where the Victims Wore Masks, has permeated everything: from the mask mandate to law enforcement to the border crisis…  Except for one thing: gun control.  Ignoring the gun issue in a gun violence incident is ridiculous enough, and it is equally absurd that mask-wearing had to bear the onus at a crime scene. But sadly, such an attitude falls in line with the popular belief shared by a significant number of Americans, that "excessive" mask mandates are somehow more noxious to society than an excessive number of guns. It reflects a disturbing anomaly in today's America, where, even during a pandemic, guns are viewed as a necessity while masks are treated as a liability.  Too many guns have always been a perennial problem in American society, which has gradually explored its own way of "living with guns"—defending firearms with more firearms. On average, one hundred Americans own some 120.5 guns, according to available data published by the Small Arms Survey, which estimated that 81.4 million Americans who possess (393 million) guns make up about 46% of the world's total civilian firearms ownership.  America's superabundance of civilian-held guns is a problem of its own making. Gun shops in the US are so omnipresent that they outnumber Starbucks, McDonald's and grocery stores combined, according to Statista. With lax and counteractive federal and state laws as well as loose background checks, buying a lethal weapon in America is so easy that "it doesn't make sense," as former US president Barack Obama once declared.    Guns are on display at the Dallas Gun Show in Parker, a suburban city of Dallas, Texas, the United States, Jan. 22, 2022. (Photo by Lin Li/Xinhua)  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans' gun hoarding habit has grown out of control. Forbes reported that Americans bought 19.9 million firearms last year, the second-highest year only after 2020, which saw a record-setting of 22.8 million purchases of firearms. "There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic," said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, an American politician.  Accompanying the surging gun sales is the soaring number of gun violence incidents: both gun-related suicides and homicides have spiked in the US. Between March 01, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the US saw a 30% upsurge in nationwide gun violence rates, according to a report published in Nature. In 2020 alone, 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US, of which 54% were suicide deaths, 611 people died from mass shootings and 19,508 from gun-related homicide or murder (In 2021, all of these numbers continued to climb).  Racism-driven shootings (e.g., 2021 Atlanta spa shootings) and indiscriminate mass shootings (such as the Brooklyn subway shooting), among other gruesome gun-related homicides, occur so often that they almost make America's gun crisis sound like a cliché, receiving a period of attention that is so short-lived that hardly has the next gun tragedy arrives that the previous one starts to fade away from the public's radar. So much so that Americans and the global audience have already developed their immunity to the "horrifying shooting—crying for gun control—political impasse—more horrifying shooting" vicious circle.    A sign reminding passengers to wear face masks is seen on the window of a subway train in Chicago, the United States, on Feb. 28, 2022. (Photo by Vincent D. Johnson/Xinhua)  Masks, on the other hand, have faced a totally different fate in American society. Their very existence has come under serious doubts and "life-threatening" challenges since the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed almost one million Americans.  They survived two American presidents: Trump mocked the act of mask-wearing and refused to wear one until July 2020; Biden prematurely dropped the mask mandate for vaccinated people briefly before another surge of cases hit the US.  They were rendered useless in states like Florida and Texas, belittled as ineffective by politicians, including US senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, and portrayed by popular media outlets such as the FOX News as something that can achieve nothing, but are attacks on the public's "liberty" and "freedom."  Finally, on April 18, a Florida judge struck down the federal mask mandate on airplanes and other public transit systems. At a time when only 66% of Americans are fully vaccinated, a rate far below the number needed for optimal herd immunity, and with daily averages still above 50,000 new cases, the ruling has invited grave concerns and criticisms. "The science on masking did not change (with the ruling)," wrote Aaron E. Carroll, a public health expert, in a New York Times article. He added that the reason why several governors and businesses didn't hesitate to abandon mask requirements (even long before the ruling) is that "these groups have interests that compete with science."  Despite their treatments being poles apart, guns and masks point to the exact same crisis management mechanism in the US, where one group's liberty takes precedence over the whole society's safety, where science and expertise yield to political or business interests, where saving more lives isn't as convincing to some politicians as saving more votes. In such an upended reality, it's hard to fathom when enough will finally be enough.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Photo shows medical experts and local people in a mobilization and health education activity of a China-UK-Tanzania tripartite pilot project on malaria control. (Photo courtesy of the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)  Xi made the remarks in a congratulatory letter to the International Forum on the 50th Anniversary of the Discovery of Artemisinin and on Building a Global Community of Health for All.  In the letter, Xi also hailed the important contributions to the global prevention and treatment of malaria and to the protection of human health made by artemisinin, a specific anti-malaria drug first discovered and successfully extracted by China 50 years ago.  The letter demonstrated the Chinese leader's lofty vision of bearing in mind the well-being of the world and the value orientation of putting people first.  The story of artemisinin mirrors a success made by human beings in the arduous fight against diseases.  Fifty years ago, Chinese scientists, represented by Tu Youyou, firstly discovered and successfully extracted artemisinin thanks to their relentless efforts, which was later made into a new anti-malaria drug that is both effective and affordable, and comes with mild side effects.    A free clinic activity for children is held by a Chinese medical aid team in Sierra Leone and an expert team sent to the country by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. (Photo courtesy of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)  "Artemisinin marks a small step in the process of human beings conquering malaria, and it is also a gift to the world from traditional Chinese medicine," said Tu.  Numerous lives have been saved in Asia, Africa, Europe and America thanks to the discovery of artemisinin, and the lactone generated from sweet wormwood extracts protects a significant number of families. According to statistics released by the World Health Organization, artemisinin has save millions of lives since artemisinin-based drugs were promoted globally as antimalarials. More than 240 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have benefited from artemisinin treatment, and about 1.5 million patients have escaped death thanks to this treatment.    Chinese herbal expert Tu Youyou wins the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for her contributions to malaria treatment, Oct. 5, 2015.  The story of artemisinin mirrors the mutual assistance offered by China and other developing countries.  As a result of China's success in eradicating malaria at home, it has also launched large foreign-aid programs to help other countries prevent the disease with artemisinin.  By the end of 2021, China had provided billions of doses of artemisinin medicines, trained tens of thousands of anti-malaria professionals for developing countries, assisted in the construction of malaria prevention and treatment centers for 30 countries, and sent 28,000 medical team members to 72 developing countries for malaria prevention and treatment. These concrete actions have made important contributions to the global efforts in preventing and treating malaria.  Thanks to a China-aided malaria elimination program, the number of malaria cases has dropped by 98 percent in Comoros, while deaths from the infection have been eliminated.  Senegalese President Macky Sall noted that it was because of the support from China and other partners that his country has achieved remarkable progress in the prevention and control of malaria.  The story of artemisinin mirrors China's efforts to benefit the world with its own development.  Humanity is a community with a shared future. Solidarity and cooperation remain the most powerful weapons against global and regional public health challenges. Be it joining hands with the rest of the world to combat malaria, or joining international cooperation in the fight against SARS, bird flu, Ebola and COVID-19, China has always been giving a helping hand to other countries to tide over difficulties.  Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has carried out its largest emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It has provided hundreds of billions of anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations and supplied 2.1 billion doses of vaccine to more than 120 countries and international organizations. It is making COVID-19 vaccines an accessible and affordable public product for developing countries.  From eliminating major infectious diseases such as malaria, to promoting international cooperation on the fight against COVID-19, China has always put people and their lives in the first place, which is responsible for not only the health and lives of the Chinese, but also the global public health cause. With concrete actions, the country is practicing the vision of building a global community of health for all and building a powerful joint force for the world to fight COVID-19.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(People’s Daily Online/Shi Kang)  Having been through hot and cold wars, hardships and tribulations, people in Asia deeply cherish the value of peace and understand that development gains do not come easily. Xi’s propositions put forward at the recently-concluded annual conference of the BFA&nbsp;charted directions for maintaining peace, promoting cooperation, and enhancing solidarity among Asian countries and pointed the way for their seizing historic opportunity to build a community with a shared future for Asia.  Over the past decades, Asia has enjoyed overall stability and rapid and continued economic growth, making possible the Asian Miracle.  “Peace and stability in our region does not fall into our lap automatically or come as charity from any country. Rather, it is the result of the joint efforts of countries in the region,” Xi pointed out in his speech.  Rising from the misery inflicted by colonialism, militarism, and hegemonism, Asia knows the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century.  The current European security crisis has made more and more Asian countries realize that they can only keep their future in their own hands when they&nbsp;honor such principles as mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, and follow a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship.    The first special train running between Yichun city, east China’s Jiangxi province, and the ASEAN countries via Ningbo city, east China’s Zhejiang province, is being loaded at the section No. 370 of the Jiangxi provincial bureau of the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration at Yichunxi Railway Station, Jan. 27, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Zhou Liang)  Against the backdrop of&nbsp;weak and faltering global economic recovery, Asia is an important powerhouse for global economic growth.  In 2021, the share of the Asian economy in the world economy rose to 47.4 percent at purchasing power parity, and the growth rate of the Asian economy is expected to reach 4.8 percent in 2022, higher than the global average, according to a report released during the BFA Annual Conference 2022.  Win-win cooperation is a sure path to Asian development and the key to Asia’s long-term steady development.  Asia-Pacific countries have always upheld globalization and multilateralism, said Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, member of Council of Advisors of the BFA, former Under-Secretary-General&nbsp;of the United Nations (UN), and former Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP).    The first international freight train trip from Xi’an, capital of northwest China’s Shaanxi province to Vientiane, capital of Laos, via the China-Laos Railway starts from Xi’an International Logistics and Trade Park, April 22, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Liu Xiang)  Multilateral trade agreements signed in the Asia-Pacific region account for more than half of the total signed globally, according to Akhtar, who noted that multilateral mechanisms in the region will inject new impetus into the continuous recovery of the Asian economy and even the global economy.  The entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement and the opening to traffic of the China-Laos Railway has generated new opportunities for fostering a more open Asia-wide market. Countries on the continent are bound to make new strides in mutually beneficial cooperation.  The prosperity and stability in Asia is hard-won and couldn’t be cherished too much. Choosing dialogue and cooperation over zero-sum games, openness and inclusiveness over a closed-door and exclusive approach, and exchanges and mutual learning over a sense of superiority: this is the only choice worthy of the broad-mindedness of Asians.  It is the heartfelt wish shared by people in Asia that countries follow the path of peace and development, seek win-win cooperation, and contribute to an Asian family of unity and progress together.  Asian countries are wise and capable enough to cement ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture, and uphold a regional order that balances the aspirations and accommodates the interests of all parties.  As Asia enjoys sound development momentum, countries both in and outside the region should all add splendor rather than trouble to the region, which should be the basic norm for their participation in Asian affairs.  Any attempt to stick to the Cold War mentality and deliberately provoke confrontation to undermine the development of Asia will find little support.  As a member of the Asian family, China will always be an active participant in and important contributor to the peaceful development and win-win cooperation in Asia, no matter how the world changes.  China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, as well as openness and cooperation, actively advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and promote the implementation of the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative it proposed, thus continuously injecting positive energy into the peace, development and win-win cooperation in Asia and the world.  As Xi said, to break through the mist and embrace a bright future, the biggest strength comes from cooperation and the most effective way is through solidarity.  The open, inclusive, and confident China will stand with various countries in solidarity under the banner of true multilateralism. They will stay committed to the regionalism featuring lasting peace, common development, and openness, and jointly build a community with a shared future for Asia and a community with a shared future for mankind.

Photo taken on April 17 shows street lamp banners of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 posted near the Boao airport in Qionghai, south China's Hainan province. (People's Daily Online/Meng Zhongde)  Against this backdrop, Chinese President Xi Jinping, aiming to safeguard common interests of the world and create a future shared by mankind, encouraged the world to work together to tackle global governance challenges and embrace a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, when addressing the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2022 on April 21.  He also stressed promoting the common values of humanity and upholding true multilateralism, saying it is particularly important for major countries to lead by example.  His proposals fully demonstrated China's sense of responsibility to lead the reform of global governance system and promote historical progress in the quest of peace and justice.  The world must uphold solidarity as it rises up to global governance challenges.  "In this day and age, the international community has evolved so much that it has become a sophisticated and integrated apparatus. Acts to remove any single part will cause serious problems to its operation. When that happens, both the victims and the initiators of such acts will stand to lose."  President Xi's simile vividly explained that countries around the world share a same future. Facing outstanding global challenges, the right choice remains to enhance international cooperation and give full play to the global governance system, rather than doing the opposite and arbitrarily hindering international cooperation under all kinds of excuses.  Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, some countries have been trying to tie the whole world to it, turning world economy into a political issue, a tool and even a weapon, with a total disregard for whether it would impact the life of the people around the world.  Such practice will not help solve the crisis at all, and may destroy the international economic cooperation outcomes achieved in the past decades.  As it confronts global governance challenges, the world must uphold real multilateralism.    Photo taken on April 17 shows the International Conference Center of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  While the globe remains in the grip of the pandemic, it is facing new traditional security risks. Meanwhile, the widening development gap is further bothering the sluggish global recovery, and new issues such as digital governance are emerging while climate change and other governance issues still need to be addressed.  It is never a good idea to go it alone to solve these problems. Global actions, response and cooperation are required to overcome these concerns. Only by practicing a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, can countries expand common ground and build the most powerful strength.  Hegemonism and power politics are presently posing a grave danger to the world's peace and progress. It is urgent to uphold true multilateralism and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which is also a common aspiration of the international society.  Major country must fulfill their responsibilities as the world rises up to global governance challenges.    A sub-forum of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 is held, April 20, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  A country’s international status is measured by its openness of mind, breadth of vision, and sense of responsibility rather than its size, strength or power. "It is particularly important for major countries to lead by example in honoring equality, cooperation, good faith and the rule of law, and act in a way befitting their status," President Xi said.  To maintain their hegemonic status, a few major countries have stuck to Cold War mentality and provoked confrontations, which further exacerbated tensions and separation, making more troubles for the troubled world.  In today’s world, unilateralism and excessive pursuit of self-interest are doomed to fail; so are the practices of decoupling, supply disruption and maximum pressure; so are the attempts to forge “small circles” or to stoke conflict and confrontation along ideological lines. Major countries should follow the trend of the times and play a constructive role in global governance.  China is enhancing and improving global governance with concrete actions. Facing the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, it is actively promoting all relevant parties to improve global public health governance, so as to build concerted strength against the virus. When addressing the outstanding security risks, it has proposed a Global Security Initiative to contribute to the reform of the global security governance system. To jump-start the sluggish world economy, the country is also committed to improving global economic governance and building an open world economy. It has raised and is implementing the Global Development Initiative to help countries tide over difficulties.  Countries around the world are like passengers aboard the same ship who share the same destiny. For the ship to navigate the storm and sail toward a bright future, all passengers must pull together. The thought of throwing anyone overboard is simply not acceptable.  Difficulties and challenges are not to be afraid of. What's important is to up hold solidarity and be courageous. China will collaborate with the international community to follow the trend of the times featuring peace, development and win-win cooperation, cope with global challenges with cooperation and enhance global governance with concrete actions, so as to move in the direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

On April 21, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech via video at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2022 in Boao, south China’s Hainan province.  In his speech, Xi profoundly analyzed the security challenges confronting today’s world and solemnly proposed the Global Security Initiative out of a strong sense of responsibility for the future of humanity.  The initiative is another important global public good offered by China following the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Global Development Initiative (GDI). It represents vivid practice of the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind in the security field, and contributes China’s solutions to problems haunting global security governance.  “It has been proven time and again that the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century,” Xi said in his keynote speech.  Building a world that enjoys universal security is a shared aspiration of people in all countries. Humanity is living in an indivisible security community, and countries must explore a path that ensures security for all, by all and of all.  In order to maintain peace and stability in the world, countries must adhere to the correct security vision. The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi stressed that it is important that all countries stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security.    Photo shows a view of the sub-forum on energy development of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, which kicked off in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province, on April 20, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  The security vision, which has rich connotations, lays emphasis on respecting and ensuring the security of each and every country, upholding security in both traditional and non-traditional fields, promoting the security of both individual countries and broader regions through dialogue and cooperation, and focusing on development and security so that security would be durable. It represents the core concept and laid a basic foundation for building a world that enjoys universal security.  Countries must abandon the outdated Cold War mentality if they want to maintain world peace and stability. Quite a number of the security issues today have been caused by certain countries’ pursuit of hegemonism and power politics.  The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi calls on countries to stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reject the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and say no to group politics and bloc confrontation; and stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, uphold the principle of indivisible security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the pursuit of one’s own security at the cost of others’ security.  Conforming to the historical trend toward economic globalization, multi-polarity in the world and democracy in international relations, the Global Security Initiative emphasizes that security is universal, equal, inclusive, and should be based on mutual respect between countries and the premise that all countries jointly uphold the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which sets forth specific principles at bilateral and multilateral levels for building a world that enjoys universal security.  Responsible actions must be taken so as to maintain peace and stability in the world. In today’s world, security means much more than before and its implications go well beyond a single region or time frame. All sorts of factors could have a bearing on a country’s security.    Aerial photo taken on April 12, 2022 shows the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) International Conference Center in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province.&nbsp;(People’s Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  The ways countries resolve differences and disputes and respond to various security threats determine the direction in which the international security situation develops.  The Global Security Initiative encourages countries to stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between them through dialogue and consultation, support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, reject double standards, and oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction; and stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and work together on regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity.  By stressing the importance of promoting security through dialogue and cooperation, taking a multi-pronged and holistic approach, and basing actions on the present situation while adopting a long-term perspective, the initiative offers feasible ideas for achieving long-term peace, stability and security in the world.

(Photo/Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Grenada)  Countries should follow a people-centered approach, place development and people’s well-being high on the agenda and advance practical cooperation in such key areas as poverty reduction, food security, development financing and industrialization, in a bid to address uneven and inadequate development, Xi pointed out, adding that China is working with the international community on the solid implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) he proposed last year.  Xi’s proposals demonstrate China’s sense of responsibility and unwavering commitment to advancing the global development cause and build a global community of development with a shared future.  “The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously eroded the gains the world has made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Uneven recovery is aggravating inequality across the world, further widening the North-South divide,” Xi noted.  The impacts of the Ukraine crisis have continued to spill over into more regions, putting more strain on the world economy, which has already faced with fragile and weak recovery.  Changes of the world, of the times and of history are posing severe challenges to the global development cause, which must be taken seriously by humanity.

(People’s Daily Online/Wei Jinsong)  The pandemic has resulted in the relapse of several emerging nations into poverty and instability. Numerous people in developed countries are also living through a hard time due to the pandemic.  “Safety and health are the prerequisite for human development and progress,” Xi said, emphasizing the need of countries supporting each other, better coordinating response measures and improving global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic.  More than 10 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally, but about 83 percent of Africa’s population has yet to receive a single dose. The top priority for countries at the moment is to close the immunization gap.  China has honored its commitment to making Chinese COVID vaccines a global public good and tried to ensure their accessibility and affordability in developing countries, according to Xi. The country has provided over 2.1 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations, and will follow through the pledged donation of 600 million and 150 million doses of vaccines to Africa and ASEAN countries respectively.  The global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted; commodity prices continue to climb; and energy supply remains tight. These risks amplify one another and exacerbate the uncertainties surrounding economic recovery.  The global low inflation environment has notably changed, and the risks of inflation driven by multiple factors are surfacing. If major economies slammed on the brakes or took a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability.  Xi urged countries to increase macro policy coordination, turn to science and technology for more growth drivers, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and prevent serious negative spillovers from policy adjustments in some countries to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development.  In the planet that we call home, humankind shares the same future. Only by staying on top of the dominant trend of economic globalization and adhering to the times' tendency of peace, development and win-win cooperation can human beings jointly surmount difficulties and embrace a brighter future.  True development is development for all and good development is sustainable. The entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the completion and operation of the China-Laos Railway have effectively improved regional “hard connectivity” of infrastructure and “soft connectivity” of rules and standards, demonstrating how win-win cooperation between countries drives development.、    Photo taken on April 17, 2022 shows national flags of various counties fluttering in the wind at the Qionghai Boao Airport in Boao township, south China’s Hainan province, host township of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People’s Daily Online/Meng Zhongde)  China has actively pressed ahead with high-quality Belt and Road cooperation for high-standard, sustainable and people-centered growth, injecting strong impetus into the sustainable development of countries along the routes of the initiative. The GDI proposed by China has been echoed and supported by the United Nations and other international organizations and nearly 100 countries. These are convincing evidence of China’s efforts to promote the global development cause in pursuit of win-win results.  As the Ukraine crisis continues to escalate, geopolitical factors are encumbering global economic recovery and further disrupting the global development cause; developing countries are bearing the brunt of the effects.  China has persisted in promoting peace talks and stressed that all parties should create the necessary environment and conditions for advancing peace talks. This is a decision made by the country not only for world peace and security, but for global development.  “A review of human history teaches us that the more difficult things get, the greater the need grows to stay confident,” Xi pointed out. China will continue to join hands with various countries and create tremendous synergy through win-win cooperation to together overcome various roadblocks along the way, promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development, and push forward the global development cause.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

A fundamental solution is to accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all relevant parties,” pointed out Chinese President Xi Jinping when meeting via video link with President Charles Michel of the European Council and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission on the evening of April 1.  By advocating the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, China has played a constructive role in easing the tensions between Russia and Ukraine.  In today’s world where economic globalization is enjoying intensive development, all countries share weal and woe and a common future, and no country in the world can enjoy absolute security.  Under such new circumstances, the implications of security go far beyond the security based on confrontation and balance of power during the Cold War, but show more interconnectedness and diversity.  A new security situation in the world calls for a new vision of security. “We need to keep pace with the changing circumstances and evolving times. One cannot live in the 21st century with the outdated thinking from the age of Cold War and zero-sum game. We believe that it is necessary to advocate common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security in Asia,” Xi said at the fourth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia in 2014.  Since then, the Chinese leader has continuously expounded on and developed this security outlook to facilitate the adoption of a new security vision in line with the trend of the times by the international community, which fully demonstrates China’s sincere desire to strengthen global security governance.  The vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security is based on profound insights into the experience and lessons learned by human society in dealing with security issues and focused on the goal of long-term peace, stability and security of the world. It has injected new and rich connotations into global security governance.  Common security means respecting and ensuring the security of each and every country involved. Security is a two-way and interconnected issue, Xi said at the opening ceremony of the 86th Interpol General Assembly in 2017. It is inadvisable for a country to care only about its own security in total disregard of the security of others and seek the so-called absolute security of itself at the expense of the security of others, such practice would end up hurting oneself.  Comprehensive security means upholding security in both traditional and non-traditional fields. As traditional security threats and non-traditional ones are intertwined, only by introducing a multi-pronged and comprehensive policy can countries effectively deal with various security challenges.  Cooperative security means promoting the security of both individual countries and the region as a whole through dialogue and cooperation. As a Kazakh proverb goes, “One who tries to blow out other’s oil lamp will get his beard on fire”, which is a vivid reflection of the current reality. Countries must abandon the zero-sum game mentality and promote peace and security through cooperation.  Sustainable security means that the countries involved need to focus on both development and security to realize durable security. Only by paying attention to development deficit behind security deficit can countries consolidate the foundations for security and address both symptoms and root causes of security issues.  The Ukrainian crisis has made the world realize that in this day and age, global and regional security frameworks should no longer be built with Cold War mentality.  To promote a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and the resumption of peace, China has continuously promoted peace talks, stressed that a fundamental solution to the crisis is to accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all relevant parties, and supported the establishment of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism.  China’s constructive stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict demonstrates its sense of responsibility as a major country in practicing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and persisting in world peace construction.  However, the NATO led by the U.S. has sought its own security at the expense of the security of other countries and regions and pursued regional security by expanding a military bloc with Cold War mentality, posing the biggest threat to international security.  The Ukraine crisis has revealed to the world that real security requires joint construction and sharing, rather than forming a small circle to keep others out by exaggerating security threats.  At present, the world is neither tranquil nor stable. The prevailing trend of peace and development is facing serious challenges. Therefore, upholding and practicing a correct security vision becomes a matter of great urgency.  China will stick to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and join hands with other countries to strengthen global security governance, address various security challenges, and make unremitting efforts to build a world of lasting peace and universal security. &nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

The report reveals the dark history and harsh reality of the racial discrimination against Asians in the U.S. society, emphasizing that Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans are subject to discrimination and violations in various forms, and cannot fully enjoy their human rights.  It claims that the increasing racial discrimination against Asians exposes the country’s fundamental racist nature.  Some U.S. politicians and media outlets are reluctant to acknowledge the racial discrimination against Asian Americans, but massive incidents are telling the truth that such discrimination is getting severer.  According to a survey released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB), hate crime cases in the U.S. decreased by 7 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, but those against Asian Americans increased by 149 percent.  According to a report published on Nov. 18, 2021 by the national coalition Stop Asian American and Pacific Islander Hate, from March 19, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, a total of 10,370 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander people were reported to the organization, with the majority of the incidents took place in public spaces such as public streets and businesses.  Statistics released by the New York City Police Department on Dec. 8, 2021 showed that anti-Asian hate crimes in the city rose by 361 percent from that of 2020.  There’s a Chinese saying that it takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in March 2021 that "Thousands of incidents across the past year have perpetuated a centuries-long history of intolerance, stereotyping, scapegoating, exploitation and abuse."  Discrimination on a systematic basis is akin to a long-standing malignancy in the United States. In the late 19th century, some politicians and media deliberately stigmatized Asian Americans as "Yellow Peril," and in 1924, all Asians were forbidden to immigrate to the U.S.  Asian Americans have suffered from long-time prejudice, exclusion, and racial violence. The Associated Press once observed that "Racism against Asian Americans has long been an ugly thread in the U.S. history."  In recent years, U.S. politicians have poisoned the U.S. society through political manipulation, which made the racial discrimination against Asians even more rampant. They politicized, labeled and stigmatized the virus, further exacerbating the discrimination against Asian Americans.  White House press secretary admitted that there was "no question" that the former U.S. administration's "damaging rhetoric" led to "elevated threats against Asian Americans." In September 2020, 164 Republican congressmen voted against the bill condemning discrimination against Asian Americans.  Unfortunately, the current U.S. government proceeded to manipulate the public opinion and politicize the COVID-19 origins tracing, further stoking the Anti-Asian sentiments within the U.S. Deceived by some U.S. politicians' and media's lies about the coronavirus pandemic, some African Americans mistook Asian Americans as their enemy and attacked Asian Americans to vent their anger. What the U.S. politician did has further indulged the racial discrimination against Asian Americans.  The increasing racial discrimination against Asians reflects a mindset of the U.S.: bullying the weak, which comes from the “white supremacy” environment. The U.S. government and society have long turned a deaf ear to Asian Americans' complaints of racism and discrimination. The U.S. has never compensated for or reflected on the sufferings it has inflicted on Asian Americans, and even tries its best to cover up or blur relevant facts.  In the U.S., Asian Americans are portrayed as outsiders in racial conflicts. Such identification of Asian Americans in the U.S. makes them the target of racist exclusion. Numerous vicious violent attacks against Asian Americans have gone unfiled as hate crimes. After the three shootings that occurred in Atlanta on March 16, 2021, the spokesman of the local police office openly denied that it was a hate crime and even defended the shooter by claiming that he was having a "bad day." Being labeled as a "permanent alien" is a traumatic experience shared by many Asian Americans, said BBC in a report.  The cold reality reflects that Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans are subject to discrimination and violations in various forms, despite the fact that they have made prominent contributions to the progress of the U.S. society and that the ethnic composition of the United States is changing.  The poor records of the U.S. on racial problems mirror the deep-rooted institutional and structural deficits of the U.S. society, profoundly reveal the hypocrisy of the “American human rights,” and debunk the so-called “beacon of human rights.”  (Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People’s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  The U.S. has thoroughly exposed its hypocrisy and double standards on human rights issues by staging farce of politicizing human rights issues year after year while turning a blind eye to the continuous deterioration of its own human rights situation.  On April 12, the U.S. Department of State issued the so-called annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2021. The report filled with lies and prejudice pointed fingers at the human rights situation of nearly 200 countries and regions around the world, and, just like its predecessors released in previous years did, discredited and smeared China on issues including those related to northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and southwest China’s Tibet autonomous region.  A U.S. politician recently claimed that there has been “an alarming recession of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights in many parts of the world.” As a matter of fact, it is the U.S. that should reflect on the recession of its democracy and human rights situation more than any other country.  The January 2021 Capitol Hill attack has revealed to the world the reality of American democracy disorder.  A national public opinion poll of America’s 18- to 29-year-olds showed that 52 percent of the respondents believed that the American democracy was “in trouble” or “failing,” and only 7 percent of the surveyed young Americans viewed the U.S. as a “healthy democracy”, according to an article published on the website of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School on Dec. 1, 2021.  “While President Biden is hosting a global democracy summit, our own democracy right here is falling apart,” an article in USA Today quoted Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a voting rights group, as saying.  “The United States must first lead by example and address its own failings,” the article said.  U.S. President Joe Biden should be “entirely honest about the grave problems in his own country’s democracy”, according to an article published in American magazine The National Interest, which stressed that “democratic standards should apply to everyone, and are not just a vocabulary that the powerful use to lecture the weak.”  While repeatedly hyping up lies including the false allegations of the so-called “genocide” and “forced labor” in Xinjiang, politicians in the U.S. chose to forget their country’s disgraceful records in history as well as at present, including the slaughter of Indians, forced labor, and appalling prisoner abuse at black sites set up by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) all over the world.  The U.S. has a long and dark history of violating the rights of indigenous people, including Indians, who have experienced bloody massacres, brutal expulsions and cultural genocide.  Under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the actions of the U.S. constitute genocide, pointed out The Washington Post.  The U.S. has been faced with serious problems of human trafficking and forced labor. In the past five years, up to 100,000 people have been trafficked into the U.S. for forced labor annually.  The reality is slavery never ended in America, said an article published on the website of Richmond Times-Dispatch, the major daily newspaper in Richmond, Virginia.  The U.S. has set up black sites in at least 54 countries and regions around the world under the pretext of “War on Terror”, and secretly put the alleged terrorist suspects under arbitrary detention and extorted confessions by torture. About 100,000 people have been detained, and the detainees include Muslims, females and children. These black sites are ironclad evidence of America’s willful trampling on the rule of law and violation of human rights.  The U.S. should really make efforts to alleviate its deteriorating human rights situation, instead of making indiscreet remarks on the human rights situation of other countries.  Over the past more than two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. has reported a cumulative total of more than 80 million confirmed cases and nearly one million deaths from the virus, while the average life expectancy in the country fell by 1.13 years, becoming the world’s No. 1 anti-pandemic failure.  The combined assets of the richest one percent of Americans were nearly 16 times that of the poorest 50 percent, and the gap between rich and poor has been aggravated, according to the Report on the Economic Well-Being of the U.S. Households in 2020 released by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the U.S.  The “virus” of deeply-entrenched racism in the U.S. has been spreading along with the novel coronavirus, with racial economic divide increasingly widening and racial inequality continuously growing.  Gun violence has been on the rise in the U.S. At least 10,362 people were killed by gun violence in the U.S. in the first three months of 2022, and an average of more than 115 people in the country lose their lives to gun violence every day.  In March 2021, during the review of the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review of the U.S. by the 46th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, many countries pointed out that the human rights situation in the U.S. was terrible and urged the country to immediately stop human rights violations in all forms and take practical measures to avoid further deterioration of human rights situation.  By politicizing and weaponizing human rights issues, the U.S. has wantonly interfered in the internal affairs of other countries and maintained its hegemony under the pretext of human rights.  In recent years, the rise in China’s comprehensive national strength has given some politicians in the U.S. the “anxiety disorder”. Sticking to the Cold War mentality, these politicians have racked their brains to play zero-sum games and use democracy and human rights as tools to smear China and whitewash their own hegemonic acts.  The so-called human rights advocated by the U.S. government are not in the least related to the genuine concept and that the country only takes advantage of the banner of human rights to advance its global strategy, said James Peck, adjunct instructor with New York University in History and East Asia Departments.  Democracy is by no means the prerogative of a few nations, and should not become a tool used by one country to put pressure on other countries and engage in political blackmail.  The U.S. has acted against the trend of history and intensified efforts to promote politicization of human rights issues in a bid to safeguard its hegemonic interests, seriously hindering the sound development of global human rights cause.  The U.S. government should immediately stop fabricating the so-called Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and concentrate its energies on facing up to and improving its own human rights situation.

In the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union was heading straight toward its sudden dissolution, leaders from NATO member states rushed to do their calculations. Should the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which had been built upon the premise of countering the Soviet superpower, also become history with the demise of its raison d'être? Some pondered. But still, a host of politicians from NATO member states cautioned against its abolishment and argued that, even after the Soviet Union collapsed, the need to "preserve the strategic balance in Europe" still remained. It was with the belief of swapping Europe's strategic autonomy with the ostensible "strategic balance" that NATO offered, a bygone concept from the Cold War-era reemerged and eventually widened its scope in a new century, and instead of shrinking or fading away it has instead expanded, incorporating more and more Central and Eastern European nations into its membership.  NATO, Asian edition?  NATO's ambition and appetite have never been just confined to the Trans-Atlantic, as hardly had the Iron Curtain ceased to exist when NATO began to involve itself in wars of regime-change and invasions into Iraq and Afghanistan. In recent years the Western military alliance has also been rising in strength at an alarming rate, spreading its tentacles further to reach regions in Asia. High-level officials from Japan, South Korea, India, and Australia (with the latter, strictly speaking, simply being a nation that happens to be adjacent to Asia), among others, all being non-NATO states, and have long been frequently invited to join NATO meetings (including the one that was held earlier this month), at which NATO has spared no efforts to exercise its "long-arm jurisdiction" over issues such as the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.  Since the simmering tension between Russia and Ukraine (the latter has been keen to join NATO despite the former's fierce objection) escalated into a deadly war, Washington, the de facto leader of NATO, has grown increasingly active in preaching about the alliance's significance. Not only have senior US officials turned their global visits into opportunities for the special promotion of NATO, but they have also repeatedly cited the so-called "China threat" and "Ukraine lesson" as excuses to urge military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region to be further cemented and bolstered. In a flurry of meetings and phone calls after the eruption of the Ukraine conflict, US president Joe Biden praised the "supportive" role of the Quad, an alliance between the US, India, Japan, and Australia, while reassuring the bloc's partners of Washington's commitment to supporting Australia with nuclear submarines and other advanced weaponry (such as hypersonic weapons) under AUKUS, a trilateral pact between the US, UK, and Australia.  Whatever intentions Washington may harbor—whether integrating more Asian nations into the already loaded roster of the NATO alliance, or duplicating and nurturing more NATO replica or quasi-NATO intergovernmental organizations around the world—they will surely be equally NA(o)TO-rious and hazardous, both militarily and economically.    Cold War schemer Cartoon: Xu Zihe/GT  A security mirage  To begin with, Washington's attempts to build a NATO replica organization—or, as many are calling it, an "Asian NATO"—will only serve to sabotage regional security and stability instead of "promoting" these goals.  Through bilateral security treaties and multilateral defense alliances like the Quad and AUKUS, Washington has for years laboriously weaved its so called Indo-Pacific "collective defense web" into something akin to that of NATO, all at the expense of the common peace and stability shared by the entire region.  But the idea of seeking "collective security" through "collective defense" doesn't hold water because Washington's strategy by nature is hostile and "coercive," which is exactly what Barry Blechman has written and argued, an American scholar focusing on nuclear disarmament, in his 2020 book Military Coercion and US Foreign Policy.  Holding the banner of bloc politics and power politics, the US has relentlessly borrowed coercive and hegemonic tactics from its Cold War toolbox: stationing its omnipresent troops, deploying defensive systems, conducting joint naval exercises, and selling lethal weapons. All of these tactics, however, only serve to create a mirage of security, one that is parochial, unsustainable and can fail at any time (As Blechman pointed out, during the post-Cold War period US efforts to coerce other states failed as often as they succeeded).  Take the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula as an example. Washington has always acted as the major player on the issue, and with its perilous moves, the US has sometimes grabbed the limelight away from even the ROK and DPRK themselves. In 2016, Washington announced that it would deploy THAAD, an anti-ballistic missile defense system, in South Korea, against vehement protests from countries within the region and from South Koreans. This omnipotent but unnecessary defense system was combined with a bombardment of sanctions and unrelenting joint military exercises. This shows that Washington has utilized every coercive device at its disposal despite the crisis having become even more convoluted and insoluble in recent years.  Washington's military presence in the region has not only given rise to on-and-off tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but the US army itself has also been muddling the otherwise pacific and stable state of the region. Its spy planes have continued hovering and buzzing over sensitive waters, its ships and vessels have continued cruising in an often provocative manner, and one of its nuclear submarines was met with a collision in the South China Sea.  Setting NATO as an exemplar, Washington is bent on constructing a hostile and turbulent climate, where any sense of security and stability is exclusive to only those nations living under its military umbrella. The ongoing Ukraine conflict has offered the world a wake-up call that NATO's eastern expansion and growing coercion is no solution for peace, on the contrary, it was only the prelude to a shattered peace and a disrupted "strategic balance" in Europe. This scenario is exactly what the nations in Asia should act to prevent. For the Asia-Pacific region, an "Asian NATO," even in its embryonic form, will be destined to heighten military risks, create more turmoil, and risk draging the entire region into Washington's insatiable gambit for geopolitical clout and hegemony.    Australian doublespeak Illustration: Liu Rui/GT  A lose-lose trap  For years, China's peaceful rise and its dynamic trade ties with countries in Asia and beyond have become a thorn in Washington's side. Under the disguise of its "overarching" Indo-Pacific strategy, the US is utilizing military alliances to kidnap economic ties in the region, creating a lose-lose trap that no nation, except the US, wants to see.  The souring China-Australia relationship is the perfect case study of how Washington's bloc politics can take a toll on bilateral relations—and economic ties in particular—in the region of Asia and beyond.  China stands as Australia's largest trading partner, having imported approximately USD 164.8 billion worth of Australian goods last year, according to statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China. By comparison, the US imported only around USD 12.5 billion worth of goods from Australia in 2021.  With Australia's trade axis leaning clearly towards one direction, Aussie leaders are still somehow convinced of the merits in shifting their foreign policies in another direction. Since the second half of 2020, Australia has joined Washington's call to smear China with baseless accusations, interfere in China's domestic affairs, and hype up the so-called "China threat," all against growing domestic concerns raised in Australia's frenzied anti-China rhetoric, stoked on by the US. This may fray the China-Australia relationship, one that Scott Morrison, Australian prime minister, has acknowledged as "valuable."  A possible Asian NATO may reflect part of Washington's efforts to resuscitate its "Pivot to Asia" strategy, but Asian nations' common interests have never revolved around the US: they remain deeply intertwined and deeply rooted in Asia.  Vibrant regional intergovernmental organizations in Asia like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), together with promising free trade agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which consists of the 10 members in ASEAN, plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, can serve as a strong indication that peace and development are still being prioritized and cherished and that multilateralism and cooperation can still prevail over bloc politics and confrontation.    (Cartoon by Ma Hongliang)  The world is not a land divided by different ideological lines or carved by different camps, awaiting Washington and the US military's alliances to conquer or deter enemies. In times of conflict and turmoil, we should all do more to cherish peace, a peace that is consolidated through common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security rather than sustained by pressure politics or Cold War-like power equilibriums. An "Asian NATO," by its nature, goes against the peace as we know it and will inevitably impair the stability and prosperity of the region. If anything, it is beneficial—only for its architect, the US itself.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Its despicable act constitutes gross infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of its neighboring countries, severe breach of international justice and its obligations under international law, and major threat to the marine environment and the right to health of people around the world.  On April 13, 2021, the Japanese government unilaterally decided to dump a massive amount of nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) into the ocean despite doubts and opposition from home and abroad.  One year has passed since Japan announced the erroneous decision and the country still hasn’t realized how terrible a mistake it is. According to a plan recently released by TEPCO for the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water generated by Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the country will soon begin official preparations for the release of the contaminated water and plans to begin long-term discharge of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean in the spring of 2023.  While Japan opted for the discharge of the contaminated water into the ocean, an option with the least economic cost to itself, it posed the biggest environmental health and safety risk to the world. What an act of selfish calculation!  Data from TEPCO showed that the contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear accident still contains many kinds of radionuclides with a long half-life even after secondary treatment.  Japan plans to release more than one million tons of nuclear-contaminated water over a period of 30 years. The amount it intends to discharge, the duration of the release, the sea area covered, and potential risks that can be generated by the activity are all unprecedented.  The decision has aroused deep concerns and strong opposition from all sectors of society even at home. About 180,000 people in Japan recently signed a petition against the decision to dump nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. Several organizations in Japan, including the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, have reiterated their opposition to the decision.  According to an article published on Fukushima Minpo, a newspaper based in Fukushima prefecture of Japan, the Japanese government should respect the opinions of its citizens, listen to the voices of local residents, and terminate the plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean.  As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, Japan has knowingly breached its obligations under international law.  It didn’t conduct full consultation with its neighboring countries and other stakeholders before announcing its decision to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. After its announcement of the decision, many countries, including China, South Korea, Russia, and the Philippines, as well as relevant international institutions, have expressed concerns over the issue and raised doubts and concerns with the Japanese side over the legitimacy of the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, the rationality of the discharge plan, the credibility of data about the nuclear contaminated water and the reliability of the equipment to purify the nuclear-contaminated water.  However, to this day, Japan has yet to give a full and credible explanation for its decision and serious responses to relevant doubts and concerns.  People in Japan's neighboring countries and countries on the Pacific Rim have rights to health and life as well as the environment. Japan, on the other hand, wants to make short-term money at the expense of these rights.  The United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council released a report urging that the Japanese government should face up to its responsibility for the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water.  In a joint statement, U.N. human rights experts said that Japan’s decision to release contaminated water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean is “particularly disappointing” and “very concerning”.  “The release of one million tons of contaminated water into the marine environment imposes considerable risks to the full enjoyment of human rights of concerned populations in and beyond the borders of Japan,” they said in the joint statement.  The international community has frequently expressed voices of justice, such as “The Pacific is not a dumping ground for radioactive waste water” and “keep our Pacific nuclear-free”. However, Japan has turned a deaf ear to all of them.  In this February, a technical working group of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Japan for the first time and raised many questions to the Japanese side about its controversial plan to release radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. Evaluation of the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima nuclear power plant is still in progress.  Surprisingly, Japan has not only ignored the concerns of various parties over the discharge of its nuclear-contaminated wastewater, but preset results for the evaluation conducted by the IAEA technical working group. The country repeatedly concealed information and covered up the truth.  When doubts about its decision to dump radioactive water into the ocean poured in, the country made no attempt to reflect on the legitimacy of the decision and correct its mistake, but blamed those who doubted its decision for damaging its reputation.  The Japanese side should know that no matter what it does to whitewash the plan to release the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, it would only increase the international community’s concerns.  The disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water is never Japan’s private matter. Instead, it bears on the marine environment and public health of the whole world.  Japan should pay careful attention to and respond to the concerns of its neighboring countries and other members of the international community, stop pushing forward with preparations for the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, and withdraw its erroneous decision, so as to avoid further damage to its credibility.

In his speech, Biden spent considerable time discussing the victory of Western countries, including the U.S. in the Cold War and tried to play up ideological confrontation, attempting to show the world the so-called solidarity between the U.S. and its allies and the deterrent effect of the economic sanctions and military deployment of the “Western world”.  U.S. President talked about practically everything in his speech, but only failed to mention how to stop the war and realize peace, indicating that certain U.S. politicians have never abandoned their Cold War mentality even though the Cold War ended more than 30 years ago, some media outlets pointed out.  The Russia-Ukraine tensions have evolved into a war exactly as a pernicious consequence of America’s sticking to the Cold War mentality and continuously pushing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) eastward.  According to British scholar Martin Jacques, the U.S.’s post-1991 hubris resulted in two disastrous decisions: to remake the world in its own image; and to treat Russia as a defeated nation.  The U.S. has promoted NATO’s enlargement through five rounds of eastward expansion, leading to seriously imbalanced regional security. As a result, Ukraine, which should have been the bridge of communication between the East and the West, was gradually transformed into an outpost for major powers confrontation.  George Kennan, former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, pointed out that the decision to expand NATO up to Russia’s borders “would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era” and may be expected to “restore the atmosphere of the Cold War to East-West relations”.  Today, as Ukraine remains mired in turmoil and the embers of conflict rekindle on the European continent, facts prove again that the Cold War mentality is the greatest threat to global peace and stability.  Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. has pursued its geopolitical goal with a Cold War mentality, rather than fostering peace negotiations. The country, which believes that it can exploit the Ukraine crisis to provoke ideological confrontation and deepen Europe’s dependence on America, has been enthusiastically escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, fanning the flames of discord, and forcing other countries into taking sides.  Besides taking aim at Russia, the U.S. has also continued to propagate disinformation to defame China and misrepresented China’s responsible stance on the Ukraine issue: promoting dialogue and peace talks.  As Iliya Kusa, a political analyst with the Ukrainian Institute of the Future, pointed out, China has played a constructive role in the Ukraine crisis, while the U.S. is still focusing its attention on what it can do to weaken China.  Although the U.S. has frequently claimed that it does not seek a “new Cold War”, the country has taken advantage of any chance to suppress China and Russia. Regarding the two countries as its top strategic competitors, it has made arrangements to gain at their expense.  Obviously, America’s insistence on the outdated Cold War mentality is the root cause of the escalation of regional and global security tensions.  “I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe, but it’s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it’s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing,” said Biden during his visit to Europe. The remarks exposed the true colors of the U.S., a hypocrite that stops at nothing to create crises, shift its burden of crises onto others, and utilize crises to maintain its hegemony.  As the world’s major exporter of natural gas and oil, the U.S. can certainly put on sanctified airs and understate the consequences of obstructing the supply of Russian natural gas, for it does not have to suffer the consequences.  Though the U.S. promised to ensure supply of natural gas to Europe, its allies, after learning how unreliable and untrustworthy it can be from lessons in the past, have deep concerns over its strategic purpose behind the promise.  The origin of the Russia-Ukraine conflict lies in NATO, and Europe would only get hurt if it waded into muddy water with the U.S., noted Klaus Ernst, a senior member of the German federal parliament.  The Ukraine crisis has helped various sides see clearer how harmful the Cold War mentality can be. As a well-known quote from Albert Einstein goes, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”  Since the deep-seated Cold War mentality of the U.S. is the root cause of the Ukraine crisis, the country will only make it more difficult to solve problems for the current crisis as long as it still sticks to the mentality.  As a Chinese saying goes, “He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off.” In order to settle the Ukraine crisis, relevant countries must discard the Cold War mentality, the attempt to maintain their own security at the cost of others’ security, and the practice of pursuing regional security by expanding military blocs. Instead, they should seek the establishment of a balanced, effective, and sustainable European security mechanism through dialogues and negotiations on the basis of attaching importance to and respecting the legitimate security concerns of various countries.  The U.S. needs to realize sooner rather than later that the Cold War is over, and a “new Cold War” will not get any support.  The world wants peace, justice, and cooperation, rather than war, hegemony, and confrontation. If the U.S. truly wants to de-escalate the tensions between Russia and Ukraine, it should face its responsibility for the current situation in Ukraine, stop pursuing selfish gains from the crisis, respond to the legitimate concerns of all parties, and take practical steps toward world peace.

(Photo/Yin Bogu)  Chinese President Xi Jinping met via video link with President Charles Michel of the European Council and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission in Beijing on the evening of April 1.  Providing guidance and charting a course for the healthy and sustained relationship between China and Europe, President Xi stressed that China and the EU should act as two major forces upholding world peace, two big markets promoting shared development, and two great civilizations promoting human progress. He also shared his views on how to settle the Ukraine crisis under the current circumstances.  When President Xi paid a historic visit to the EU headquarters in March 2014, he suggested that China and Europe work together to foster a China-EU partnership for peace, growth, reform and civilization, which has endowed the China-Europe comprehensive strategic partnership with new connotations.  This vision remains unchanged today and is of practical significance under the current circumstances. As the world has entered a period of new turbulence and transformation, China and the EU should offset uncertainties in the international landscape with the stability of China-EU relations, deepen economic globalization through open cooperation, and meet global challenges through solidarity and collaboration.  China and the EU are two major independent forces that share broad strategic consensus and common interests. Dialogue and cooperation remain the mainstream of China-EU relations, and mutual benefit is the keynote of China-EU cooperation. It's a consensus between the two sides that they need peace, multilateralism and dialogue, instead of war, unilateralism, and confrontation.    Cooking utensils to be exported to the European and American markets are being assembled at a workshop of the Anhui Hualing Kitchen Equipment Co., Ltd. in Ma'anshan, east China's Anhui province, April 1, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Wang Wensheng)  China and the EU should perceive their relations from broader strategic and more profound historical perspectives. Xi said they should take the lead in defending the international system with the UN at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and jointly reject the resurrection of rival-bloc mentality and oppose attempts at a new Cold War, with a view to maintaining world peace and stability.  Xi called on the EU to form its own perception of China, adopt an independent China policy, and work with China to promote the steady and sustained growth of China-EU relations and to add stabilizing factors to a turbulent world.  China and the EU are important trading partners of each other. They carry out cooperation in a wide range of fields and their interests are interwoven.  China has remained the largest trading partner of the EU for two consecutive years, and the trade volume between the two sides reached a record high of more than $800 billion last year. The trade structure between them is constantly optimized, with prominent growth observed in aerospace, biology, optoelectronics, and electronics.  China's solid efforts to deepen reform and expand opening up have created important opportunities for European business investment. The China-EU agreement on geographical indications has further facilitated bilateral trade, and the China-Europe freight trains are also contributing to the stability of the international industrial and supply chains.  As two major economies, China and the EU enjoy strong resilience and huge potential in economic and trade cooperation. The cooperation between them is conducive to not only their own development, but also the economic recovery of the world.    A freight train bound for Madrid, Spain is ready to depart from Yiwu, east China's Zhejiang province, April 1, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Gong Xianming)  Facing increasing global challenges, China and the EU need to follow true multilateralism and advocate a vision of global governance featuring the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.  From jointly making important contributions to the reaching of the Paris Agreement to leading cooperation on biodiversity, and from offering mutual assistance in the fight against COVID-19 to further enhancing anti-pandemic cooperation for narrowing the global immunity gap, China and the EU enjoy a solid foundation in strengthening cooperation.  China welcomes the EU's support for and participation in the Global Development Initiative. The two sides' efforts to promote world peace, economic growth and common prosperity will contribute wisdom and strength to improving global governance.  Concerning regional and global peace and stability, the situation in Ukraine is receiving high attention from the international society. During the meeting with President Michel and President von der Leyen, President Xi called on the global community to encourage peace talks, prevent a humanitarian crisis on a bigger scale, foster lasting peace in Europe and the Eurasian continent, and prevent the regional conflict from magnifying. His proposals fully demonstrated China's major responsibility to always stand on the right side of history and play a constructive role in safeguarding world peace and the common interests of mankind.  Promoting peace talks, keeping the situation under control, preventing larger-scale humanitarian crisis and spillover of the Ukraine crisis are a consensus reached between China and the EU. Both of the two sides are unwilling to see the world divided, and oppose a new Cold War in any form.  There is no conflict of fundamental interests between China and the EU. Cooperation far outweighs competition, and consensus far outweighs disagreement. The two sides should maintain their mutual understanding, and adhere to mutual trust, dialogues and cooperation for win-win results, so as to make constant progress of China-EU relations, and make their contributions to world peace and development as two major forces, big markets and great civilizations.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  --Washington's relentless fanning the flames, shirking of responsibilities, and throwing of dirt have cast an ominous shadow on any possible de-escalation.  --Washington is&nbsp;wilfully&nbsp;driving the train of Ukraine's future not toward peace, but all speed ahead into a future riddled with more uncertainties and untold suffering.  In his high-stakes trip to Poland last week, US president Joe Biden was scheduled to meet with leaders from Europe to discuss the response to the "humanitarian and human rights crisis" arising from the over month-long Russia-Ukraine conflict. At least that was what a White House statement prior to Biden's visit read.  The response—it turned out—was a cascade of personal attacks targeting Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, together with an insinuation that the US would respond "in kind" if chemical weapons were deployed, and backtracking from his campaign promise to only use the US nuclear arsenal as a defensive last resort.  His flabbergasting remarks, which were described by many as a "gaffe," have drawn harsh criticism both at home and abroad. James Freeman, a Wall Street Journal columnist, half-jokingly commented that Americans would all be much safer if their president "would make greater use of prepared statements on subjects such as, for example, weapons of mass destruction." Even former US President Donald Trump, who is famous for his imprudent and often impromptu political language, slammed his successor's rhetoric as provocative.  European leaders have also expressed their deep concerns over Biden's fiery speech while distancing themselves from it. French President Emmanuel Macron, who in the past months had been busy mediating between Russia and Ukraine, expressed that such inflammatory rhetoric went against the joint efforts for a ceasefire and could possibly throw future negotiations into jeopardy.  Despite that high-level US officials have come forward several times to clarify that Washington harbored no intentions of using chemical weapons and sought no regime change in Russia, the international community, including American allies, has grown increasingly wary and confused with Washington's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  Is the US willing to help allay the tensions and deescalate the situation? Or is it determined to fuel the flames and incite even fiercer confrontations? Seen from Washington's inflammatory rhetoric and actions, it has apparently chosen the latter course.    (Cartoon by Ma Hongliang)  Quelling fires with fuel  Since the Ukraine conflict broke out over a month ago, the US has deployed over 12,000 troops to the periphery of Ukraine and pledged to send more armed forces to Eastern Europe. This week, when a knifes-edge peace talk was held between Russia and Ukraine, the general in charge of American forces in Europe hinted that the US would still need more troops in the region even after the Russia-Ukraine conflict begins to wane.  At a time when NATO's expansion, together with its defense budget hikes and military build-ups, served as a prelude to the seemingly irreconcilable Ukraine crisis, Washington has intended to reinforce the vicious circle, paving the way for yet more budget hikes, more military build-ups to maintain its extreme pressure on Russia that lies at the root of the crisis.  [Related Reading: Cold War-minded U.S. eyes more military spending to sustain hegemony amid geopolitical tensions]  As Tulsi Gabbard, a former US Congresswoman who once served in Iraq sharply and correctly pointed out, the crisis and suffering "could have easily been avoided if the Biden administration and NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border."  In a recent interview on Fox News, Gabbard reiterated her belief that Washington had purposely, as it always did, fanned the flames of the conflict instead of helping to mollify it. "The strategy and tactics are the same as our (America's) previous regime change wars: inflicting severe hardship and suffering on the population in order to incite revolt and chaos," she highlighted.  Washington has posed as an arbitrator, a peacekeeper in the Ukraine crisis, and a ballast of stability and security in Europe, but it has failed to acknowledge the culpable roles it played in the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the protracted instability of the region.  NATO's five waves of expansion, American and NATO leaders' luring Ukraine into the military alliance, together with NATO's growing military budgets and deployment of troops and defense systems near Russia's doorstep, have not only undermined the strategic autonomy of Europe, enticed paranoia and an unnecessary arms race (even a nuclear one) around the entire world, but also have given rise to disastrous scenarios like the Ukraine crisis that the US and NATO had purported to wish to prevent.  The US branded NATO as a shield, a stabilizer, as well as an umbrella, but it could never erase the military alliance's notorious record of unjustified bombings in Yugoslavia or its inglorious involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.  The US may feel complacent about a rare moment of unity among NATO member states, including the unparalleled military and economic clout it can wield, but as long as the crux of the crisis remains—Washington and NATO's overreaching and bellicose stance—then conflicts and suffering will persist. The US cannot expect to put up the fire with fuel.    Unmasking The Superpower: Vampires in the war Illustration: Xu Zihe/GT  Fishing in troubled waters  "People say the Pentagon does not have a strategy. They are wrong. The Pentagon does have a strategy. It is 'Don't interrupt the money flow, add to it,'" as so famously said by John Boyd, a former Pentagon consultant and military strategist during the second half of the last century.  America's motto of feeding on turmoil and profiting from conflicts, which was upheld during the Persian Gulf War, America's invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and its military interventions in Syria and Libya, etc., is still enshrined in the heart of the US military to this day and couldn't be more relevant and explanatory as regards Washington's stance on Ukraine.  The US may continue complaining about surging oil prices, but it can't deny that it is the nation—probably the sole nation—standing to gain from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  One needs to look no further than Wall Street. Even though the US market has, overall, ebbed and flowed with the developments of the Ukraine conflict, its defense stocks have risen significantly, especially upon hearing the news that Germany, along with other NATO member states, would massively hike their defense budgets, increases Washington had been eager to see for years.  Axon Enterprise, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, coupled with other US aerospace and weapons manufacturers, have seen strong performances and rosy outlooks with the unfolding Ukraine conflict. Lockheed Martin, the world's largest weapons manufacturer, registered a 25 percent increase since the beginning of this year. Boeing, which invests heavily in the defense industry, has predicted a 31 percent 12-month upside potential.  [Related Reading: U.S. arms companies make big fortune amid Russia-Ukraine conflict]  Wherever the Russia-Ukraine conflict may go, America's defense giants will undeniably make big bucks for the financial elites, much like they always do when America's war machine is ratcheted up globally, or when the US is busy handing over lethal weapons to intensify the tragedies of the Middle East or spell more trouble in the Asia-Pacific region.  Washington may again gamble on a geopolitical endgame from which it has little to lose and much to gain, but with its dangerous and reckless words and deeds, it has also dragged Ukraine and Russia, with the latter being a nuclear power, toward the cliff of a more brutal confrontation, a scenario where there is no turning back.    (Cartoon by Ma Hongliang)  Throwing dirt  American politicians and media outlets, almost in tandem with the Ukraine conflict, have continued circulating and spewing out anti-China disinformation that is simply fake.  Starting earlier last month, the New York Times, joined by other mainstream media outlets, falsely claimed that Chinese officials had "known" beforehand about Russia's plans for the conflict. Their evidence? An unsubstantiated "Western intelligence report." Their source? Several unnamed officials. Apparently, America's disinformation machine has never once run out of steam with the same fuel.  Less than two weeks later, American media outlets cooked up something richer and even more fantastical. This time, they cited a US intelligence official who suggested that China "has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance," as CNN reported. To even consider giving an official response to such a pure fabrication was not worth the time. Yet, Chinese officials have on multiple occasions shown their utmost patience in debunking the flagrant and sinister lies of the Americans.  Then, last month, the New York Times published a preposterous analytical article headlined "China Takes a Back Seat in International Diplomacy Over Ukraine," in which it suggested that "China has repeatedly called for peace talks in Ukraine," while adding that "What it has not done is press Russia to negotiate." It is somewhat of a relief to see that the Times used the word "negotiate" instead of "sanction." But their tone seems to suggest that China somehow has a greater ability to sway Russia or press the "stop" button on the conflict than either the US and most of its Western allies combined might have.  In the American media's warped narratives on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US is whitewashed as a mediator, a peacekeeper, and a savior who protects the vulnerable from utter despair, while China is blackwashed as the nation that "stands aloof," "waits and sees," and hesitates to "act."  But in reality, China's stance on Ukraine has been consistent and clear-cut from the outset: it seeks to promote peace talks rather than carry out indiscriminate sanctions or set up obstacles for possible de-escalation; it acts to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine instead of supplying lethal weapons; it strives to foster lasting peace in Europe and the Eurasian continent rather than get stuck in the Cold War mentality and remain obsessed with expanding geopolitical clouts and forging military alliances.  On the contrary, America's sanctions stick and bellicose rhetoric are only worsening the situation, narrowing the window for a possible clawback from escalation, and steering Ukraine and Russia away from the negotiating table.    Peace talks Illustration: Liu Rui/GT  ***  As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its seventh week, the international community is counting on the hard-won yet fragile peace talks between the two sides. But Washington's relentless fanning the flames, shirking of responsibilities, and throwing of dirt have cast an ominous shadow on any possible de-escalation. As the driver that caused multiple train wrecks in the past, Washington is wilfully driving the train of Ukraine's future not toward peace, but all speed ahead into a future riddled with more uncertainties and untold suffering.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Russia accused the U.S. of violating the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in Ukraine, while the U.S. denied it and claimed it was based on fabricated evidence given by the Kremlin.  It is no secret that the U.S. hosts the most bio-military activities in the world, and is the only country that opposes the establishment of a verification mechanism for the BWC.  The activities of U.S. biological laboratories matter to the security of global biological safety. However, the White House's response to this grave worry has been denial. It has never offered any valuable or convincing information. Such perfunctory and arrogant response has further exacerbated worldwide society's concerns about the safety of U.S. bio-military actions.  Overseas bio-military activities are a tradition of the U.S. After the end of the Cold War, the country initiated the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program promoted by Richard Lugar and other U.S. senators. The White House claimed that the Soviet Union would be the first to "benefit" from the program, and then the benefits would expand to other parts of the world. Later, hundreds of laboratories were established under the CTR program.  The program, a gigantic bio-military empire, never ceased to cause scandals. Some of the labs reported leakage of highly dangerous pathogens that led to outbreaks of strange diseases, and some collected biological samples of local residents and transferred the samples to the U.S. and its allies for "studies." Many of these labs were poorly managed. Personnel sent by the U.S. Department of Defense had extraterritoriality and diplomatic immunity, so they could always get away with crimes at these labs.  After the U.S.-controlled bio-labs in Ukraine were exposed, the White House tried to vindicate itself with some materials. However, the U.S. doesn't have an innocent history of the development and employment of biological weapons at all.  The U.S. once covered up Shiro Ishii, director of the notorious Japanese Army Unit 731, and other war criminals, so as to make them develop biological weapons for itself. In the Korean War, the U.S. military launched undifferentiated germ warfare against Chinese and Korean forces and even civilians. In Vietnam, the U.S. military used the highly toxic Agent Orange on the battleground, killing and disabling millions of Vietnamese. The U.S. even forced thousands of soldiers into biological medicine tests. These are all evidence of the U.S. poisoning the world.  Former Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari of Indonesia once shut down the lab of the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit-2 during her term. She said the lab didn't make any contribution to Indonesia's capability in coping with biological threats and the studies were not submitted to the Indonesian government. She remarked that establishing laboratories on the territory of an independent country is a kind of colonialism.  The U.S. always takes "cooperating to reduce biological safety risks" as an excuse. However, only the U.S. itself knows whether it is really cooperating and whether it is reducing or increasing the risks.  Recently, a large demonstration was staged in South Korea, requesting the shutdown of U.S. military biological labs established in the country and calling for immediate investigations into these labs. The outrage of the South Koreans came from the United States Forces Korea, which has ignored South Korean laws and regulations and sent poisonous substances to South Korea, including Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis. These labs have caused frequent safety accidents, posing huge threats to the lives of South Koreans. Some South Koreans said that the U.S. bio-labs were built for American interests, and are a misfortune for the countries where they are built.  The international society has every reason to know what the U.S. has done. In recent years, the United States has arbitrarily requested that biological weapons verifications be launched in other countries, wielding the big stick of sanctions and even launching military invasions. However, it is ironic that the U.S. is always tolerant of itself and strict with others. It's either arrogantly requesting other countries to stay out of its biological weapon business, or passing the buck to other countries, or just showing its colors and unjustly blaming other countries for "disseminating fake information."  Faced with the accusation from Russia this time, the White House is even acting as a "victim." Such typical American double standard once again exposed the hegemonic thinking of the U.S. It is a huge insult to the countries and people that have been poisoned by U.S. bio-military activities, and is irresponsible to the whole world.  As a response to the Russian accusation and the concerns of the international society, the U.S. should take its responsibility, vindicate itself and stop opposing the establishment of a verification mechanism for the BWC. .The country can never prove itself innocent of hegemony. Only by following international rules and accepting investigations can it give a clear explanation to the world, and that's what is supposed to be done by a major country.

Security Council approval and lasted for 78 days.  NATO’s war crime will never be forgotten by the Serbians, the Chinese, or the people in the rest of the world.  The U.S. and the NATO have waged a number of wars in the past decades, tearing countries and regions in different parts of the world apart. These wars demonstrated to all peace-loving people around the globe that the U.S., which is obsessed with Cold War mentality, as well as the U.S.-led NATO, is the biggest source of turbulences in the world.  Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the NATO has purported to be a guardian of peace, order and morality.. It positions itself as an ultimate decision-maker of international affairs, provokes confrontation, and threatens other countries to pick a side with sanctions, so as to reach its geostrategic goals.  However, it's self-evident who initiated the most ferocious international security conflict in the post-Cold War era. An international political analyst believes that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a result of U.S. conspiracies and interference.  According to a political dignitary, the conflict could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from among its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would increase regional instability.  The arbitrary decision of the U.S.-led NATO to move its so-called line of defense for collective security to the borders of Russia and Ukraine has directly turned down the opportunity to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict through negotiations and led to a war between the two countries.  "We say we're a peaceful nation. Why do our leaders always keep us at war?" That's a very good question once raised by The Washington Post in one of its articles.  The U.S. always talks about peace, but it is indeed marching along the opposite path - wars. It's a country that's addicted to wars, and the American history is exactly a history of wars, which is a fact recognized by the international society. It is indicated by the photos posted by many people on social media of how their countries look like after U.S. bombings, as well as the miserable stories of themselves and their families in the wars launched by the U.S.  According to U.S. website War History Online, America has been at war 93 percent of the time since it was founded in 1776. After the World War II, Uncle Sam extended the tentacles of interference to the whole world, and became even more unscrupulous after the Cold War ended. A study by professor Monica Duffy Toft of international politics at Tufts University showed that the U.S. was engaged in 46 military interventions from 1948 to 1991, and the number more than quadrupled to 188 between 1992 and 2017. It's fair to say that there was a trace of the country in almost every conflict that happened.  The U.S.-based magazine Foreign Policy once pointed out that the U.S. may feel an impulse to start a foreign war as long as it is deemed necessary, and as for the terrible humanitarian disasters resulting from these foreign wars, they will be borne by others.  American historian Alan Brinkley recorded in the book American History that during the Vietnam War, the U.S. military carpet-bombed Vietnamese villages, tore down buildings with bulldozers, and wiped out fields and forests with chemical agents, killing two million civilians and forced over three million refugees to flee their homes.  Furthermore, the U.S.-led NATO employed depleted uranium weapons, which are banned by international treaties, in bombing Yugoslavia, and caused long-term negative impacts on Serbia's environment and people's health. Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. successively launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, leading to regional turbulences and spillover of security threats.  According to Smithsonian, the official journal published by the Smithsonian Institution, the U.S. launched military actions in the name of "counter-terrorism" in around 40 percent of the countries on the globe after 2001. The Costs of War project at Brown University indicated that these so-called "counter-terrorism" wars have killed over 800,000 people and displaced more than 38 million. The refugee problem that has plagued Europe for years was indeed to a large extent caused by the warlike nature of the U.S.  The U.S. has devolved into a destroyer, and Washington is obsessed with armed forces rather than building peace, according to Stephen Wertheim, Deputy Director of Research and Policy at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.  Repeatedly provoking conflicts and wars, showing indifference to peace talks, and even trying to protract the conflict, the U.S. has fully revealed that to protect global and regional peace and stability is never a priority in its strategy. What matters most to the country is its dominance in the international landscape, especially in the so-called "superpower game."  The above point is well explained by the Ukraine crisis: what makes the U.S.-led NATO contain Russia is the White House's intention to take dominance on the issue of European security.  We live in the 21st century, but the U.S. is still reluctant to abandon the outdated zero-sum games. The warlike U.S. is the largest destroyer of international order, and is in no position to play a guardian of peace.

Profound global changes and the COVID-19 pandemic, both unseen in a century, have plunged the world into a phase of fluidity and transformation. The outbreak of the Ukraine crisis has further complicated the international situation which has already been full of uncertainties.  The evolution of the Ukraine crisis is something all peace-loving countries and people don’t want to see. The deteriorating situation has once again shown that state-to-state relations cannot advance to the stage of confrontation, and conflicts and confrontations are not in the interests of anyone. Peace and security are what the international community should treasure the most.  At such a critical moment, certain Western countries, driven by their own selfish interests, have added fuel to the fire to escalate the Ukraine crisis while criticizing the just position of other countries that urge the settlement of the crisis through dialogue and negotiation. They even claimed that every country should think about what side of history they want to be on over the Ukraine issue. It was like “if you don’t listen to me, then you are on the wrong side of history”.  While exposing the hegemonic mindset of certain Western countries, such remarks and acts of openly asking other countries to take sides are evidence of these countries’ failing to grasp the trend of history and standing on the right side of history.  Countries that stand on the right side of history must support peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Whether they have promoted peace talks or incited confrontation, doused the fire or fanned the flames of war, pursued common interests or selfish gains, history will record justly the merits and demerits of countries’ choices regarding the Ukraine crisis.  China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be fully observed, the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis must be supported.  This is a judgment made independently based on the merits of the matter and the right choice based on a long-term perspective and the intention of safeguarding world peace.  To resolve the Ukraine crisis, all sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace. The U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should also hold dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the crisis.  China’s proposition, while helps avoid escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia, embodies the philosophy “harmony is the most valuable”, which has been valued by the Chinese nation since ancient times, and demonstrates China’s strong sense of responsibility as a major country.  Countries that stand on the right side of history must promote global peace and development.  Peace, development, cooperation, and win-win results are the irresistible trend of the times. Peoples of all countries long for peace and development. China stands for peace and opposes war, which is embedded in the country’s history and culture.  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible major country, China has always faithfully fulfilled its international obligations and played a constructive role in safeguarding world peace and stability.  China has the best record as a major country when it comes to peace and security. It has never invaded other countries, launched proxy wars, sought spheres of influence or engaged in any military bloc confrontation.  To resolve the Ukraine crisis, it is absolutely imperative to promote dialogue and negotiation between Russia and Ukraine, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and cease hostilities as soon as possible.  China has been doing its best for world peace, and will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.  Countries that stand on the right side of history must safeguard equity and justice. The prevailing trends toward a multi-polar world, economic globalization, and the democratization of international relations remain unchanged. Increasingly, international affairs need to be jointly handled by all countries through extensive consultation, while establishing international mechanism, abiding by international rules, and pursuing international justice have become a consensus among the majority of countries.  China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations, adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.  Ukraine’s sovereignty and security should be safeguarded; Russia’s legitimate security concerns should also be respected. Europe’s peace and stability should be defended, so should the peace and stability of other countries.  Major countries in the world should respect each other, reject Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and gradually build balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for their regions and for the world, which is the long-term solution to the Ukraine crisis. China will be pleased to see equal-footed dialogue among the EU, Russia, the U.S. and NATO.  What makes a major country a truly respected one is its responsibility and capability to advance and safeguard global peace.  In this volatile and changing world, China has always upheld and practiced true multilateralism, and stood on the right side of history, the side of peace, cooperation, fairness, and justice, as well as the side of human progress.  Time will prove that China’s proposition represents the right path toward realizing the lasting and peaceful development of the world and creating a more beautiful future for mankind.

(Xinhua/Li Gang)  The Omicron variant of COVID-19 is spreading fast globally. Some U.S. media outlets recently sighed in articles that the pandemic is "still killing 1,200 Americans a day," worrying there might be "another surge." However, in a cynical tone, they said the Chinese mainland the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) are having a "bad year", just to smear China's pandemic response policies and achievements, and even defame China's political system.  Such a narrow and evil view is a total disregard of facts. It turns the pandemic into a tool and weapon out of ulterior political motives.  Facing the pandemic unseen in a century, the Chinese government has always put the Chinese people and their lives in the first and highest place. It has tailored science-based and targeted pandemic control policies according to the spread of the pandemic and the features of the virus, so as to maximumly safeguard people's lives and health, maintain a normal pace of work and life, and ensure the safety of industrial and supply chains.  China is in a leading position globally in economic development and pandemic control, which fully demonstrates the strong ability of the country to control the virus and the obvious advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the socialism with Chinese characteristics.  On the contrary, as the world's largest economy and a country that boasts rich and advanced medical resources, the U.S. has seen rounds of serious COVID-19 resurgence, setting new records in a number of indexes, such as newly confirmed cases, hospitalized cases and children's infections. Nearly a million people have died in the country because of the pandemic.  The unscientific, unequal, and irresponsible pandemic response led by the White House, prejudices held by political parties, as well as the reckless dissemination of fake information have traumatized the credibility of the U.S. government, and the rights to life and health of Americans, whose trust in their government has been "bankrupt."  This clearly shows who's the top scorer and who's the underachiever in terms of pandemic response.  Facing the highly transmissible Omicron variant, the HKSAR experienced a drastic surge in newly confirmed cases and was put in a grave situation.  At the critical moment, the HKSAR government acted responsibly and launched a tough battle to safeguard people's lives and health under the assistance from the Chinese central government.  Expert teams and nucleic acid testing teams were quickly established and dispatched to Hong Kong. A Fire Eye Laboratory, nucleic acid testing vehicles, and quick testing kits were immediately put into use. The first makeshift hospital of Hong Kong was built within a week, and another six with 20,000 beds in less than a month. New waterways were constantly opened for material supply and freight trains were designated to carry assistance materials from the mainland to the HKSAR.  The people in the Chinese mainland, sharing the concerns of their compatriots in Hong Kong, assisted the special administrative region with the fastest speed, highest intensity and widest coverage, to ensure the implementation of the assisting policies of the central government. It has significantly enhanced the Hong Kong citizens’ resolution and confidence in fighting and defeating the virus, and basically contained the rising trend of the pandemic in Hong Kong. The ongoing battle against the pandemic in Hong Kong vividly mirrors the institutional advantages of China.  However, some U.S. media outlets are always making a fuss about the resurgence in Hong Kong, distorting the meaning of "dynamic zero-COVID approach." They said China should relax its pandemic control measures and choose to "coexist with the virus", but this only reflects their evil intentions.  Hong Kong is a city with high population density and high passenger mobility, and it's also bothered by an aging society. "Laid-back" approaches will only make the virus spread faster there and seriously threaten the lives and health of the Hong Kong citizens, thus crushing the hope of restoring normal economic and social operation.  The Guardians recently pointed out that "We all want the disruption and anxiety to stop, but we won’t achieve that with policies that pretend the pandemic is over when it isn’t. It said to stop the pandemic, we must learn to spot and contain worrying outbreaks.  China's pandemic control practices fully prove that the "dynamic zero-COVID approach" is science-based, necessary, effective and feasible. It is something that must be done by a major country with more than 1.4 billion people, as well as an obligation of a responsible government and society. It puts into practice the people-first philosophy and contributes to the world's efforts to fight the pandemic.  According to a recent poll published by Hong Kong-based think tank Bauhinia Institute, over 65 percent of the Hong Kong citizens believe that the "dynamic zero-COVID approach" is in line with the general interests of the Hong Kong society, and more than 80 percent are supportive of the goal raised by the expert team dispatched by the central government to reduce the numbers of deaths, critical cases and infections. The poll also indicated that over 80 percent of the Hong Kong citizens are more confident in defeating the virus because of the central government's assistance.  After directing a documentary recording Wuhan's battle against the pandemic, British director Malcolm Clarke said he and his team have witnessed the invincible state strength of China during the pandemic. He said in China, the whole nation fights as one when it wants to achieve something, which is incredible when measured with Western standards.  Over the past two years and more, China's institutional advantages and powerful state strength have withstood the test of the pandemic, and will keep contributing to the country's fight against the virus. China will build a solid wall of defense against COVID-19 with utmost confidence and achieve a final victory. The U.S. media and politicians that are always defaming China, sowing discord, mongering panic and singing the blues are destined to be disappointed again.

It's not helpful </title><full-text><![CDATA[    The hopeless fault-finder Illustration: Liu Rui/GT  --America's sanctions stick and bellicose rhetoric are only worsening the situation, narrowing the window for a possible clawback from escalation, and steering Ukraine and Russia away from the negotiating table.  --To turn around the deteriorating situation and prevent further needless suffering, the US should use its leverage and work with other nations to bring Ukraine and Russia, among other stakeholders, back to the negotiating table, instead of incessantly throwing dirt on another country.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which erupted precisely a month ago, has been truly frustrating and traumatizing to witness. As tensions swiftly build up and the human toll continues climbing in the region of Eastern Europe, Washington has offered its solutions to the crisis: a joint "sanction" of Russia along with its allies and weapons supplies to Ukraine.  With neither of these approaches seeming to have worked so far, unfortunately, the US has decided instead to shift blame onto other parties, spreading blatant falsehoods and disinformation targeting China, while insinuating that China hasn't done enough to address the crisis.  And yet, such blame games won't do anything to help with the situation either.  American media outlets, almost in tandem with the Ukraine crisis, have kept circulating and spewing anti-China disinformation that is simply fake. Starting earlier this month, the New York Times, joined by other mainstream media outlets, falsely claimed that Chinese officials had "known" beforehand the occurrence of the conflict. Their evidence? An unsubstantiated "Western intelligence report." Their source? Several unnamed officials. Apparently, America's disinformation machine has never once run out of steam with the same fuel.  Less than two weeks later, American media outlets cooked up something richer and even more fantastical. This time, they cited a US intelligence official who suggested that China "has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance," as CNN reported. To even consider giving an official response to such a pure fabrication was not worth the time. Yet, Chinese officials have on multiple occasions shown their utmost patience in debunking the flagrant and sinister lies.  [Related Reading: U.S. can't cover up its responsibility for Ukraine crisis by spreading anti-China disinformation]  Then, this week, the New York Times published a preposterous analytical article headlined "China Takes a Back Seat in International Diplomacy Over Ukraine," in which it suggested that "China has repeatedly called for peace talks in Ukraine," while adding that "What it has not done is press Russia to negotiate…". It is somewhat of a relief to see that the Times used the word "negotiate" instead of "sanction." But their tone seems to suggest that China somehow has a greater ability to sway Russia or press the "stop" button on the conflict than either the US and most of its allies combined might have.  In the American media's warped narratives on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US is whitewashed as a mediator, a peacekeeper, and a savior who protects the vulnerable from utter despair, while China is blackwashed as the nation that "stands aloof," "waits and sees", and hesitates to "act."  But in reality, America's sanctions stick and bellicose rhetoric are only worsening the situation, narrowing the window for a possible clawback from escalation, and steering Ukraine and Russia away from the negotiating table. And its unprovoked smear campaign against China over the Ukraine crisis will do nothing to help bring an end to the conflict, other than divert the public's attention and generate more anti-China hate.  Sanctions provide no path to solutions. Weapons are not the answer to peace. Disinformation is no means of persuasion. To turn around the deteriorating situation and prevent further needless suffering, the US should use its leverage and work with other nations to bring Ukraine and Russia, among other stakeholders, back to the negotiating table, instead of incessantly throwing dirt on another country.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo courtesy of the China International Development Cooperation Agency )  As COVID-19 severely impacts the process of global development, China is leading the international society to focus on and promote development, as well as calling on the world to jointly build a global community of development with a shared future. It exemplifies the wisdom and sense of responsibility of a major country at this critical historical juncture.  As a Chinese saying goes, “A man of wisdom adapts to changes; a man of knowledge acts by circumstances.” The GDI's wide and prompt response stems from the fact that it addresses the common concerns of the international society and the people around the world.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread in the world, and the Human Development Index experienced the first drop in 30 years. As a result of the pandemic, about 100 million additional people are living in poverty and over 800 million suffering hunger.  The world development is getting even more unequal and unbalanced, necessitating urgent action by international society to narrowing the development gap.  As another major initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping after the Belt and Road Initiative, the GDI "remobilizes" the world for global development cooperation and "reconfirms" the people-centered approach to human rights. It has mapped out a strategy for narrowing the North-South gap and addressing development imbalance, and has thereby given a boost to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The GDI has become tremendously attractive because of China's successful practice. Since the country initiated reform and opening up in 1978, it has always taken economic development as a major task and achieved remarkable progress.  The country adheres to a people-centered development philosophy, and is constantly enhancing Chinese people's sense of happiness, fulfillment and security. Pursuing high-quality economic development, it also follows a new development concept featuring innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared growth. The country has eliminated poverty and built a moderately prosperous society in all respects as scheduled, which has further made it a successful example for the rest of the world.  Prioritizing development and centering on the people, the GDI is committed to inclusive and innovation-driven growth, harmonious man-nature coexistence, and results-oriented actions. It carries distinctive Chinese characteristics.    A member of a Chinese agricultural expert team aiding Africa instructs a local technician on agricultural production. (Photo courtesy of the Chinese Embassy in Senegal)  Siddharth Chatterjee, U.N. Resident Coordinator in China, said the initiative explains to the world China's successful experience in building a moderately prosperous society. He believes China will make global development much more inclusive and balanced.  China's broad-minded perspective has made the GDI widely appealing. China always believes that true development is development for all, and all countries should join, contribute to and benefit from global development. It's not right that only one country enjoys development while the rest can't, or a group of countries make progress while other groups don't.  Since the GDI was proposed, it has been a public product that's open to the world. It aims at accelerating the implementation of the U.N.'s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, advancing the common development of the world and making global development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive.  On multiple bilateral and multilateral occasions, President Xi has expressed the hope that all relevant parties can join the GDI, and he has received active responses. At the Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit, he said this initiative is highly compatible with the G20’s goal and priority of promoting global development. He also said that the initiative has much to contribute to ASEAN countries’ efforts to meet their development needs and can be mutually reinforcing with ASEAN Community Vision 2025, while delivering a speech at a special summit to commemorate the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations.  China's practical actions are making the GDI well implemented. What makes an initiative vital is its implementation. Since proposing the GDI, China has been adhering to "results-oriented" actions. It encourages the world to prioritize cooperation in areas such as poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, among other areas.  The Group of Friends of the GDI was launched in January this year and will focus its work on strengthening policy dialogue, sharing best practices and promoting practical cooperation. It is expected to inject important impetus into the implementation of the GDI.  At bilateral and multilateral levels, China is proactively aligning the GDI with development strategies of relevant countries and regions. So far, the initiative has been docked with the Pacific Roadmap for sustainable development and the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent by Pacific island countries. African countries also synergized the GDI with the African Union's Agenda 2063.  Development bears on the hopes and the very survival of the peoples of all countries. It embodies the expression of their dignity and their rights. Facing challenges, the mankind must hold tight the key of development.  China is willing to work with all parties and actively implement the GDI to ensure that no country or individual is left behind and no aspiration is overlooked. It will make new contributions to building a world of common prosperity and building a global community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo/Li Lai)  Lately, Chinese President Xi Jinping held virtual video summits and had video and phone calls with multiple foreign leaders to seek cooperation, promote development and safeguard peace in pursuit of common interests of the international community, showing China’s sense of responsibility as a major country in building a community with a shared future for mankind.  “We need to shoulder our responsibility to bring more stability and certainty to a turbulent and fluid world,” said Xi in a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on March 8.  When speaking with Indonesian President Joko Widodo over the phone on March 16, Xi called on the two sides to keep the global market stable and supply chains unimpeded and promote the concrete implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI).  “China stands ready to work with all parties to uphold true multilateralism, stand for international fairness and justice, and safeguard the legitimate rights and common interests of emerging market economies and developing countries,” he stressed in a phone conversation with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on March 18.  The year 2022 brings with it plenty of challenges. While the COVID-19 pandemic has yet to be conquered, the Ukraine crisis arose, further complicating the international situation that was already filled with uncertainties. Such a critical moment requires countries to pluck up their courage and shoulder their responsibilities.  As a responsible major country, China has always moved on the right course of the historical trend, held high the banner of multilateralism and enhanced cooperation and solidarity with all peace-loving countries that pursue development to jointly address challenges and create a bright future for the entire world.  China is an important force for maintaining world peace. Some major countries, trying to hold on to their hegemony, have resurrected Cold War mentality and stoked bloc confrontation, which has fueled instability and division in the world. China, however, believes that competition between major countries should not be the order of the day and zero-sum game is not the right choice.  It calls on countries to follow the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, reject the notion of exclusive or absolute security, and stay committed to ceasing conflicts through negotiation, resolving disputes through dialogue, and increasing mutual trust through cooperation to jointly build a world of enduring peace.  After the Ukraine crisis emerged, China has endeavored to facilitate dialogue for peace and stressed that all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported, which shows a stark contrast with certain countries that try to add fuel to the fire and fully reflects China’s philosophy of peaceful development.  China has made active efforts to facilitate common development. The country believes that good development is sustainable and true development is development for all.  While focusing on running its own affairs well and promoting high-quality economic development, it has actively developed global partnerships, continuously expanding the convergence of interests with other countries and tightening the ties for common development.  China has pushed ahead with the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road, with the number of countries and international organizations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) reaching 180.  The country has also proposed the GDI and endeavored to promote the building of an international consensus on global sustainable development.  At present, some countries are using the Ukraine crisis as a pretext to implement sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions, dragging down the world economy that is already struggling under the pandemic, which harm various parties including themselves and inflict suffering on the people.  For global stability and the work and life of billions of people, China has been doing its best for world peace and creating favorable conditions for global development.  China supports Indonesia in playing its role as the president of the Group of 20 (G20), and its effort to host a successful 2022 G20 Bali Summit focusing on the theme of “Recover Together, Recover Stronger”, which reflects China’s determination to forge synergy for common development.  China is the mainstay of strengthening global governance. It believes that when faced with challenges of a global nature, no country can stay aloof or unaffected. The country has stressed that all countries must pull together in these trying times, enhance communication and coordination on COVID-19, climate change and other global issues, build maximum consensus, and pursue convergence of interests wherever possible.  China remains steadfast in championing and practicing true multilateralism, advocates the universal values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, and opposes hegemonism, power politics and bloc politics. It calls on all countries to safeguard the UN-centered international system and uphold the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter as they work together to make the global governance system fairer and more equitable.  As the chair of BRICS this year, China is ready to work with various parties to maintain the development momentum of the BRICS cooperation mechanism and build a high-quality partnership that is more comprehensive, closer, more pragmatic and more inclusive, which is expected to further increase the voice of emerging markets and developing countries in global governance.  Facts have proved that in a world of instability and transformation, China always serves as an anchor for stability and a force for good, and always stands on the right side of history.  No matter how the international landscape evolves, China will continue to keep a global perspective, honor its responsibilities, and hold high the banner of peace, development and win-win cooperation to promote the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. It will work with all progressive forces in the world to pursue common development and march toward a shared future. Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo/Xinhua)  The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has garnered widespread attention across the globe. The wall-to-wall coverage and outpouring of reactions to the Russia-Ukraine conflict from the West has raised eyebrows at its double standard toward other humanitarian crises, which has unsheathed flagrant racist and biased attitudes toward the value of non-white lives that also matter.  CBS News senior correspondent in Kyiv Charlie D'Agata, for instance, has faced a widespread backlash due to his discriminatory comments on the Ukraine crisis: "This isn't a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European – I have to choose those words carefully, too – city where you wouldn't expect that, or hope that it's going to happen," he said.  The seasoned correspondent was forced to apologize later, saying he spoke "in a way I regret." However, his remarks are not part of an isolated incident. Ukraine's former deputy general prosecutor David Sakvarelidze spoke to the BBC, suggesting that it is harder for him to watch white people fleeing the conflict.  "It's very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed," Sakvarelidze said. The BBC presenter responded: "I understand and of course respect the emotion."  Likewise, a visibly emotional ITV News correspondent Lucy Watson proclaimed: "Now the unthinkable has happened to them, and this is not a developing, Third World nation; this is Europe," as if victims from the world's other humanitarian crises had naturally been inclined to expect to wake up to a devastating war.  One French commentator on BFM TV, France's most-watched cable news channel, also came under fire, implying that it's much more conceivable to have attacks in other regions of the world. "We are in a European city and we have cruise missile fire as though we were in Iraq or Afghanistan, can you imagine," he said.  Coverage on the Russia-Ukraine conflict has veered into a troubling tone on race and the international status of migrants. Journalists report on the conflict in shock as if bloodshed was the exclusive purview of non-white communities. Such attitudes are strewn across the West and have underlined the Western side's ingrained double standard – namely, valuing white lives over those dying in conflicts outside Europe.  Ukraine's refugee crisis has revealed the West's double standards even more clearly. Whopping numbers of people have fled Ukraine, and they are being welcomed as refugees should be by countries across Europe that previously closed their doors to others.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict has witnessed Western countries' tremendous "solidarity" – providing a steady flow of "support" – in response to the humanitarian crisis. However, Ukraine is not the only country suffering from a humanitarian crisis. Why do these Western countries treat humanitarian crises outside Europe with indifference and unspeakable brutality?  "[Afghan people] must be wondering what makes their humanitarian crisis so unimportant. Is it the color of their skin? Is it that they are not white? They're not European? That their problems come from a U.S. gun or a U.S. invasion," Irish Member of the European Parliament, Clare Daly questioned, denouncing Western countries for treating other humanitarian crises much more lightly compared to the Ukraine crisis.  Trivializing wars in the Middle East and dehumanizing entire populations is not new in the West. The past decades have witnessed Western countries' brazen attitude toward wars in the Middle East that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of people. Missiles from the U.S. landed in the Middle East frequently, but voices from Western media disappeared and reactions were subdued quickly. Casualties in the Middle East seem to be more tolerable to Western media and politicians than those in the present Ukraine crisis, as years of dehumanization have turned the Middle Eastern people into nothing but a statistic confined to the unread columns of newspapers.  CNN political correspondent Julia Ioffe made a horrific comparison between Syria and Ukraine in a clip circulating on social media, which displays the most egregious ramifications of the West's dehumanization of the Middle East. "It's one thing for sarin gas to be used on people far away Syria who are Muslim and who are of a different culture but what is Europe going to do when it's used on European soil on Europeans," she said, suggesting people from the Middle East are inferior to Europeans and that it is somehow acceptable for them to be killed.  The vastly different treatment received by Ukrainians and those of Middle Eastern nationalities on the part of Western countries, in addition to the casual racism displayed in Western coverage of the Ukraine crisis, has laid bare Western biases, prejudices and double standards, which should be of no surprise. In fact, no life is worth more than another. So until Western countries do away with its racist double standard and treat humanitarian crises with equal weight, it simply has "no credibility," just as Daly opined with great gusto in front of the cameras of Western media.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Russia recently exposed military biological cooperation projects conducted by the U.S. in Ukraine, further unmasking the U.S., an empire of military biological activities.  Among all countries in the world, the U.S. has carried out the most military biological activities. The country has inherited the evil legacy of the notorious Unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese Army that waged the war of aggression against China, and developed biological weapons with Fort Detrick as the major base.  Its research and development of biological weapons at the base has continued even after it joined the BWC in 1975. The international community has therefore referred to Fort Detrick as “the center of the U.S. government’s darkest experiments”.  In the past few decades, the U.S. has continuously expanded its scope of military biological activities. According to data released by the country, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) carries out biological cooperation projects in more than 30 countries around the world.  The country controls several hundred biological laboratories using pretexts including cooperation for reducing biosecurity risks and strengthening global public health. Its military biological activities in Ukraine are only the tip of the iceberg.  Despite the international consensus on ensuring compliance with the BWC through multilateral verification, the U.S. has regarded its global military biological activities as its domestic affairs and allowed no external inspection and verification. Therefore, its military biological activities have been running wild.  In 2001, when the international community already reached an agreement on the establishment of a BWC verification mechanism, the U.S. suddenly withdrew from negotiations over the establishment of the mechanism on the pretext that such verification would harm its security and economic interests, and has since been standing alone against the establishment of the mechanism.  It’s exactly because of the lack of verification mechanism that the country’s military biological activities have increasingly aroused grave concerns in the international community.  However, the U.S. has taken a more radical stance on compliance with the BWC when questioned by the international community. The country stubbornly insists that only itself can decide whether it has abided by the convention.  Not only doesn’t it allow the international community to carry out verification, but it rejects questions from any foreign country about its military biological activities and accuses those who raise such questions of spreading disinformation. This is typical bandit logic and hegemonic behavior.  The U.S. often contradicts itself. The self-contradictory information released by the U.S. probably couldn’t even convince itself. Last November, the U.S. said it had cooperation facilities including 26 biolabs in Ukraine. On March 11, the country changed the figure to 46.  The U.S. claimed that it hasn’t controlled labs in Ukraine, but only sent personnel to the country to help ensure lab safety occasionally. However, according to an agreement between the DoD and the Ukrainian side signed in 2005, representatives of the DoD have the right to participate in all related activities at U.S.-Ukraine cooperation facilities, including labs in Ukraine. The agreement also stipulates that all dangerous viruses in Ukraine must be stored in these labs and provided for the U.S. side as required, and information marked or designated by the U.S. side as “sensitive” should be withheld from public disclosure by Ukraine.  The international community can’t help but wonder: Who on earth do these labs belong to? How many of these labs are there? What does the U.S. needs so many viruses for? Why can’t public health information be made public? Given that the U.S. runs biolabs all over Central Asia, East Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Middle East, and Africa, do all these biolabs operate under the so-called “cooperation” model as that in Ukraine?  The international community has no reason not to support the U.S. if it really intends to safeguard biosecurity and strengthen public health. Nevertheless, if the U.S. is using its biological research facilities overseas to grab biological resources and even develop biological weapons, it’s quite another matter.  For the sake of the health and safety of people in Ukraine and its surrounding regions as well as the entire world, it’s time the U.S. gave the international community an explanation for its military biological activities.  It’s hoped that the U.S. will clarify thoroughly its military biological activities around the world with a responsible attitude and stop standing alone in opposing the establishment of the BWC verification regime, so as to help improve global biosecurity.  Compliance with a convention doesn’t equal shouting slogans. All countries must uphold the authority of international law.  The international community has every reason to assess the documents disclosed by Russia under the framework of the United Nations and the BWC, and at the same time listen to the explanation of the U.S. side in a fair and just way. This will help restore the international community’s confidence in America’s fulfillment of its international obligations and improve global biosecurity, which conforms to the common interests of the international community.

Now it's backfired </title><full-text><![CDATA[    Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  --By their very own standard, American media outlets are the culprits caught red-handed, manufacturing lies, conspiracies, disinformation, and even worse, propaganda.   --The US is more of a spreader of such false information than a victim of it.  What has fascinated me the most in American media's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic is their unremitting obsession with the "lab leak" conspiracy.  Through their lens of suspicion and even superstition, the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was no longer a matter of serious science but a fanciful plot, blending with frivolous hearsays, preposterous suppositions, and flagrant prejudices. Despite the fact that numerous scientific studies have proven otherwise, some US media outlets, together with their staunch audiences, are still dwelling upon the lab theories, so much so that they have even begun to cast doubt on America's own bio labs.  On March 9, Fox News host Tucker Carlson brought up the issues surrounding US bio labs on his show, in which he called for clarification on the "dangerous biological weapons in Ukraine." Following US Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland's testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in which she admitted the existence of American 'biological facilities' in Ukraine, Tucker Carlson doubled down on his televised queries again on March 14.  "Why would we (the US) fund something like that in Ukraine…?" the celebrity TV host asked, "If the 'research materials' in these labs were to escape somehow and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world?"  Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, both former American presidential candidates, among other US politicians and military experts, have also seconded Carlson to demand answers to the allegations that the US might have "funded" bio labs and even "bioweapons facility" in Ukraine.  Their questioning over whether the US is funding bio labs in Ukraine has invited harsh criticism. NBC News slammed the notion as a conspiracy theory while accusing Tucker Carlson and other figures on the American far right of promoting disinformation and propaganda. Meanwhile, Senator Mitt Romney arraigned Tulsi Gabbard, who had tweeted that "There are 25 plus US-funded biolabs in Ukraine which if breached would release and spread deadly pathogens to US/world," for spreading "treasonous lies."  The irony here couldn't be more conspicuous. Remember that for the past two years (and counting), American media outlets have kept concocting one "lab leak" conspiracy theory after another with absolutely zero substantiated evidence. By their very own standard, they are the culprits caught red-handed, manufacturing lies, conspiracies, disinformation, and even worse, propaganda. The US is more of a spreader of such false information than a victim of it.  [Related Reading: Tracing the origins of US media's disinformation campaign against China on COVID-19]  But America's bio lab affairs are fundamentally different from the "lab leak" conspiracies with which it has intended to frame up China in vain. The US is the nation that has invested millions of dollars in overseas bio labs, and it is the only nation to have blocked new means for verifying compliance with the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) terms. Its opacity and equivocation pertaining to its global bio lab operations (never mind whether it is developing bioweapons elsewhere or not) require explanation and even call for a joint probe.  While the US has kept rinsing and reusing the same old conspiracy theories, it should have predicted that such inertia in its thinking would enable some US media, to engage in a self-examination of their own nation's record, which can be a benign thing for the sake of global biological safety. Call it a conspiracy spillover. Or call it an "autoimmune" backlash. At last, they have hit the mark by a mere fluke.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

The closing meeting of the fifth session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, March 10, 2022. (People’s Daily/Lei Sheng)  During this year’s “two sessions”, namely the fifth session of the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) and the fifth session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), NPC deputies and CPPCC members actively performed their duties and turned people’s voices and ideas into general consensus on state governance.  The annual meetings have showed the international community how China’s democracy is an extensive and true democracy that works and China’s sound governance has strong democratic foundations.  Democracy starts with the full expression of the people’s wishes. The Chinese government has solicited public opinions and suggestions via multiple channels for drafting the 2022 Government Work Report, and received thousands of opinions and suggestions from all walks of life. More than 1,100 pieces of representative suggestions from netizens were selected, and some key advice has been taken by the report.  Chinese netizens actively participated in the suggestion solicitation campaign called “share your ideas at the ‘two Sessions’”, which enabled different kinds of suggestions from the people to be directly fed to NPC deputies and CPPCC members before and during this year’s “two sessions”.  Through the “two sessions”, the world sees clearly that the Chinese people are showing greater interest in democratic participation, which is expanding in scope and depth and diversifying its forms and channels.    Deputies to the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) walk out of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after the closing meeting of the fifth session of the 13th NPC, March 11, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Guo Junfeng)  Democracy can only be truly implemented through the fulfillment of the people’s wishes. Last year, offices and departments under the State Council handled 8,666 pieces of suggestions submitted by NPC deputies and 5,718 proposals submitted by CPPCC members during the 2021 “two sessions”, which accounted for 96.4 percent and 93.4 percent of the total numbers of motions and proposals, respectively, announced the State Council Information Office (SCIO) right before this year’s “two sessions”.  All the suggestions and proposals submitted by national lawmakers and political advisors during the “two sessions” last year have been handled on schedule, according to the SCIO.  After careful consideration of the suggestions from NPC deputies and CPPCC members, relevant departments adopted more than 4,300 pieces of advice and subsequently introduced over 1,600 policies and measures.  The detailed data has fully proven that China has ensured that its people have channels to express their aspirations, wishes and demands on issues ranging from important national strategies and policies to social governance and basic necessities of life, enabling their voices to be heard and their requests to be answered.  Discussions on the effectiveness of democracy have been mounting in the international community.  People are well aware that in some countries, practice of democracy has increasingly become empty promise—the people are only called upon to vote and then are forgotten once they have cast their votes; the people only hear high-sounding promises during an election campaign but have no say whatsoever afterwards; and they are wooed when their votes are wanted but are ignored once the election is over.  China always holds the belief that democracy is not a decorative ornament, but an instrument for addressing the issues that concern the people. A democracy that only provides people with channels to express their wishes but not ways to fulfill them is not a true democracy.  In China, the people’s status as masters of the country is the essence of people’s democracy. The country’s whole-process people’s democracy ensures that the people’s voices are heard and their wishes are represented in every aspect of China’s political and social life.  China’s democracy is a true democracy that works. It ensures that the people’s demands can be freely expressed and effectively fulfilled and that the Chinese people are both the builders and beneficiaries of democracy.    An official with the Communist Party of China (CPC) committee of Yinxi community, Nanqiao district, Chuzhou city, east China’s Anhui province, asks local residents for advice on community governance, Jan. 3, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Dong Chao)  In recent years, China has achieved major strategic achievements in the fight against COVID-19, historically eliminated absolute poverty, and built a moderately prosperous society in all respects and resolved a series of major risks. The country has embarked on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist country and is marching toward the goal of common prosperity.  These achievements couldn’t have been made without the efforts of the Chinese people empowered by the Chinese democracy.  China’s tremendous achievements in development have proved that its whole-process people’s democracy is reasonable and effective, and has promoted the development and progress of the country and stimulated the creativity of the people, pointed out famous Egyptian jurist Shuki Said.  High-quality democracy in China has improved the system, capacity and efficiency of national governance.  China’s whole-process people’s democracy, created and developed in line with the country’s national conditions, contributes a new model to the international political spectrum. It’s believed that Chinese democracy will surely show stronger vitality and make greater contributions to the progress of human civilization.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

The practice of fabricating rumors to shift the blame has been proven despicable and futile by facts. Such acts can’t cover up America’s responsibility for the Ukraine crisis. Instead, they have further exposed the country’s dangerous intention of stirring up trouble and plunging the world into chaos.    Charity staff members deliver free food on the plaza of the Lviv railway station in Lviv, Ukraine, March 9, 2022. (Xinhua/Ren Ke)  The evolution of the Ukraine issue is something China does not want to see. As a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, China always adopts an objective, fair, and responsible attitude toward global events, makes judgments and takes its stand independently based on the merits of the matter itself.  There is a complex historical background and context behind the Ukraine issue, which needs to be solved with a cool head and a rational mind.  China believes that to resolve the current crisis, countries must uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and respect and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, adhere to the principle of indivisible security and accommodate the legitimate security concerns of the parties involved, settle disputes by peaceful means through dialogue and negotiation, and keep in mind the long-term peace and stability of the region and put in place a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.  China’s stance on the Ukraine issue is open and straightforward, and its suggestions for resolving the Ukraine crisis positive and constructive.  At the moment, the top priority in resolving the Ukraine crisis is to promote peace talks, rather than adding fuel to the flames of tensions between Ukraine and Russia.  China stands, as always, on the side of peace, cooperation, fairness, and justice, supports any endeavor that helps ease the tense situation and bring a political solution to the crisis, and opposes any action that goes against diplomatic settlement of the issue and escalates the tensions.  China has maintained close communication with relevant parties and made efforts to facilitate peace talks. It is ready to continue playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks between Russia and Ukraine and work alongside with the international community to carry out necessary mediation when needed.  China has responded to the Ukraine issue in a responsible way. What it has done to help resolve the crisis has truly demonstrated the sense of responsibility a major country is supposed to have.  In contrast, certain country attempts to create a crisis, benefit from the crisis, and shift its burden of crises onto others, which will only harm both itself and others.  China does not agree to the idea of resolving the Ukraine issue with sanctions and opposes unilateral sanctions that lack the basis of international law.  Sanctions have never been an effective approach to solving problems, but only cause serious difficulty for the economy and people’s livelihood in countries concerned and worsen division and confrontation.  History has long proven that sanctions not only result in an economic situation where multiple players lose, but disrupt the process of political settlement.  According to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department, the number of sanctions imposed by the U.S. has climbed 10 times during the past two decades, and the last U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed 3,800 sanctions during his presidency, which means the administration wielded the big stick of sanctions about three times a day.  The unilateral sanctions imposed by the U.S. have inflicted a lot of trouble on the world and caused persistent and systemic human rights violations. The country should stop abusing sanctions and abandon the futile attempt to coerce other countries into doing things they oppose.  The fact that some politicians and media outlets in the U.S. cooked up and disseminated disinformation over the Ukraine issue has reminded people of America’s disgraceful record of using lies and rumors as pretexts to frequently wage wars.  Throughout its less than 250 years of history, there were only less than 20 years when the U.S. didn’t launch military operations against foreign countries. And among the diverse pretexts for its military interventions abroad, some are even false information fabricated by the U.S. itself.  The U.S. once used a small tube of white powder as evidence of the so-called weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and launched military strikes against the latter, bringing terrible disasters to the Iraqi people.  It also used a video deliberately staged by the White Helmets, an organization funded by Western intelligence agencies, as evidence to conduct air strikes in Syria.  Such lessons are not long gone. The U.S. should reflect on its wrongful actions rather than repeat the same mistakes.  George Frost Kennan, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, warned the U.S. government in the 1990s that expanding NATO up to Russia’s borders would be “the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era”.  As the instigator of the Ukraine crisis, the U.S. should reflect on its role in the crisis and stop deceiving and confusing the public. It’s about time the country shouldered its due responsibility, took practical actions to help alleviate tensions and solve problems and contributed to world peace.

Photo: Xinhua  Hindu extremists are increasingly taking their "militant message" into the mainstream while fermenting "communal hate" in a push to convert India into a Hindu state, wrote the New York Times earlier last month in an in-depth article headlined As Officials Look Away, Hate Speech in India Nears Dangerous Levels.  The article pinpointed the rampant hate speech adopted by Hindu extremists against the Muslim community, including promoting a genocidal campaign to slaughter "2 million Muslims" and even pushing rhetoric in support of ethnic cleansing targeting Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Such hate speech "is stoking communal tensions in a country where small triggers have incited mass-death tragedies," the article wrote.  The prevalence of Islamophobic sentiments and rising incidences of violent attacks targeting Muslims have not garnered enough attention from the Indian government at both the central and local levels. On the contrary, Hindu extremists' heinous agenda is being "enabled" and even "normalized" by political leaders and law enforcement officials in the world's second-most populous nation, the article highlighted.  In consequence, Muslims and even other religious minorities in the country have had to contend with the mounting perils of hate speech and violent attacks.  Emboldened by the re-election of Yogi Adityanath (a monk who in the past formed a youth group accused of inciting violence), who serves as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, Hindu mobs in 2020 staged a series of riots in New Delhi that resulted in the grisly deaths of 53 people (many of whom were burned to death), and over two-thirds of which were Muslims.  In 2021, several video clips of violent attacks by Hindus went viral in India on social media: one showed a 45-year-old rickshaw driver being paraded through the streets of Kanpur, a city in Uttar Pradesh, as his teary daughter begged the mob to stop beating him, as reported by the BBC. In January this year, an Indian pastor and his wife were assaulted and wounded by a mob of Hindu extremists, and when they attempted to file a police report they were rejected by the local police.  India's political figures have not only turned a blind eye to Hindu extremists, but they instead have fostered a symbiotic relationship with them, since the group remains the staunchest supporter of India's right-wing politicians. On March 1, Bloomberg published an analysis entitled Anti-Muslim Hatred Is Shaping India's Elections, which pointed out that Indian political leaders have been exploiting "existing divisions in society" and "deep-rooted religious hatred" to cement their positions. "While India is sensitive to international criticism of its treatment of Muslims, it does little to address the problem," the analysis noted.  In January, Gregory Stanton, director of Genocide Watch, who previously predicted the massacre of the Tutsi in Rwanda before events broke out in 1994, said at a briefing that there were early "signs and processes" of genocide in India, according to Al Jazeera. Stanton was convinced that the Hindu extremists and their genocidal agenda must be stopped. "Because once the mobs take over it could turn deadly," he said.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

A worker produces optical cables in a factory in Suixi Economic Development Zone, Huaibei, east China's Anhui province, March 5, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Li Xin)  The international society generally believes that this target is science-based and reasonable, and mirrors China's initiative. It will help guide public expectations, boost confidence, and build consensus for development, and promote China's high-quality development.  China will keep contributing to global recovery and growth while working to realize the growth target.  Both economic growth rate and increment are important when one evaluates China's contribution to the world economy.  In 2021, China's GDP hit 114.4 trillion yuan, or $17.7 trillion at the yearly average exchange rate. It is estimated to account for over 18 percent of the global economy. The domestic value added of the country reached $3 trillion, which is unprecedented in the history of global economic development.  To increase China’s 2021 GDP of 114.4 trillion yuan by 5.5 percent is equivalent to realizing a 7.4-percent growth five years ago, or a 10.5-percent growth 10 years ago. The 5.5 -percent growth will contribute a considerable amount to the world economic growth.    A woman works at a workshop of a special textile company in Daying Economic Development Zone in southwest China's Sichuan province, March 4, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Liu Changsong)  To evaluate China's contribution to the world economy, one must value both the quantity and quality of the Chinese economy.  At present, global recovery is facing multiple barriers and the process of global development has been severely impacted. To deliver more sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security to the people through development is a common task for all countries.  China is fully, accurately and comprehensively implementing a new development philosophy featuring innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared growth and takes high-quality development as a theme of economic and social development for the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) and beyond.  The country has actively endeavored to transform its growth model, optimized economic structure and shifted growth drivers, creating opportunities for and injecting energy into global development.  An international expert remarked that the adherence of China, a country with 1.4 billion people, to the path of high-quality development is an important contribution made by the country to the world economic development and reflects its major country responsibility.  To evaluate China's contribution to the world economy, one must see the country's development and its interaction with the world.    Citizens visit a tourist attraction in Suining, southwest China's Sichuan province as flowers bloom, March 6, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Liu Changsong)  China is opening up more sectors of the economy in a more thorough fashion to create a world-class business environment established on market principles and the rule of law. From reaching $6 trillion in foreign trade for the first time, to making new records in foreign direct investment inflow, and to signing over 200 cooperation documents on the Belt and Road Initiative with more than 140 countries and 32 international organizations, China is actively integrating itself into the global economy and continuously promoting win-win results through its own development.  Meanwhile, China is a staunch supporter for the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core. It is actively negotiating on and signing more high-standard free trade pacts and regional trade agreements, and building a global governance system that's fairer, more just and more reasonable, playing a significant role in promoting strong, balanced, sustainable and inclusive growth of the world economy.  Obviously, China is facing more risks and challenges in its development, such as the ongoing pandemic, sluggish world recovery, fluctuation in commodity prices, and increasingly more complicated domestic and external environment. However, the country's economic fundamentals sustaining long-term growth remain unchanged.  The country is surely able to withstand downward pressure and maintain stable economic operation, and will inject more positive energy into the world economy to make it stable, healthy and sustainable.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

When the world is still facing the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, deteriorating poverty and inequality, as well as challenges against the global human rights cause, all countries must make joint efforts to better promote and protect human rights,    Two girls play in an agricultural park in Chengjiang township, southwest China's Chongqing municipality, Feb. 12, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Qin Tingfu)  China will continue to steadfastly pursue a human rights development path that meets the trend of times and suits its national conditions. While achieving historic progress in the cause of human rights at home, the country has taken an active part in global human rights governance, making Chinese contributions and providing Chinese schemes.  Respecting and protecting human rights is an unremitting pursuit of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The 100-year history of the CPC is a history of the Party uniting and leading the Chinese people to strive for, respect, safeguard and develop human rights. China's tremendous transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong is a process when the country has continuously ensured the Chinese people's right to life, right to development and other basic human rights.  Having built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, China has brought about a historic resolution to the problem of extreme poverty, providing a solid material foundation for protecting and developing human rights.  When responding to COVID-19, China has put people’s interests first, with a belief that nothing is more precious than people’s lives. It has protected the lives and health of the Chinese people to the maximum extent possible.  China is the only major country in the world that has formulated and implemented action plans on human rights for four consecutive terms. There is increasing awareness in the international community that China is acting as true champions of human rights.  Human rights are historical, concrete and realistic, and cannot be detached from the context of countries' different social and political conditions, history and cultural traditions.  China has made historic achievements in human rights, because it adheres to the leadership of the CPC and the principal status of the people, proceeds from reality, takes the rights to subsistence and development as its primary and basic human rights, protects human rights according to law, and actively participates in global human rights governance. These are major characteristics of China's human rights development, and also valuable experiences gained by the country.    Senior citizens dance at a nursing home in Yichun, east China's Jiangxi province, Feb. 24, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Zhou Liang)  Since June 2017, the resolution proposed by China entitled “The Contribution of Development to the Enjoyment of All Human Rights” has been adopted by the UN Human Rights Council for three times, which fully indicates the wide international recognition received by China for its experiences in human rights development.  Without development, there would be no human rights to speak of, nor could the rights enjoyed by the people be sustainable. The right to development is an inalienable human right, which is affirmed by the UN Declaration on the Right to Development.  On promoting global human rights governance, China acts as an positive contributor to common development. It believes that long-term world development cannot be sustained if some countries get wealthier at the expense of others that are kept poor and backward. Only common development of countries makes a more prosperous world.  China has proposed and implemented the jointly building of the Belt and Road to enhance international development cooperation and share development results with other countries. It also actively pursues South-South Cooperation, offering assistance for other developing countries within its capability with no political strings attached and helping other developing countries, especially the least developed ones, eliminate poverty. Besides, the country has proposed the Global Development Initiative to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is constantly contributing its wisdom and schemes to the development of the international human rights cause.  In judging whether human rights are upheld in a country, one cannot use other countries’ standards, still less apply double standards or use human rights as a political tool to interfere in the affairs of other countries. On promoting global human rights governance, China acts as a firm defender of equity and justice. It steadfastly promotes greater democracy and rule of law in international relations, follows true multilateralism, and steers global human rights governance toward greater fairness, equity and inclusiveness.    Tourists take a bamboo raft on a wetland park in Jinhu county, Huai'an, east China's Jiangsu province, Feb. 26, 2022. (People's Daily Online/He Jinghua)  China is ready to engage in human rights exchanges and cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect, nevertheless, it does not accept self-styled "lecturers" on human rights and rejects stoking bloc confrontation in the name of human rights.  Making voices of justice at the UN Human Rights Council together with other developing countries, China firmly opposes the U.S. and the West interfering in other countries' domestic affairs in the name of the so-called "human rights," which is of significant importance for the healthy development of the international human rights cause.  The realization of human rights is a common pursuit of mankind, and the promotion and protection of human rights a common cause of all countries. China is willing to work with all relevant parties to promote the shared human values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, promote the healthy development of the international human rights cause, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

It ended the prolonged estrangement between China and the U.S. and started the process toward normalization of China-U.S. relations.    Late Chairman Mao Zedong meets with then U.S. President Richard Nixon at Zhongnanhai, the central leadership compound in downtown Beijing, Feb. 21, 1972. (File photo)  As the first joint communiqué between the two countries, the Shanghai Communiqué affirmed the one-China principle. It was followed by the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the U.S. and the August 17 Joint Communiqué, which were issued in 1978 and 1982, respectively.  The one-China principle and the three joint communiqués remain the political foundation for China-U.S. relations. Over the past half century, the relationship between the two countries has made remarkable progress despite ups and downs, and they have both gained huge benefits from their cooperation.  However, in recent years, with an aim to contain China, some people in the U.S. have been trying to deny history and hyping the assertion that the U.S. policy of engagement with China has failed. Such practice mirrors Cold War mentality. It negates the history of China-U.S. relations, the achievements made by the two countries in the past 50 years, and the efforts made by the two peoples to promote China-U.S. relations.    Late Chairman Mao Zedong meets with then U.S. President Richard Nixon at Zhongnanhai, the central leadership compound in downtown Beijing, Feb. 21, 1972. (File photo)  The recovery and development of China-U.S. relations was one of the most important event in the development of international relations during the past 50 years, which has benefited the both the two countries and the rest of the world. What's the most important for the development of international relations over the next 50 years to come is that China and the U.S. must find a right way to get along with each other.  The commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the issuance of the Shanghai Communiqué offers an occasion for the two countries to draw experience and wisdom from history, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track as soon as possible.  To continue upholding the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué, the two countries must advance with history and keep their relations on the right track.  Fifty years ago, the "historic handshake across the vastest ocean" astonished the world. However, China-U.S. relations have encountered adversity today. It is because some people in the U.S. are not willing to admit China's rapid development and take China as their major strategic competitor and even an imaginary enemy out of their biased understanding. Such perspective reflects their misjudgment in China's development philosophy, as well as their ignorance for the development of history.  To bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track, the U.S. must act with political wisdom and courage, understand China and China's development correctly, and abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum games targeting at China.  To continue upholding the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué, the two countries must properly manage their differences according to the principle of seeking common ground while putting aside differences.  In the Shanghai Communiqué, China and the U.S. admit that they have essential differences in social system, but it has not affected the development of their relations. The spirit of seeking common ground while putting aside differences reflected in the Shanghai Communiqué is especially of practical significance in today's situation.  Some people in the U.S. have intentionally underlined the ideological differences between China and the U.S. to provoke confrontation. Such practice ignored the fact that the common interests shared by the two countries are way bigger than their differences. It is against the aspiration of the two peoples and the common interests of the world.  It's not a big deal that China and the U.S. have differences and issues. What's important is that they must manage these differences and issues through sincere communication, so as to prevent strategic misjudgment and avoid confrontation.

To continue upholding the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué, the two countries must deal with the Taiwan question according to the one-China principle.  The one-China principle, affirmed in the Shanghai Communiqué, was further confirmed and developed in the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations and the August 17 Joint Communiqué.  At present, to contain China with the Taiwan question, the U.S. side has been trying to distort and hollow out the one-China principle, which has brought serious danger to both the stability in the Taiwan Strait and China-U.S. relations.  The reunification of China is an unstoppable trend. It will never be changed by any individual, any force or any country. The U.S. must fully recognize that the Taiwan question is highly sensitive, abide by the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués, and stop any practice that challenges the one-China principle or undermines the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. It must also resolutely and firmly oppose "Taiwan Independence," and stop sending wrong signals to “Taiwan independence” forces.

In 2021, the U.S. public persona of “human rights defender” was totally debunked, and the country has become the “biggest destroyer” of human rights in the world, the report said.  According to the report, in the U.S., political manipulation led to a sharp surge in COVID-19 deaths; shooting deaths hit a new record; fake democracy trampled on people’s political rights; violent law enforcement made life harder for migrants and refugees; discrimination against ethnic minority groups, especially Asians, intensified. In the meantime, unilateral U.S. actions created new humanitarian crises across the globe.  Despite having world’s most advanced medical equipment and technology, the U.S. has the biggest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths globally. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.S., the epidemic prevention and control has been highly politicized, which has become a tool and a bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to attack, reject and confront each other.  The U.S. government’s unscientific, unequal and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control conducts have seriously undermined its people’s rights to life and health. People’s mental health deteriorated due to the uncontrolled outbreak. The number of the homeless is staggering. The elderly’ rights to life are flagrantly violated.  According to statistics, the average life expectancy of U.S. citizens fell by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War. In particular, the decline in life expectancy among African Americans and Latinos was much more than that among whites. Rather than promoting international cooperation on vaccines, the U.S. has repeatedly coerced the WHO and been keen on shifting the blame and political manipulation.  As developing countries are in dire need of vaccines, Washington vigorously pursues “America First” and is engaged in “vaccine nationalism," interfering and dragging down global anti-pandemic cooperation. What the U.S. has done is disregard for the rights to life and health that should be enjoyed by all the people in the world, including Americans.  The U.S. has long been habitually touting itself as the "beacon of democracy." However, as a matter of fact, American people's political rights are trampled on by politicians who manipulate fake democracy. Money politics become increasingly rampant in the U.S., which makes politicians more neglectful of people’s interests and demands. Democrats and Republicans are doing everything to restrain and harm electors’ right to vote. The election chaos in the country has further intensified political polarization and continues to tear the society apart.  Investigations indicated that the public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since 1958, and international confidence in the U.S. democratic system continues to decline.  Though American democracy is rotting, the U.S. is still reluctant to face up to the reality. It is trying to politicize democracy and takes it as a tool to force other countries to pick sides and form cliques to divide the world. Under the disguise of protecting "democracy" and "human rights," the U.S. initiated the so-called Summit for Democracy. However, it only ended up as a farce that drew wide criticism from the international society.  The U.S. has always pursued hegemonism, unilateralism and interventionism to maintain its global hegemony. The country frequently uses force, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Its abusive use of unilateral sanctions has caused humanitarian crises.  According to the New York Times, investigation found that more than 50,000 U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were reckless and poorly targeted, killing tens of thousands of civilians. A study by an American university indicated that the 20-year U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. A total of 3.5 million Afghans have been displaced.  The belligerent U.S. is challenging justice with hegemony, trampling on righteousness with self-interest, and wantonly violating human rights in other countries. It has become the biggest obstacle and destroyer of the sound development of the international human rights cause.  The U.S. should face up to and solve its own human rights problems and stop politicizing human rights. It should also join other countries in obeying the principles and rules of the UN Charter and carrying out constructive dialogues and cooperation in the sphere of human rights, so as to jointly promote the healthy development of the international human rights cause.

Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is at a critical moment when unfair distribution of vaccines is severely hindering the global fight against the virus.    On Jan. 26, 2022, 300,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines donated by China to Mali arrive in Bamako, capital of the African country. (Photo courtesy of the Chinese Embassy in Mali)  Just as UN General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid said, "Our strength lies in solidarity," mankind must unite together and strive to reach the goal of global vaccination as early as possible, so as to put the pandemic to an end soon.  Enhancing unity to fight COVID-19 is the first of the three major issues that deserve much thought and attention at present and over the coming period globally, told by Chinese President Xi Jinping to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres when the two met recently.  To achieve fair distribution of vaccines and fill the immunization gap is an urgent task. So far, over 10 billion doses of vaccines have been administered globally. However, only around 17 percent of the people in Africa have received at least one shot, and vaccination rate is lower than 10 percent in 27 countries.  As a provider of global public products, China is striving to build a global community of health for all. It has made important contribution to the global fight against the virus and won international acclaim.    Hungary received the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by China's Sinopharm on Feb. 16 and started administering them eight days later, becoming the first country in the EU to use Chinese vaccines. (Photo from sinopharm.com)  China actively advocates and practices solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As a staunch supporter of global solidarity against the virus, China is the first country to make and practice the commitment to taking COVID-19 vaccines as a global public product.  Last year, Xi proposed the Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative, aiming to enhance vaccine equity and accessibility in developing countries, so that the immune barrier would be built at an early date.  He stressed at the 2022 World Economic Forum Virtual Session that of particular importance is to fully leverage vaccines as a powerful weapon, ensure their equitable distribution, quicken vaccination and close the global immunization gap, so as to truly safeguard people's lives, health and livelihoods. Guterres expressed his thanks to China for the country's contribution to improving vaccine accessibility in developing countries.  China is the largest contributor to fair distribution of vaccines. As a country that delivers on its promises, China fully supports the UN target of administering vaccines to over 70 percent of the global population by mid-2022.  So far, China has provided over 2.1 billion doses of vaccines for more than 120 countries and international organizations, becoming the biggest provider of outbound vaccines among all countries. Half of the vaccine doses administered around the world were made in China. Most of the vaccines received by many countries, especially developing countries, came from China.  The vaccines provided by China have enhanced the capability, confidence and resolution of developing countries in the fight against the pandemic. Chief Executive of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization Seth Berkley called China's efforts an important contribution to the global fight against the virus.    A new batch of anti-pandemic materials donated by the Chinese government to the Solomon Islands arrive in Honiara, capital of the Solomon Islands, Feb. 18, 2022.&nbsp;(Photo courtesy of the Chinese Embassy in Solomon Islands)  China is a devoted practitioner of joint vaccine production. It is among the earliest to support the waiver of COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property rights and to transfer technologies to developing countries. It has launched joint vaccine production with 20 countries, with an annual production capacity of one billion doses.  On Feb. 20, China and Egypt jointly donated 500,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Palestine. It marked the first time for Egypt to send its locally produced COVID-19 vaccines abroad. Egypt's acting Health Minister Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar introduced that Egypt has so far produced more than 30 million doses of the vaccine, and their safety and efficiency are guaranteed. Through concrete actions, China has enhanced the vaccine production capacity of developing countries, setting a exemplary model of solidarity in the fight against the pandemic.  China is an active participant in multilateral cooperation on vaccines. It supports the World Health Organization in playing a central and coordinating role, and gives priority to the procurement needs of the COVAX Facility, to which China has supplied over 200 million doses of vaccines. China has also donated $100 million to the facility for the distribution of vaccines in developing countries.  At the UNGA High-level Meeting on COVID-19 Vaccines, China proposed to build a "safety net" for immunity, build up anti-pandemic "arsenals," improve the "governance shield" for health and strengthen the "anchor of stability" for development, which demonstrated the country's firm support for multilateral cooperation.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

Local farmers pick vegetables at a planting base established by Guangping county, Handan city, north China’s Hebei province, for the purpose of helping farmers increase income, Feb. 24, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Cheng Xuehu)  In April 2018, 20 farmers, who are also members of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in Huangdu village, Anji county, east China’s Zhejiang province, wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, saying that they would like to donate 15 million tea seedlings to people in poverty-stricken areas so as to help them become well-off in the way people in Huangdu village did.  During the past few years, Huangdu village has not only donated tea seedlings to some once-impoverished regions, but sent technical instructors to help people who received the seedlings select and grow them as well as pick and dry tea leaves. As it turns out, these tea seedlings have not only helped the counties that received the tea seedlings become better-off, but sown the seeds of hope for a prosperous life in more areas.  The story is a vivid demonstration of how people who become well-off first help the latecomers achieve prosperity.  Achieving common prosperity for all Chinese people is an abiding commitment of the CPC.  However, it should be noted that in China, a country with a vast territory and a large population, regions are different from one another in terms of natural resource endowment and foundation of development, which means that the goal of common prosperity is neither to bring prosperity to everyone simultaneously, nor to see that regions reach a certain level of affluence all at the same time.    Embroiderers make embroideries with the techniques of Qiang ethnic group at a training base in Ningqiang county, Hanzhong city, northwest China’s Shaanxi province, Feb. 26, 2022. The county built the training base to help females increase their income and protect traditional culture of Qiang ethnic group. (People’s Daily Online/Wu Tianwen)  Different groups of people vary not only in terms of the level of prosperity they can potentially achieve, but also the length of time they need to achieve it. Furthermore, it would be impossible to develop all regions at the same pace because of the gaps in wealth that still exist between them.  Therefore, the realization of common prosperity is a dynamic process of pushing ahead. Instead of bringing prosperity to everyone simultaneously, ensuring all regions reach the same level of affluence at the same time, and building an egalitarian or a welfare state, China’s goal of common prosperity requires a process of gradually achieving prosperity for all along a path featuring changes from the parts to the whole and from quantitative changes to qualitative transformation.  In terms of the specific method, the country allows some people and regions to become prosperous first, and encourage them to provide assistance for those latecomers.  Encouraging some people to embrace prosperity first, the country has invigorated its social and economic development, mobilized the enthusiasm of entrepreneurs, and facilitated the healthy development of various types of capital. Meanwhile, it has strived to help the latecomers to become well-off by promoting social equity, properly adjusting excessive income, and encouraging high-income groups and enterprises to give back to society, in a bid to gradually achieve common prosperity.    Tea farmers cultivate tea seedlings in Chun’an county, Hangzhou city, east China’s Zhejiang province, Feb. 26, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Wang Jianlin)  Just as a happy life is achieved through hard work, common prosperity can only be created with ingenuity and effort. It is not something that will arrive naturally, but will only be realized through the joint efforts of all Chinese people.  The country believes that only by encouraging people to increase income and become rich through hard work, honest labor, lawful operations, creating conditions that are more inclusive and fair for people to get better education and improve their development capabilities, and shaping a development environment that provides chances for more people to become wealthy, can it enable every person to enjoy self-development and serve society, and ensure equal opportunities for all to live a rewarding life and realize their dreams.  On top of that, China plans to establish basic institutional arrangements enabling coordination and complementarity between the primary, secondary, and tertiary distribution and intensify efforts to regulate distribution through taxation, social insurance, and transfer payments while also working to make these efforts more precise, so as to make development more balanced, coordinated, and inclusive and the gains of development benefit all people in a more substantial and equitable way.  Various kinds of market entities are the main participants in economic activities, the main providers of employment opportunities and the main promoters of technological progress, playing a very important role in national economic development.  Enterprises, among all kinds of market entities, have not only economic and legal responsibilities, but social and moral ones.  Only entrepreneurs who sincerely repay society and earnestly fulfill their social responsibilities can win social recognition and meet the needs of the times.    Photo taken on July 15, 2021, shows a picturesque view of tea gardens and villages in Anji county, Huzhou city, east China’s Zhejiang province. (People’s Daily Online/Pan Xuekang)  On the one hand, enterprises should carry out honest and lawful operations and create wealth for society, which is not only their primary duty, but a proper way to contribute to the goal of common prosperity.  On the other hand, China encourages enterprises and social groups that have the intention and capability of participating in public-interest and charitable activities to actively take part in such activities and play a role in tertiary distribution. At the same time, the country fully respects enterprises’ free will to or not to make charitable donations, and will never pursue common prosperity by “killing the rich to help the poor”.  The sure way for China to achieve common prosperity is to encourage some people and regions to become rich first through honest labor and lawful operations, and then help the rest of the Chinese people and regions embrace prosperity too, which also conforms to the laws underlying the development of human society.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Liu Jie)  As if the supply of anti-China disinformation has exceeded the demand in the US, the American government decided to blow federal money to export it. On February 4, the US House of Representatives greenlighted the America COMPETES Act, in which a sum of 500 million dollars was allotted to "produce journalism for overseas audiences that is critical of China," according to American Prospect, a US-based magazine.  [Read More: A 500-million-dollar business! America's state-sponsored anti-China propaganda]  The move appears to be dangerous and desperate but not at all unforeseeable. It just marks a crescendo of the US' unrelenting and undisguised smear campaign against China. For years, the US has concocted piles of erroneous reports and made numerous groundless accusations. Negative coverage of China, at the tip of its disinformation iceberg, is merely news—it's a 24/7, all-season regular program that takes bias and negativity as its unchanging formula.  To better understand the nature of America's slanted portraits of China, let's dig deep into the different tones and rhetoric recently adopted by US politicians and media outlets when it comes to similar issues.    A police car blocking the road is seen in Ottawa, Canada, Feb. 10, 2022. (Xinhua/Lin Wei)  Take the "Freedom Convoy" protest in Canada first. As a convoy of angry truckers crammed onto the roadway to blockade a key US-Canada border bridge and occupied the city center of Ottawa, this was what media from its neighboring country had to say: "By illegally occupying streets in downtown Ottawa, it has upended daily life in a city of 1 million people," a Washington Post editorial wrote. CNN cited a portfolio of polls and pinpointed that "a strong majority of Canadians oppose convoy protests."  But bear in mind that roughly three years ago, when rioters jammed onto the main streets of China's Hong Kong, a city that is home to over 7 million people, vandalizing public facilities and wreaking havoc on the entire society, the same American media outlets joined forces to justify the barbaric riots as "peaceful protests," in total disregard of the daily life of Hong Kong residents (or did they really care?).    Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  Another moment of American-style hypocrisy manifested itself when Amnesty International published an "apartheid" report on February 1. A report that is written by several "experts" and published by a "famed" international organization— should such a publication contain anything critical of China, the US media will go full steam ahead to manufacture thousands of pages of "convictions". But this time around the subject matter in that report is focused on Israel—one of America's closest allies. This article will not discuss the authoritativeness of that report. But just let's have a look at how the US side has since reacted. Following the release of the report, dozens of US legislators slammed it as "biased," "baseless" or "racist." The Wall Street Journal penned a lengthy editorial to denounce the report as "slander" and a distortion of history, while the New York Times, which has been vocal on the issue and adept at citing such reports, didn't publish a single word on the report. However, such indignation and "self-censorship" only happen when US allies are involved.  After Adrian Zenz fabricated his fraudulent and groundless "Xinjiang report," US politicians and media outlets thronged together onto a self-stylized moral high ground. To blackwash a place that they only "surveyed" in the false report and pretend to care about a group of people they speak of only when it permits attacking China, they won't hesitate a second to deploy their hatred-rooted, bias-driven diction and labels.  [Special Coverage: Rediscovering Xinjiang]  Bias and bigotry have reached their peak in American media's slanted coverage of COVID-19. From the efficacy of China's COVID-19 vaccines to the effectiveness of China's epidemic control methods—never minding the lab leak conspiracy these people fabricated to frame up China in vain—they appear to have willfully set aside what little ethics they have and all of their objectivity when covering any issues pertaining to China.  Every time China has achieved a milestone in its vaccination drive or donated a batch of its vaccines, the America-first media squad never once forgot to mention that Made-in-China vaccines are "inferior" or that China's vaccine donations were tantamount to nothing more than "vaccine diplomacy." But when COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates kept climbing on American soil even among previously vaccinated people, they blamed it on breakthrough cases. Through their gloomy lens, China's zero-COVID-19 strategy seems like a mess; and a dozen cases in China appear to be "destructive." Even when China kept infections at bay while holding the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games during a global PANDEMIC, the US media peddlers somehow managed to lend their criticism: the Games, they said, were "joyless."    Endless slander/Illustration: Chen Xia/GT  While the US adopted a negative stance on China's use of an Olympics "bubble" (a.k.a. its closed-loop epidemic management system), isn't the US creating and living in its own anti-China disinformation "bubble" where objectivity is absent, and where biases and Sinophobia flourish.  Some US politicians and media might be willing to dwell indefinitely within this kind of negative environment filled with anti-China propaganda, and by allocating half a billion dollars in the course they are officially making it a business. One Reddit user commented satirically as quoted in the American Prospect article, openly expressing opposition to the US government's policies: "Propaganda to get the people to support war and the war machine! [A] Perfect way to spend our tax dollars!"  But living in a toxic political space always has consequences. In a society brimming with disinformation and misinformation, how can the public find its moral compass in a time of crisis? When American media and US politicians spend more time, energy, and resources on slamming another country's COVID-19 vaccines and epidemic control methods while frequently boosting conspiracy theories, they have also fostered the "Frankenstein" side of the American crowd to attack the COVID-19 vaccines and restrictions deployed by their own country.  Also, when the US is staging a relentless smear campaign against China, the entire Asian community has borne the brunt of the targeted hatred in American society. A recent report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism has found that anti-Asian hate crimes surged 339% in 2021, adding to the 150% hike that already occurred in 2020. By funding a campaign of badmouthing China and the country's people, the US will not only blur the line between objective news coverage and pro-American propaganda but will also obscure the limits between reality and falsehood, which risks reinforcing racism and bigotry that are already deep-rooted in the US.&nbsp;    People denouncing hatred against the Asian American communities rally before San Gabriel Mission Playhouse in City of San Gabriel, Los Angeles County, California, the United States, March 20, 2021.

America's state-sponsored anti-China propaganda </title><full-text><![CDATA[    Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  500 million dollars. That's the sum of money the US congress planned to allocate to churn out negative news coverage on China. First reported by American Prospect on Feb. 9, the bill was stuffed into the China-centered America COMPETES Act that just got passed by the US House of Representatives earlier this month. A majority of the half-billion-dollar fund will go to the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), a state-run media service that oversees Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe (RFE), and Radio Free Asia (RFA), which have a record of "blurring the line between objective news coverage and pro-American propaganda," the article wrote.  The malicious plan constitutes a flagrant departure from the principles of "media independence" and "media objectivity" that are self-proclaimed by many in the US. It is tantamount to state-sponsored propaganda, which the superpower has borrowed—along with other dishonorable tactics, e.g., setting up a spy mission center targeting China—from previous approaches adopted during the Cold War era.  [Related Reading: CIA's new China mission center takes a page from America's cold war playbook]  As early as 1946, a bulk of 19 million dollars was appropriated by the US Congress to offset the Soviet Union's "misrepresentation of the United States." Two years later, Congress passed the Smith–Mundt Act and earmarked 30 million dollars to "promote a better understanding of the United States in other countries." In 1953, a specific propaganda institution—the United States Information Agency (USIA)—was established to counter Soviet Union influence while seeding American values, which Dwight Eisenhower, then American president, described as "aspirations for freedom, progress, and peace."  Meanwhile, RFE and VOA, the driving forces of America's propaganda machine, continued to extend their antennas behind the Iron Curtain. While both RFE and VOA purported to tell the "truth" to the world in an objective manner, they in practice "created an aura of American infallibility in which all of its opponents [were] portrayed as evil and grasping," as wrote Ralph A. Uttaro in his essay The Voices of America in International Radio Propaganda. Throughout their operation during the Cold War, RFE and VOA had repeatedly crossed the line between information and incitement (for example, RFE's broadcasts ahead of the Hungarian revolution in 1956 was viewed by many as encouraging citizens to revolt) and allowed the US government to heavily manipulate and fund their broadcasts, especially during the McCarthy era.  The arrival of the 500-million-dollar bill to direct disinformation against China suggests that the US is preparing to reopen its Cold War toolbox to wage yet another propaganda campaign. Under the disguise of the "free press" and "objective reporting," the US is now eyeing a chance to sponsor its media squads to re-enact their role as an instigator rather than as a reporter. The concepts of journalistic credibility and independent reporting inlaid in the motto of American outlets like VOA couldn't be more ill-founded and satirical with the passage of such a propaganda bill. Anyone in the US who advocates for objectivity and neutrality in journalism should feel embarrassed.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

It is an important issue how to overcome global challenges, find the right path to peaceful development and prevent collective helplessness from turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy, which tests the wisdom of various parties.

(Photo/Courtesy of Chinese Embassy in Tanzania)  The themes of the MSC have largely mirrored the real social mentalities of Western countries. From the theme of “Westlessness” of the 56th MSC held in 2020 to this year’s theme of “Unlearning Helplessness”, the conference has paid continuous attention to uncertainties.  As the Munich Security Report 2022 pointed out, many people in Western countries sensed that they are losing control over global events, and seem to conclude that it will not be possible to solve humanity’s most challenging problems.  The sense of helplessness has root causes that shouldn’t be ignored. In fact, it is a widespread feeling in Western countries that emerged from the lack of solutions to global challenges, a result of their failure to make timely adjustments to respond to major changes unseen in a century.  If countries squander the most powerful instruments for maintaining a rules-based international order and for fighting global security threats, namely institutions like the United Nations Security Council, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the World Health Organization (WHO), then their helplessness is truly self-inflicted, according to Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the MSC.  To get rid of the sense of helplessness, countries should first embrace the right concept of security. As the interests of countries in the world are more and more closely intertwined, security issues are increasingly interconnected, transnational, and diverse. The scenario described in the Kazakh proverb that goes “Someone who tries to blow out another’s oil lamp will set his beard on fire” is the reality of the times.  The COVID-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc across the world. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world has totaled over 400 million, while that of people killed by the disease has reached nearly six million.  In order to win the final victory over the pandemic, various countries must adhere to the approach of solidarity and cooperation.  Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions have made it more imperative to uphold dialogue and consultation and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility.  Countries around the world must champion the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and abandon the wrong idea of exclusive security and absolute security.  As the WHO pointed out, countries in the world need to cooperate with each other to tackle the common challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Public statements should aim to reduce tensions, not inflame them,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the recent MSC.  The long-term solution to the sense of helplessness is to safeguard multilateralism and international order.  For some time, certain major country has revived the Cold War mentality and stoked confrontation between blocs, willfully imposed unilateral sanctions upon other countries and sabotaged international rule of law, formed various small circles and stirred up conflict and confrontation, been obsessed with “decoupling” and creating barriers and bucked the trend of globalization, and played up the position of strength and pursued hegemony and bullying.  Such acts run counter to the general trend of multipolarity and greater democracy in international relations.  State-to-state relations cannot be simply defined by competition. Countries in the world should never attempt to wind back the clock of history and repeat the past mistakes of building alliances and pursuing confrontation.  They must make the right choice and work together to build a new type of international relations that feature mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation; they must be committed to promoting solidarity and cooperation, jointly advocate and practice true multilateralism, safeguard the authority of the UN, and abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. No country should replace international rules with its own will or place itself above international rules.  This year’s MSC continued to include a special conversation with China, which focused on how to view China and China’s development.  In the face of the protracted COVID-19 pandemic, China, steadfast in making COVID-19 vaccines a global public good, has provided more than 2.1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines for over 120 countries and international organizations.  Against the backdrop of the turbulent international situation, China has followed the new thinking of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and persisted in solving various regional hotspot issues through political means, playing a constructive role in safeguarding international peace and security.  Facts have shown that China, on its journey of higher-quality development and with stronger capacity to put plans into practice and fulfill promises, will certainly inject more impetus into the post-pandemic recovery of the world and make greater contribution to international peace and stability.  As the world is going through intertwined waves of major changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, various countries are all in a giant ship on which their shared destiny hinges, instead of riding separately in small boats.  Only when countries row the oars together and cheer up each other, rather than undercut and come after one another, can they overcome the current challenges and sail into a bright future.

Improving its people's livelihood is </title><full-text><![CDATA[    Illustration: SHI YU/CHINA DAILY  The epic war (431 to 405 BCE) between Athens and Sparta, chronicled by Athenian historian Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War, was as inevitable as it was atrocious. The two sides were at daggers drawn for decades prior to the battle, and most importantly—as Thucydides, who himself served as a general during the war, indicated—they constituted the curse of inescapable clashes: a ruling power and a rising power. Scholars and experts have since resorted to Thucydides' account to decipher historical conflicts (e.g., the two world wars) and predict future ones. Among them is American political scientist Graham Allison, who invented the famous Thucydides Trap to describe a prospective conflict between the world's two biggest economies—the US and China.  A decade has passed since Mr. Allision coined the term, and yet the two nations have shown little tendency towards falling victim to the trap. True, the China-US relations have encountered occasional obstacles over the course of the past decade, but most of these are predictable and manageable; and leaders from both sides have on multiple occasions cautioned against any kind of conflict. Even at a time when the US is throwing its trade and diplomacy tantrums, China has exercised considerable restraint and made its utmost efforts to steer the bilateral relations away from unrepairable rupture.  That, however, doesn't stop some US politicians and media outlets from incessantly rehashing the misconception that the China threat is looming on the horizon and that unless the US acts forcefully to squash it, the superpower is going to lose big.  Is this really the case?  If we pay heed to America's record of demonizing and bullying the no.2 nation in the name of curbing external threats (to American jobs, national security, or the so-called "American values") we will find that most of its "threat narratives" have been established on the same perpetual fear that an ascendant runner-up nation will outcompete the superpower and eventually imperil its supremacy. It was with that unprovoked paranoia, combined with its zero-sum mindset, that the US had wielded its big stick to stifle competition from Germany, Japan, and the EU in the past. Trade tariffs, exclusion bills, sanctions, delisting, xenophobic propaganda, etc.—these aren't new inventions designed to target China, but old practices borrowed from its past triumphs.  However, by forging a resemblance between China and America's previous "challengers" and crying wolf over it, the US has fundamentally mistaken the reality of the situation and miscalculated China's intention.  China is by no means on par with the US economically and therefore shouldn't be falsely portrayed as the latter's rival. American pundits are fixated on citing the GDP, trade volumes, and foreign exchange reserves as evidence of the mounting "China threat," but what they refuse to acknowledge is the fact that all the aforementioned metrics, once divided by 1.4 billion, will send China to the middle-income country category. As Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng correctly pointed out at the Macro Situation Annual Forum held in Beijing on January 18 that, some one billion Chinese have never flown in an airplane, over 200 million Chinese families don't have a flush toilet, and only less than 4% of Chinese people have a college degree (by contrast, around one in four Americans have one). China, after all, still is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, a developing country.    Poverty relief assistants Liu Ying (1st L) and He Changle (2nd L), as well as village officers, help carry melons planted by villagers in Dongqin Village, Congjiang County of southwest China's Guizhou Province, Nov. 11, 2020. (Xinhua/Yang Wenbin)  Another reason why China is on no trajectory to dethrone the US from its position of global supremacy is that China has never harbored such an intention. Having just lifted all its people out of poverty and built itself into a moderately prosperous society, China remains preoccupied with its own agenda—that is, meeting people's aspirations for a better life—rather than involving itself in unrealistic and costly contentions for power. On the other hand, as a staunch supporter of multilateralism, China has long been committed to building a community of a shared future for mankind, instead of embracing isolationism and hegemony for geopolitical gains. In practice, China's policymaking revolves around its people, not a single political party; and its global presence is focused on delivering benefits for the whole world, rather than a particular alliance of nations. China and the US are like two poles apart celestial bodies—one is revolving on its own axis and along the common orbit, while the other is engrossed with creating its own system and order. How could the two possibly collide?  It is wise to draw lessons from history. But blindly drawing parallels between the past and the present and acting accordingly is imprudent and dangerous. China-US relations have nothing in common with previous declining-and-rising-powers relations. China, in its long history, has never been a hegemon. It has never initiated wars or invaded foreign lands. It seeks no regional clout or geopolitical sway. It cares more about the interests of its own people and the universally recognized norms and values than outcompeting any other nation. Therefore, it is beyond all reason for the US to designate China as the major player of its competition game when China, which has been engrossed with its own mission, is averse to join.  On Feb. 4, the US government passed the so-called "China Competition Bill," a multibillion-dollar package designed to cement its "economic competitiveness." The passage of the bill came as no surprise since the only bills that can be greenlighted in US Congress nowadays are all about China. As the Wall Street Journal pungently pointed out, it is a "Be More Like China Act," a duplicate of China's "industrial policy." The bill, together with other China-focused bills proposed by the Biden Administration, gets only one thing right: touching upon domestic affairs and people's welfares. Those bills, whatever their hidden agenda, at least remind the US government that there are still roads to be rebuilt, bridges to be fixed, inflation to be curbed, and climate puzzles to be solved. But the US should understand that the China threat rhetoric isn't the cure for any of these problems, and obsessing with power contention narratives won't help the US to avert Thucydides Trap (or any traps), it will only get the US struck in the Thucydides Trap trap: its persistent zero-sum mindset.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Photo taken on May 28, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building behind traffic lights in Washington, D.C., the United States.

Chinese President Xi Jinping attends the World Economic Forum (WEF) Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda and delivers a special address via video link in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 25, 2021. (Xinhua/Li Xueren)  He elaborated upon the right direction in which the international community can work jointly to defeat the pandemic, the ultimate solution to promoting steady recovery of the world economy, practical approach to bridging the development divide and suggestions for countries to get along with each other.  His remarks showed China’s firm determination to work together with the rest of the world to survive the trying times and jointly create a better post-COVID world.  “As a Chinese saying goes, ‘The momentum of the world either flourishes or declines; the state of the world either progresses or regresses.’ The world is always developing through the movement of contradictions; without contradiction, nothing would exist. The history of humanity is a history of achieving growth by meeting various tests and of developing by overcoming various crises. We need to move forward by following the logic of historical progress, and develop by riding the tide of development of our times,” said Xi at the virtual session.  Xi’s insightful remarks embody the scientific methodology of dialectical materialism, providing important guidance for grasping the trend of history and riding the waves of the times in the turbulent international situation.  Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, believes that Xi’s speech pointed the way to a better future for China and the world.  In the face of profound and extensive changes of the times, countries can only see clearly the right direction for human society through the “telescope” of history.  Although the once-in-a-century pandemic has created many obstacles to the communication between peoples of different countries, facts have shown once again that countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which their shared destiny hinges. Only through cooperation can they usher in a brighter future.  The recovery and development of the world economy are faced with many constraints, but economic globalization has never and will not veer off course. Only by building an open world economy can countries fully unleash the vitality of the world economy.  Although problems like a widening North-South gap, divergent recovery trajectories, development fault-lines and technology divisions become more prominent, mankind’s beautiful dream of common development will never fade. Only by adhering to a people-centered philosophy of development can countries realize balanced development worldwide and revitalize global development.  Despite the resurgence of Cold War mentality, protectionism and unilateralism, peaceful development and win-win cooperation remain the right way forward for humanity. Different countries and civilizations can open up new space for global peaceful development only by prospering together on the basis of respect for each other, and seeking common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences.  In the face of the profound and sweeping changes of the times, the international community must forge ahead with confidence and fortitude and push the wheel of history toward a brighter future with practical actions.  To take the initiative in the course of history, countries must pluck up the courage to overcome stubborn resistance and strong countercurrents along the way for a better future.  “We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges,” Xi said at the event.  He encouraged the international community to face the issues of the times and create a better future with actions.  Crises and opportunities are interconnected and dialectically united. Only by figuring out the way forward, grasping the general trend, observing the situation through dialectical thinking, gaining a deep understand of opportunities and challenges and actively creating conditions can countries turn crises into opportunities.  Since the outbreak of COVID-19, people from various countries have supported and helped each other, showing humankind’s courage, resolve and compassion in front of a major crisis and kindling a flame in the dark hour.  To build a better post-COVID world, the international community also needs to join hands to surmount all kinds of obstacles on the way forward with courage and strong will.  Throughout the history of humanity, human society has managed to progress no matter what kinds of risks, disasters or countercurrents were along the way. Humanity shall and will continue to stride forward.  As long as various parties follow the trend of history, embrace cooperation to defeat the virus, resolve various risks, bridge the development divide, and discard Cold War mentality, the international community will certainly create a better post-COVID world.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

A robot works at a smart textile factory of a company based in east China’s Jiangsu province, Jan. 13, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Hua Xuegen)  In 2021, China’s imports and exports totaled $6.05 trillion, passing the $6 trillion mark for the first time; and the country’s actual use of foreign capital reached a new record of nearly 1.15 trillion yuan ($181 billion).  As the data showed, China scored remarkable achievements in advancing economic development, making new strides in building a new development paradigm and witnessing new results in pursuing high-quality development.  China’s foreign trade performance mirrors the strong resilience and vitality of the Chinese economy. Last year, the country’s foreign trade surpassed the $5 trillion and $6 trillion marks, compared with over $4 trillion in the previous year.  China’s imports and exports with major trading partners achieved stable increase, and its trade models were further optimized in 2021.  During last year, private enterprises in the country played a more active role in foreign trade; the country’s imports and exports of mechanical and electrical products maintained a sound growth momentum; and the actual use of foreign capital in China’s high-tech industry and service sector climbed 17.1 percent and 16.7 percent respectively from the previous year. The country’s foreign trade and foreign investment inflow achieved steady improvement in both quantity and quality.  Against the background characterized by the blows of a massive epidemic, faster evolution of major changes unseen in a century in the world, and the increasingly complex, grim and uncertain external environment, China’s economy has maintained stable operation, with the foundation for industrial development constantly consolidated and vitality of economic development enhanced.    Customers select imported products in a convenience shop at Caofeidian comprehensive bonded zone, Tangshan city, north China’s Hebei province, Dec. 13, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/ Liu Mancang)  Many international economic organizations predicted that the year-on-year growth of China’s economy in 2021 surpassed the expected growth of other major economies.  China’s lead in the world in terms of COVID-19 containment has been a key underlying factor behind its globally leading position in pursuing economic development.  Faced with repeated variations of the virus, China sticks to the overall strategy of preventing imported cases and domestic re-infections and the “dynamic zero-case policy”, and continuously improves the vaccination coverage, laying solid underpinning for balancing epidemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development.  China has not only achieved stable operation of its own economy, but helped maintain the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain together with its trading partners, effectively propping up global fight against the virus and world economic recovery.  China’s role as an anchor and driver for the world economy is becoming more evident, which proves that China’s insistence on effectively coordinating COVID-19 responses with economic and social development and implementing prudent macroeconomic policies, a truly responsible move taken by a major country, is conducive to the recovery and development of the world economy.  China’s “magnetic attraction” to foreign investment continues to increase, demonstrating huge opportunities offered by the country’s super-large market.  China has a population of more than 1.4 billion and a middle-income group of more than 400 million people, which makes the scale and potential of its consumer market unparalleled. Besides, as the country boasts complete industrial supporting facilities, sound infrastructure, rich human resources and other prominent advantages, and has constantly improved its business environment, it will show greater appeal to foreign investors.  In 2022, China’s foreign direct investment (FDI) is expected to remain robust, according to a report recently released by KPMG.    Containers are loaded and unloaded at a well-lit container terminal of Haikou port, south China’s Hainan province, Oct. 20, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/ Wang Chenglong)  A survey conducted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) showed 97 percent of the companies surveyed plan to continuously increase their investment in China. Senior executives of many American enterprises also announced that they will expand their business in China in the next decade.  By advocating open cooperation and promoting the construction of an open world economy, China has enabled the rest of the world to share the dividends of its economic growth and prosperous consumption.  In 2021, the imports and exports of China’s comprehensive bonded zones, pilot free trade zones, and Hainan free trade port grew 24.3 percent, 26.4 percent, and 57.7 percent, respectively, signaling greater importance of the country’s platforms set up to promote opening-up.  China’s foreign trade with countries along the Belt and Road rose 23.6 percent year on year to 11.6 trillion yuan last year, 2.2 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of China’s foreign trade in the same period. The unimpeded trade between China and countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fully demonstrated how the high-quality joint construction of the BRI can stimulate the development of the world economy.

Facing a fresh wave of the highly contagious Omicron variant, countries are grappling to safeguard their citizens against infection—each in their own way. There are nations that have stuck to the Zero-COVID strategy in a bid to minimize transmission. There are countries that have rushed to boost their public with a view to reaching an optimal state of herd immunity.  Then there is the American strategy, a hotchpotch of inaction and counteraction that has plunged the nation into a public health anarchy. The COVID-19 map says it all. Zooming in on any coronavirus hot spot graphics, and you will find that, for most of the past two years, the American part dyed in ominous burgundy. With an appalling daily tally of some 800 thousand cases (nearly 140,000 COVID-19 patients have been hospitalized every single day), the US is marching at an alarming pace toward establishing its own model of herd immunity—not by vaccination but through mass infection.  America's COVID-19 fiasco, a slow-motion tragedy where everything that could go wrong has gone wrong, has been jointly inflicted by its incompetent and irresolute politicians, the divided and centrifugal states, as well as the misleading and conflicting media and so-called pundits.  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy when dereliction of duty goes unchecked and apathy to human life and science is tolerated or even applauded.  Back in early 2020, former US President Donald Trump eagerly dismissed the infectious disease as a hoax hatched by the Democrats and a "Kung Flu," having opted instead to throw more energy behind his own reelection bid than to urge the public to wear masks and get vaccinated. Under his watch, the US lost over 400,000 lives to the disease, of which at least 130,000 people died unnecessarily, according to Deborah Birx, Trump's former coronavirus response coordinator.  But has former US President Trump been held to account for his mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis? Not in the slightest. He was in fact been impeached twice and is still in the crosshairs for his role in the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Yet he escaped scot-free from the public health disaster he left behind.  The former New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, has also taken his spot in the long line of politicians who have not been held accountable for their negligence in bungling the COVID-19 response. Last year, the star governor resigned in disgrace. His undoing? Harassment allegations, rather than the fact that he ordered nursing homes to take back infected residents, letting the virus loose in those most vulnerable places in his state. Unlike Trump, he was subject to an investigation for his role in the state's nursing home horror. But the result that came out earlier this month found that he was not liable for any criminal charges.  Also, the same goes for Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who himself was infected with the virus last August and yet has still spared in no effort to block every vaccine or mask mandate. Not to mention Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who let almost a million rapid COVID-19 tests expire as they sat idly in a warehouse. And congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently received what has been her only dose of punishment—permanently suspension from Twitter—after waging her misinformation frenzy on the social media platform (including concocting a falsehood that there has been "extremely high amounts" of COVID-vaccine-related deaths)…  Do these politicians really have grave doubts over vaccine efficacy? Clearly not. Greg Abbott received his booster and Ron DeSantis has gotten at least two shots (he refused to clarify whether he is boosted). Yet they would rather shirk their responsibility to nudge the public to follow suit, which will have ZERO consequences, other than offending anti-vaccination voters, which would otherwise taint their political future.    People wait for COVID-19 test in the Queens borough of New York, United States, Dec. 29, 2021. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)  When politicians refuse or fail to devise and implement a clear roadmap, then chances are that baffled and worn-out citizens will make selfish decisions in the name of freedom. Meanwhile, the media will feed the furor and profit from this costly freedom under the banner of "freedom of speech"—when no one, in the end, is to be held responsible for spewing out misinformation.  Just take a look at the star-struck Fox News channel, a petri dish of COVID-related "alternative facts," where masks, vaccine mandates, social distancing rules, and school closures taken as preemptive measures are often the subject of censuring in shows hosted by celebrity anchors. For Fox News hosts, facts appear to matter far less than political grandstanding. When they constantly churn out conspiracy theories or anti-science rhetoric that clearly go against CDC guidelines and even common sense, their staunch viewers ultimately bear the brunt—a Kaiser Family Foundation study has found 36% of surveyed Fox News views either believed in or were unsure about four or more false statements, one of the highest. Still, there is zero accountability.  Voters and viewers take sides, but the virus respects no party affiliations. It feeds on misinformation and it flourishes when politicians are unaccountable and the media and so-called pundits trade in science-based facts for ratings. When politicians and celebrity hosts have nothing to lose, they of course won't prioritize people's lives in the first place.  On January 3, the US logged a horrific record of one million cases, an astronomical number compared to most countries' case counts. As of January 16, over 850,000 lives have been lost to COVID-19 in America. It's tragic, it's alarming and it's above all sickening. With the US keen on slamming China's Zero-COVID strategy, why not save some energy to reexamine its own laissez-faire and zero-accountability approach first?&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Greater public involvement in winter sports also contributes to the Olympic Movement. We will spare no effort to present a great Games to the world. The world is turning its eyes to China, and China is ready,” said Chinese President in his 2022 New Year address.    A running enthusiast passes a sign for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games with Chinese characteristics on Aoti Middle Road, Beijing, Nov. 24, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/Chen Xiaogen)  The Beijing 2022, accompanied by people’s wishes for and expectations of the new year, will soon kick off. Looking back on China’s over six years of preparations for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, the country, guided by the vision of hosting “green, inclusive, open and clean” Olympic Winter Games, has made continuous efforts and steady progress with every passing day, which makes it more confident and better prepared during the sprint for the sports event.  All 12 competition venues for the Beijing 2022 filled with sci-tech elements are completed, and operation teams of the venues are already in the Games-time state.  The finishing touches to and improvements on non-competition venues are gathering pace, and the three Olympic Villages for the Beijing 2022 are well dressed. Besides, the renovation of venues for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Beijing 2022 has been successfully completed.  The Beijing, Yanqing, and Zhangjiakou competition zones of the Beijing 2022, which are located in Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the co-host city in north China’s Hebei province, are all ready to welcome guests from across the world.  From Oct. 5 to the end of December last year, eight of the 12 competition venues hosted 10 international competitions, three training weeks and two domestic trials in an orderly manner, with the aim of testing all factors of the Games. These competitions and activities were joined by over 2,000 overseas athletes, team officials, and other personnel.    Children practice skating under the instruction of a coach at a park in Urumqi, northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Jan. 9, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Zhang Xiuke)  Such all-factor tests, which featured closed-loop management throughout the process for safety amid COVID-19 and accorded with the operation standards in actual competitions, are believed to lay a solid underpinning for ensuring the safe and smooth hosting of the Beijing 2022 as scheduled.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has received “unanimously positive” feedback from athletes in the Beijing 2022 test series, according to IOC sports director Kit McConnell.  The venues they were experiencing in Beijing are absolutely outstanding, noted McConnell. “There is a lot of excitement from them, not only regarding the participation at these events but looking forward to their participation in Beijing in just a few months. It is great to see their feedback both on the technical side and their personal excitement,” he said.  China is stretching out its arms to greet outstanding winter sports athletes from various countries. These athletes, who have superb athletic skills gained through repeated practice and are pursuing beautiful dreams with perseverance, will gather together in China under the Olympic flag.  Athletes are both opponents in competitions and messengers of the Olympic values of excellence, friendship, respect, and solidarity. They inspire each other and help each other improve their performance.  Olympic Games are like a miniature version of the global village, where athletes, while trying their best for dreams and honor, live under the same roof in Olympic Villages. By communicating with each other, they get to know the distinctive charms of different cultures and sow the seeds of peace, friendship and progress in all directions, turning the world into a united team.  Aiming to link countries more closely via sports, the Beijing 2022 serves as a grand stage where numerous good stories will take place.  In 2021, the IOC amended the Olympic motto for the first time in over a century, adding into which the word “together”. The new motto now reads “Faster, Higher, Stronger-Together”.    Foreigners take selfies with official mascots of the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games—Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon in Beijing, Jan. 12, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Guo Junfeng)  The revision represents a clear message sent by the Olympic Movement to the world, and harmonizes with the idea of building a community with a shared future for mankind.  By holding a simple, safe and excellent Winter Olympic Games, China will inject impetus into the irresistible trend of the times characterized by peace, development and win-win cooperation.  Chinese wisdom, Chinese solutions and Chinese strength, together with the Olympic Movement, will add strong momentum to the construction of a better world.  Engaging more people in ice and snow sports is an inherent purpose of the Olympic Movement.  The 2022 Winter Olympic Games will connect the Chinese people with the world, and the country’s vision of involving 300 million people in ice and snow sports will change the history of winter sports forever, pointed out Thomas Bach, President of the IOC.  As a firm promoter and practitioner of the Olympic spirit and the Olympic Movement, China is unfolding a splendid scroll painting depicting winter sports in front of the world.  As the COVID-19 epidemic rages across the world, the Olympic spirit and the power of sports play unique and crucial roles in countries’ joint response to the challenge. People in various countries are looking forward to the opening of the Beijing 2022, which will be an occasion when the value of passion and dreams, courage and strength, as well as teamwork and solidarity will be applauded by the whole world.  Let us all expect the moment when the Olympic torch lights up the sky in Beijing and makes the flame of hope shine in everyone’s heart.  Let us all work together for a shared future!&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

The 2021 China-Africa Innovation Cooperation Conference is held. (Photo/Hubei Daily)  Over a month ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping summarized the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation at the eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, where he also raised four proposals to build a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.  At the conference, he announced that China will work closely with African countries to implement nine programs of China-Africa practical cooperation.  After the conference concluded, a series of relevant activities were held, including the 2021 China-Africa Innovation Cooperation Conference, and the launching of a group of China-Africa Joint Centers for Modern Agrotechnology Exchange, Demonstration &amp;Training.  China and Eritrea decided to elevate their relations to a strategic partnership. China and Kenya inked a series of cooperation documents on digital economy, investment, agriculture and export of Kenyan agricultural products to China. Besides, China said it would help the Comoros achieve universal immunization within a year, completely eliminate malaria in the Comoros by 2025, and support the Comoros Emerging Plan for 2030.  These concrete actions to implement the outcomes of the eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation are deepening and substantiating the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.  The mutual assistance and solidarity demonstrated by China and Africa amid the COVID-19 pandemic manifests the spirit of building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.  Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has offered 120 batches of emergency medical supplies for 53 African countries and the African Union (AU), delivering these materials to each and every African country and region. Besides, almost all African countries have received China’s COVID-19 vaccines.  When Africa was facing a new round of COVID-19 resurgence, President Xi announced that China will provide another one billion doses of vaccines to Africa, to help the AU achieve its goal of vaccinating 60 percent of the African population by 2022.    Photo shows the Kipevu Oil Terminal in Mombasa, Kenya. (Photo/CGTN)  At present, this largest-ever aid plan for Africa is well underway. Batches of Chinese vaccines are being shipped to every corner of the African continent, crossing mountains and seas.  These actions prove that China will always stand firmly with Africa and work with it to achieve the final victory in the fight against the pandemic.  China is the largest developing country, and Africa is the continent with the largest number of developing countries. The mutual assistance between the two sides when they are pursuing economic development and national rejuvenation will help enhance the common welfare of the 2.7 billion people in both China and Africa.  China has always been following the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pursuing the greater good and shared interests in its cooperation with Africa. The two sides have built over 10,000 kilometers of railways, nearly 100,000 kilometers of highways, nearly 1,000 bridges and 100 ports, as well as a large number of hospitals and schools.  Recently, a Chinese company built oil terminal at the port of Mombasa, Kenya was completed. It is another witness to the sincere friendship between China and Africa and a joyful result of the cooperation between the two sides under the Belt and Road Initiative, heralding a bright prospect of the two sides on their way to modernization.  As long as China and Africa keep maintaining their solidarity and cooperation, they will definitely explore a new path for developing countries to achieve modernization.  Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said he is often asked why Kenya and China cooperate so closely, and he told them, because China and Kenya respect each other and treat each other as equals. What he said exactly explains why China and Africa enjoy sustaining friendship and cooperation.  China never attaches political strings in its cooperation with Africa, or forces the latter to do anything. The country always sees Africa as a broad stage for international cooperation rather than an arena for competition among major countries. If there is any competition, then we should compare who has done more for Africa, who has contributed more to Africa, and who has worked more for the African people.    Photo shows the Kipevu Oil Terminal in Mombasa, Kenya. (Photo/CGTN)  China is sincere in offering assistance to African countries, and is willing to cooperate with all countries in the world to develop Africa. The African people know clearly who their real friend is. President of Eritrea Isaias Afwerki called China an indispensable and true development partner of Africa, and hoped that China could play a bigger role in Africa's peace and development process.  The spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation, which features sincere friendship and equality, win-win for mutual benefit and common development, fairness and justice, and progress with the times and openness and inclusiveness, will be carried on from generation to generation.  Joining hands for modernization and the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, China and Africa will surely write a glorious chapter in the history of human civilization.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

Photo taken on the morning of Jan. 4, 2022 shows Chinese President Xi Jinping visiting the National Speed Skating Oval in Beijing on an inspection tour on the preparatory work for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. (Xinhua/Xie Huanchi)  Xi’s remarks have fully demonstrated China’s confidence in fulfilling its solemn commitment to the international community to deliver a successful Beijing 2022 and manifested the aspiration of a positive, prosperous and open China to embrace the world and create a beautiful future together with the rest of the world.  Hosting a successful 2022 Games is China’s delightful promise to the world. On July 31, 2015, Beijing, together with Zhangjiakou city in north China’s Hebei province, won the bid to host the 24th Olympic Winter Games, also known as the 2022 Winter Olympics, at the 128th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session.  On the same day, Xi sent a congratulatory letter to the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games bid delegation, stressing that China will strive to deliver a fantastic, extraordinary and excellent Olympics in 2022.  “We will fulfill all our commitments and witness, together with the people of all countries and the IOC, the advent of a new phase in the development of the Olympic winter sports and in the spread of the Olympic spirit,” said Xi in his letter to IOC President Thomas Bach on July 31, 2015.  Over the past more than six years, China has made unremitting efforts to fulfill its solemn commitment to the international community. The country has promoted the ideas of hosting the Games in a green, sharing, open and clean manner and delivering a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic Games.    The first train custom-made for the Beijing Winter Olympics sets off from Qinghe Railway Station in Beijing on the high-speed railway linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the co-host cities of the 2022 Winter Games, Jan. 6, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Shi Wenzhe)  The IOC has always made positive remarks on China’s preparations for the Beijing 2022 and fully acknowledged the country’s contribution to the international Olympic cause.  In October 2016, Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., Chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games and then vice president of the IOC, praised the Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games for getting off to a very fast start in the preparatory work and pointed out that initial preparations were on the right track.  After visiting proposed venues for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in Zhangjiakou and Beijing before a meeting with Xi in January 2019, Bach said he was deeply impressed with China’s pragmatic, efficient, and vitalized preparations for the Games.  “We are looking forward to successful Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and we have great confidence, built on our experience, that we will stage safe and secure Olympic Winter Games for everybody,” Bach said in his New Year’s Message 2022 published on the IOC official website on Dec. 31, 2021. He believes that “these Winter Games will open a new era for winter sports globally.”  In a recent interview with Chinese media, Samaranch said he believes that China will stage a splendid Olympic Games for the world.  Filled with confidence in China, the international community is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Beijing 2022 and looks forward to new surprises Beijing has prepared for the world.  In 2008, China successfully hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which represented a perfect answer given by the country to the third of the well-known three questions raised by “Tianjin Youth” magazine in 1908: “When could China send an athlete to participate in an Olympic Games?” “When could China send a delegation to an Olympic Games?” “When could China host an Olympic Games?”    Elementary school students practice skiing skills at a ski resort in Altay city, northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Jan. 6, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Aldark)  This year, the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people will embrace the Olympic Movement again. By delivering a “fantastic, extraordinary and excellent” Olympics in 2022, China will promote the popularization and development of ice and snow sports and enhance understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and peoples of various countries around the world.  Over the past years, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway connecting the three competition zones of the Beijing 2022, the world’s first intelligent high-speed train with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, was officially put into operation; the National Ski Jumping Center and the National Speed Skating Oval, which are nicknamed the “Snow Ruyi” and the “Ice Ribbon” respectively, were completed; the National Aquatics Center, known as the “Water Cube”, was transformed into “Ice Cube” for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games; and the country’s vision of engaging 300 million people in winter sports across China has been realized ahead of schedule.  Through these achievements made during the preparations for the Beijing 2022, people around the world have witnessed how the Chinese people have worked hard for their dreams in the new era.  As the COVID-19 is still wreaking havoc worldwide, the Beijing 2022 bears the task of deepening mutual understanding and exchanges between peoples around the world through the Olympic Movement.  In December 2021, the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Beijing Winter Olympic Truce Resolution drafted by China and the IOC. The resolution expressed “the expectation that the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will be a meaningful opportunity to harness the power of sport to advance the world by fostering an atmosphere of peace, development, resilience, tolerance and understanding.”  Many multilateral mechanisms, including the 10th Olympic Summit, the Group of 20, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the China-CELAC Forum, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have voiced strong support for the Beijing 2022.  The international community’s support for the Games has demonstrated the aspiration of various parties to pull together in times of trouble, defeat the pandemic, safeguard peace, and work together for a shared future.  It’s believed that the Beijing 2022 will be an unforgettable occasion when the world will be brought together in the Olympic spirit of peace, solidarity and friendship.  The heroic motto of the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Games, “Together for a Shared Future”, represents China’s sincere invitation to various parties to join hands on the way forward.  China will surely live up to the expectations of the IOC, which believes Beijing is a “safe and historical” choice for hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, and the Beijing 2022 will make a big splash in the history of the Olympic Movement.

Photo taken on Jan. 2, 2022 shows the Qingdao Area of China (Shandong) Pilot Free Trade Zone in east China's Shandong province. (People’s Daily Online/Han Jiajun)  As the most promising free trade area covering the largest population and most diverse membership, the RCEP fully demonstrates the confidence and resolution of relevant parties in jointly safeguarding multilateralism and free trade, and promoting regional economic integration.  It will further integrate industrial and supply chains in the region and promote cross-border trade and investment, injecting new momentum for regional and global economic recovery.  The world is going through profound changes and a pandemic unseen in a century, and economic globalization running up against headwinds from rising unilateralism and protectionism.  Member countries of the RCEP, which have different social systems, come from different cultural backgrounds, and are in different development stages, have implemented the modern, comprehensive, high-quality, and mutually beneficial free trade agreement as scheduled.  They once again proved with concrete actions that economic globalization is irreversible, and openness and integration an unstoppable historical trend. They also proved that to safeguard multilateralism, adhere to opening cooperation, promote free trade and strive for common prosperity is a common aspiration of regional countries and their peoples, as well as the right choice to cope with challenges and promote win-win cooperation.    A representative of the Liuzhou branch of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade issues the first RCEP Certificate of Origin in Liuzhou, south China’s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, to Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor, Jan. 1, 2022. (People’s Daily/Li Hanchi)  The RCEP, officially entering into force, will significantly promote regional economic integration and boost regional trade and investment. With a number of promises made on the opening of cargo and service trade, as well as investment, the free trade pact offers institutional guarantee for trade and investment facilitation, and more than 90 percent of merchandise trade between approved members will eventually be subject to zero tariffs under the pact.  The RCEP will further integrate the industrial and supply chains in the Asia-Pacific region, energize regional investment, and give play to the complementary advantages of member countries in technology, manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors.  The RCEP is expected to help its members increase export, stocks of outbound investment and GDP by 10.4 percent, 2.6 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, compared with the baseline, by 2025. This will greatly mitigate the negative impacts from COVID-19 on regional economy and enhance the confidence of the world in economic recovery.  Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanawisit noted that the implementation of the RCEP will create a favorable external environment for the development of its member countries and enhance their resilience in coping with economic challenges.  The RCEP implementation marks a new milestone for China's opening-up. As the largest economy among the members of the free trade agreement, China has conformed to the trend of regional cooperation and development, and was the first to have ratified the RCEP.    Vehicles are being loaded onto an oceangoing roll-on-roll-off ship for exportation at a terminal in Lianyungang, east China’s Jiangsu province, Jan. 3, 2022. (People’s Daily/Wang Chun)  China is a huge market with over 1.4 billion people and more than 400 million middle-income earners. It imports around $2.5 trillion of merchandise and services on an annual basis. The country will provide broader market space for regional economic development and support it with a diverse industrial system, and better join the integrated development of industrial and supply chains in the region and the construction of an integrated market, so as to contribute its strength to the promotion of regional prosperity and global recovery.  China, unswervingly promoting high-level opening up, has demonstrated the confidence and inclusiveness of a major country, as well as its broad mind to seek interests for all.  Implementing a free trade zone upgrading strategy and forging a network of high-standard free trade zones are important measures of China to build a new system for higher-level open economy and foster a new development paradigm.  So far, China has inked free trade pacts with 26 partners, and its trade volume with these partners account for around 35 percent of the country’s total. It is seeing comprehensive improvement in its cargo and service trade, investment, as well as institutional openness.  The RCEP will serve as a bridge for China that connects domestic and international circulations, and brings closer both domestic and international markets and resources. It will better align domestic and international rules, and further vitalize the country’s opening up and innovation.  As long as China conforms to economic globalization to create opportunities while opening up and tackle problems through cooperation, and to work with other countries with strong confidence, it will be able to dispel the shadow cast by the COVID-19 pandemic over the global economy and create a brighter future together with the rest of the world.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

There is something that can catch me off guard whenever I watch a Hollywood film or stream a TV show in foreign languages: the Chinese characters, the Chinese elements, the Chinese food… As much as I am amused by how irrelevantly the Chinese proverbs are recited or how bizarrely Chinese cuisine is cooked and consumed, I often find myself cringing at the way those Chinese cast members look—foxy eyes, high cheekbones, flat faces with heavy makeup—in troupes, in sequels, in series. If there is a cinematic universe of Chinese characters, the audience must have trouble telling them apart.  Every now and then, that feeling overflows from the big screen and lands on a random fashion show, a magazine cover, or a printout of a commercial poster. One question tugs on my mind: why do Chinese have to "look" (or be portrayed) like that—all the time? That's why I can't appreciate commercials made by Three Squirrels (a Chinese snack retailer) or Mercedes-Benz, both of which feature models with cosmetics-induced slanted eyes.  My bewilderment arises not from how grotesque their countenances are (they sure have their own styles should they appear in personal makeup tutorials), but from the fact that by appearing in popular commercials with cosmetics-induced slanted eyes, they, unconsciously, are reinforcing a stereotype originated a century ago—that slanted eyes represent the common feature, the unique beauty shared by Chinese people.  The stereotypical depiction of Chinese could find its roots as early as the 19th century when Sinophobia and exclusionism were at their height in the West. The infamous racist cartoon The Yellow Terror in all His Glory published in 1899 illustrated just how Chinese people (and in a broader concept non-white) were vilified—a skinny figure with slanted and angry eyes who was presented as a menace to the Western world.  Even after China rose up against imperialism and started to assimilate itself into the world, that stereotype persisted. Not only were Chinese women often pigeonholed as the "China Doll" and Chinese men as the killers who specialized in Kung Fu, but they were also often treated as common tropes in Hollywood films like The Face of Fu Manchu, a 1965 thriller, with sallow faces and slanted eyes, all intentionally "fine-tuned" through makeup.  "Slanted eyes" isn't just a racist symbol of the past, it is a stereotypical cliché that flourishes to this day. In the modern fashion industry, a pair of slanted eyes can be deemed as a classic beauty typology; and sometimes, it becomes the vogue for models to compete to appropriate from this or that culture. In the field of sports, on the other hand, it is occasionally deployed as a weapon to belittle Asian opponents—a blatant racist move and a departure from sportsmanship.  The special preference for "slanted eyes"—whether as a peculiar taste or as a racism-driven weapon—is just an embodiment of Orientalism, which Edward Saïd, an American academic, defines as "a Western style of dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient." Slanted eyes, or foxy eyes—it isn't the way most Chinese people actually look like. It isn't what most Chinese think beauty is. IT IS what the West thinks a Chinese person should look like, or where his or her uniqueness lies.  On Jan. 3, the BBC published an article examining the heated debate surrounding the slanted eyes controversy. Good for them that they acknowledged that "slanted eyes" have their racist roots. But at the same time they biasedly (what a surprise) mixed up "slanted eyes" with "small, narrow, and thin" eyes, and claimed that the episode mirrored the Chinese society's "rejection of aesthetic pluralism". It's poles apart between "slanted eyes"—which is the product of makeup or the racist gestures—and "small, narrow, or thin" eyes, which some people are born with naturally and shouldn't be ashamed of. Besides, of the billions of different appearances, it is unreasonable to always highlight an outdated and stereotypical flaw—that's not a showcase of "aesthetic pluralism" but a reinforcement of Orientalism and aesthetic hegemony.  Aesthetics evolve, but stereotypes remain—this should become the real focus of the discussion. Asians are good at math. Chinese have foxy eyes. Indians have a heavy accent… We are marching forward in the second decade of the 21st century with marvelous scientific advancements and continually shifting aesthetic tastes, shouldn't we also then just leave these stinky and decayed stereotypes behind?&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Snow is being made on the Big Air Shougang, a sports stadium located in Shijingshan district, Beijing, built to host the big air events of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Jan. 3, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ He Luqi)  The year 2021 is of milestone and historic significance for China. It witnessed the holding of the grand gathering celebrating the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), where CPC general secretary Xi Jinping solemnly announced the completion of the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.  His firm statement, summarizing past experience and aiming to make new progress, demonstrated the responsibility of the CPC to seek happiness for the people, rejuvenation for the nation, progress for humanity, and harmony for the world.  In the past year, the world experienced a persistent and unchecked pandemic and accelerating changes unseen in a century. These have once again put the world in another crossroads of history.  Whether should we act out of the common good of humanity to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, advocate openness and win-win results, and promote equality and respect, or revert to a Cold War mentality, provoke division and antagonism, and stoke confrontation between blocs? The trial of strength between these two trends has a profound impact on the future of mankind.  One’s competence is shown in trials and tribulations. Over the past year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping at its core, major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, focusing on the main tasks of serving national rejuvenation and promoting human progress, has drawn wisdom from the hundred-year history of the CPC, and proceeded from an insightful grasp of the general trend of human development, the grand scheme of things amid global changes, and the entire course of Chinese history.    China-made vehicles are being loaded onto an oceangoing roll-on-roll-off ship for exportation, Jan. 3, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Wang Chun)  Upholding the banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind, China has broken new ground in its diplomatic endeavors amid profound global changes and turned crises into opportunities amid complex situations on the international stage. The country has steadfastly forged ahead through struggle as well as cooperation.  “China has embarked on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. As China enters a new development stage, we will follow a new development philosophy and foster a new development paradigm. We will build a new system of open economy of higher standards, create a more attractive business environment, and advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. We hope to work with countries in the Asia-Pacific and beyond to achieve higher-standard mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.”  “The CPC has a grand and simple goal, which is essentially about delivering a better life to all Chinese people.”  “The Chinese people's aspiration for a better life is the biggest internal driver for China's development and an inevitable trend of history, and any attempt to stop this trend will be rejected by the Chinese people and will by no means succeed.”  These stories and philosophy of the CPC and China told by Xi, also the President of China, demonstrated to the world that no matter what changes are taking place on the international stage, China will continue to place its own development in the coordinate system of human development, seeing that the interests of the Chinese people are integrated with the common interests of the peoples of other countries, and the Chinese dream connected with the dreams of the people in the rest of the world, so as to bring new hopes and opportunities to the world and make newer and greater contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. At the same time, China will also make unswerving efforts to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests.  On the new journey, China will follow a path of peaceful development. For any country or nation to achieve rejuvenation, it must follow the logic of history and the trend of the times in their pursuit of progress and development. China will stay committed to peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit and follow an independent foreign policy of peace, so as to achieve development by upholding world peace and promote world peace through its own development.    Photo shows a night view of the Xiangyang ancient town, central China’s Hubei province, Jan. 2, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/ Yang Dong)  China’s commitment to peace doesn’t mean that China is a weak country subject to the bullying by others. The Chinese are a people who uphold justice and are not intimidated by threats of force. As a nation, they have a strong sense of pride and confidence. They have never bullied, oppressed, or subjugated the people of any other country, and they never will. By the same token, they will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or subjugate them.  On the new journey, China will follow a path of reform and opening up. Just as President Xi promised at the fourth China International Import Expo, China will not change its resolve to open wider at a high standard; it will not change its determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world; and it will not change its commitment to an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all.  To expand opening up doesn’t necessarily mean that China will lose itself. Throughout human history, no nation or country has ever become strong and prosperous by relying on external forces, indiscriminately copying the models of other countries, or blindly following in others’ footsteps. China learns whatever lessons it can learn from the achievements of other cultures, and adheres to independent development, stressing reliance on its own efforts to drive the nation’s development, and maintaining that China’s affairs must be decided and run by the Chinese people themselves.  On the new journey, China will follow a path of multilateralism. There is only one Earth and one shared future for humanity. As we cope with the current crisis and endeavor to make a better day for everyone, we need to stand united and work together.  China will firmly keep practicing real multilateralism, and safeguard the international system with the UN as the core, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms governing international relations embodied in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.  It will also work with other countries under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to explore new ideas and new models of cooperation and keep enriching the practice of multilateralism under new circumstances.  To safeguard multilateralism, one must firmly oppose unilateralism. China will keep working with other countries to oppose unilateral practices under the disguise of multilateralism, and oppose hegemonism and power politics, so as to safeguard international justice and equity.  China always stands on the right side of history, advances with human progress, speaks for international equity and justice, and supports the vast developing countries. On the new journey in the new era, China will write a new chapter of win-win cooperation together with all the peace-loving countries and peoples.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

On Dec. 29, the Hong Kong Police Force arrested senior staff members of Stand News, an online news platform based in Hong Kong, for conspiracy to publish seditious publications, while the Security Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government froze relevant assets of the platform according to the law.  However, the necessary actions of justice taken by the Hong Kong Police Force against Stand News, which were aimed at safeguarding national security and Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, have been maliciously discredited by some politicians in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Britain, as well as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).  Ignoring right and wrong, these people have willfully misrepresented the lawful actions taken by the Hong Kong Police Force, vainly attempting to use press freedom as a shield for criminal acts and hamper the rule of law in Hong Kong through the straw-man trick.  China strongly deplores and firmly opposes such acts of brazen interference in China’s internal affairs.  Hong Kong is a society under the rule of law where it enforces laws and regulations and prosecutes any illegal acts.  The Crimes Ordinance in Hong Kong clearly stipulates that any person who without lawful excuse has in his possession any seditious publication shall be guilty of an offense. Stand News, though in the guise of media outlet, is by nature a political organization.  It fueled violent activities of the black-clad rioters and instigated acts of undermining the rule of law in Hong Kong during the social turbulence over the extradition bill.  After the national security law in Hong Kong came into force, the organization still obstinately opposed China and created chaos in Hong Kong and constantly published articles inciting people to use violence and even split the country. Relevant activities of the organization constitute gross violations of the law.  As a Chinese saying goes, “He who is unjust is doomed to destruction.” By arresting individuals suspected of conspiring to publish seditious publications and freezing relevant assets according to the law, the Hong Kong government has safeguarded national security of China, the rule of law and public order in Hong Kong. Relevant lawful actions have gained firm support from various sectors of the Hong Kong society.  Distorting facts and discrediting the law enforcement actions taken by the Hong Kong Police Force under the guise of upholding press freedom, certain politicians in some Western countries, including the U.S., have already exposed their true intentions of disturbing the stability and order in Hong Kong.  According to reports, at least 117 reporters were arrested or detained in the U.S. in 2020, a surge of 12 times from 2019.  While touting the so-called “free and independent media”, using press freedom as a political tool to get their way, and wantonly smearing and attacking other countries in the name of press freedom, these politicians have turned a blind eye to the worsening press freedom situation in their own countries, which represents typical hegemonic acts and double standards.  By trying to use press freedom to help anti-China rioters in Hong Kong escape legal punishment and seek extra-legal privileges for them, certain Western politicians vainly attempt to make sure anti-China forces continue to disrupt Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Such evil political manipulation is doomed to failure.  It’s universal truth that freedom has its limits and anyone who violates the law must be punished. No country or region in the world allows news and speech to go unregulated by law. Anyone who engages in activities endangering national security and undermining the rule of law and social order under the guise of journalism will be punished according to the law.  The Basic Law of the HKSAR and the national security law in the region protect rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents in accordance with the law, including freedom of speech and press.  Anyone without prejudice cannot deny the fact that since the national security law took effect, the development of Hong Kong has returned to the right track and press freedom has enjoyed stronger guarantee in a safe, stable, and law-based environment.  As of April this year, 628 foreign employees working for overseas media held work visas in Hong Kong, 98, or 18.5 percent more than that of the same period last year. Many media outlets in the U.S. and Britain have sent more foreign staff to Hong Kong. These facts serve as convincing evidence that press freedom is fully guaranteed in Hong Kong.  Facts brook no distortion, and the prevailing trend of the times is irresistible. The irresponsible remarks made by Western politicians about press freedom in Hong Kong will never change the objective reality of Hong Kong’s flourishing media industry and freedom of the press, obstruct Hong Kong’s transition from chaos to stability and prosperity on its new historical journey, or China’s determined steps toward the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  External forces that attempt to stir up trouble for Hong Kong by confounding black and white and defaming the rule of law in the region had better immediately stop disrupting the HKSAR government’s exercising law-based governance on the pretext of press freedom and stop meddling in China’s internal affairs, including Hong Kong affairs.

By delivering their voices to the NPC, he is bringing more labor security to the people in flexible employment.    Residents elect deputies to the National People’s Congress at a polling station in Zhanggong district, Ganzhou, east China’s Jiangxi province, Sept. 13, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/Hu Jiangtao)  In Wenling, east China’s Zhejiang province, a consultation meeting was held on a renovation project of old residential complexes in a neighborhood. The meeting, joined by a number of government officials, residents in the neighborhood, and professionals, delivered a renovation plan that pleased all parties.  These two stories, which are told in a recently published documentary titled "Pursuing Common Values of Humanity: Chinese Stories on Democracy, Freedom and Human Rights," exactly demonstrate the vitality of the Chinese democracy and mirror the Chinese wisdom that lights up the whole-process people's democracy.  As it is said in the white paper China: Democracy That Works published by the State Council Information Office, China's democracy is thriving alongside those of other countries in the garden of civilizations.  China has created and developed whole-process people's democracy in line with its national conditions. This is a form of democracy with distinctive Chinese features which at the same time reflects humanity's universal desire for democracy. It has fueled the development of the country and driven the revitalization of the nation. It has contributed a new model to the international political spectrum.  In promoting democracy, China has undergone a difficult process of selection, experimentation, practice and development. Whole-process people's democracy contributes China's ideas and solutions to the political progress of humanity.  A sound and genuine democracy must allow the people to become masters of the country. It must allow them to enjoy the right to stand for election, the right to vote, and the right to extensive participation. It must allow them the right to express their expectations and the right to have those expectations.    Villagers elect deputies to the National People’s Congress of Dayang township and Luyang district at a polling station in Dayang village, Dayang township, Luyang district, Hefei, east China’s Anhui province, Nov. 30, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/Ge Chuanhong)  China did not follow the established path of Western countries in its modernization drive. Similarly, China did not duplicate Western models of democracy, but created its own. Now, the entire Chinese population, almost one fifth of the world's total, enjoys extensive rights and freedoms. This is most encouraging to developing countries and greatly enhances their confidence in developing their own democracy. China's new approach to democracy represents a significant contribution to international politics and human progress.  Whole-process people's democracy offers Chinese experiences for other countries to develop the most suitable form of democracy in accordance with their own characteristics and realities. China’s democratic practices indicate that only democracy rooted in a country's unique social environment has proven to be reliable and effective, and can thrive and progress.  Countries can borrow from the successful experience of others and develop forms of democracy suited to their own modernization process, but they should not simply duplicate other systems or models.  China never seeks to export the Chinese model of democracy. On the contrary, it firmly supports the independent choice by every country of its own path to democracy, and opposes any interference in others' internal affairs on the pretext of "bringing democracy".  Democracy manifests itself in two dimensions: On a national level, it refers to the people's status as masters of their own country; on an international level, it refers to the democratic relations between nations.    Deputies to the National People’s Congress solicit opinions from residents in Jinjiang community, Hepinglu neighborhood, Runzhou district, Zhenjiang, east China’s Jiangsu province, Nov. 12, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/Shi Yucheng)  China is a faithful and exemplary actor in pursuing, exploring and practicing democracy. It endeavors to increase democracy both within its own territory and between nations.  From proposing to build a community with a shared future, to promoting cooperation and common progress in economy and science, and from pursuing the greater good and shared interests and applying the principles of sincerity, affinity, good faith and real results in strengthening cooperation with other developing countries, to advancing the Belt and Road cooperation, China has always been standing on the right side of history.  Promoting democracy in international relations, championing peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, and building a new model of international relations, China is making the global governance system fairer and more equitable.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

Residents in Qianxibian village, Tangya township, Jindong district, Jinhua city, east China’s Zhejiang province, count votes in an election for officials for the villagers’ committee, Nov. 26, 2020. (People’s Daily Online/Yang Meiqing)  Among more than one million pieces of advice and suggestions made online, the advice of “mutual-aid elderly care” from a netizen with the username “Yun Fan” was included in the proposals for the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035, and eventually became a concrete measure in the document.  The story serves as a vivid demonstration of the fact that China’s democracy is translated into concrete and pragmatic practices.  “Whole-process people’s democracy in China is a complete system with supporting mechanisms and procedures, and has been fully tested through wide participation,” said a white paper titled “China: Democracy That Works” issued by the country’s State Council Information Office.  Thoroughly expounding the practice of the whole-process people’s democracy in China, the document pointed out that the whole-process people’s democracy is a comprehensive and coordinated system involving extensive and regular participation.  Whole-process people’s democracy operates a democratic system covering a population of more than 1.4 billion from 56 ethnic groups of a vast country, making possible the wide and sustained participation of all the people in the country, according to the white paper.  Whether the people enjoy democratic rights depends on whether they have the right to vote in elections and whether they have the right to continuously participate in political affairs in their everyday life.    Residents in Qianxibian village, Tangya township, Jindong district, Jinhua city, east China’s Zhejiang province, cast their ballots to elect officials for the villagers’ committee, Nov. 26, 2020. (People’s Daily Online/Yang Meiqing)  In China’s practice of democracy, the country lays emphasis on both the role of electoral democracy and the advantages of consultative democracy, ensuring that people exercise their right to vote in elections and participate in state and social affairs through extensive consultations.  Integrating electoral democracy and consultative democracy, the whole-process people’s democracy in China consolidates the people’s principal position in the country’s political and social life and leaves no room for politicians to shower promises while campaigning and break them all once elected.  Whether the people enjoy democratic rights depends on whether they have the rights to take part in democratic elections, decision-making, management, and oversight.  By exercising their right to vote in elections, the Chinese people elect those who represent their will to hold and exercise power. At the same time, they undertake extensive deliberations before major decisions are made.  In China, hearing people’s voices, acting on their needs, and pooling their ideas and strength have become a standard practice. More and more ideas and suggestions of the general public are flowing directly to decision-makers at all levels, and they are increasingly reflected in the major decisions of the Party and the government.  The Chinese people are the masters of the country and exercise their democratic rights accordingly, managing affairs of the state, the economy, culture, and society through various channels and in many forms.  Taking into consideration its own conditions, China has explored a coordinated system of oversight and established a well-defined, efficient supervisory network with clear functions and responsibilities. Supervision of power extends across every area and into every corner.    Residents in Qianxibian village, Tangya township, Jindong district, Jinhua city, east China’s Zhejiang province, cast their ballots to elect officials for the villagers’ committee, Nov. 26, 2020. (People’s Daily Online/Yang Meiqing)  The wider the people’s democratic participation is, the better people’s aspirations can be expressed and the principle of the people running the country as its masters be realized.  Since the launch of the reform and opening-up in 1978, China has held 12 direct elections to people’s congresses at the township level and 11 direct elections to those at the county level, with a current participation rate of about 90 percent.  Among the enterprises in China that have established trade unions, a total of 3.14 million have established employees congresses.  Before adopting the Civil Code, the country solicited public opinions on the draft of it for 10 times and received more than one million pieces of suggestions and comments.  Today, as China constantly improves its democratic system, diversifies the forms of democracy, and expands democratic channels, the principle of the people being masters of the country is manifested in the Party’s governance policies and measures, in all aspects of the work of the Party and state organs at all levels, and in the efforts to meet the people’s expectation for a better life in a concrete and realistic way.

The suspect is an 18-year-old white man heavily armed with tactical gear and a helmet, said Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia in a press briefing late Saturday.  The gunman wore military-style clothing and body armor while carrying a rifle, according to reports.  He had a camera and the shooting was live streamed, according to Gramaglia.  The mass shooting is being investigated as a hate crime, said Stephen Belongia, the special agent in charge of the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Gramaglia said 11 victims are black while the other two are white.  The suspect drove to the supermarket around 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) and shot four people in the parking lot, said Gramaglia.  "The shooter was not from this community. In fact, the shooter traveled hours from outside this community to perpetrate this crime on the people of Buffalo," said Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown.  After shooting innocents inside the supermarket, the gunman once put the gun to his own neck but was persuaded by patrol officers to drop his gun, according to Gramaglia.  The gunman has been taken into custody and transported to Buffalo Police Headquarters.  The suspect will be arraigned on charge of murder in first degree Saturday evening, according to a district attorney.  Named Tops Friendly Market, the supermarket is located in a black-dominated community, which is around two miles (3.2 km) northeast of downtown Buffalo.  New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who was born in Buffalo, said she is on the way to Buffalo to assist with the response to the shooting and a family unification site has been set up for family members of the shooting victims.  "We must do more to address the scourge of racism and anti-Semitism, and to pass commonsense gun safety measures to keep our communities safe," said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York State.  More than 28,000 people have died or been injured due to gun-related incidents in the United States this year, according to a database run by the nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive.

"These plans are an Israeli persistence to perpetuate visiting the Al-Aqsa as something imposed by force, to consolidate its temporal division to divide it spatially," the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that the Israeli government is responsible for the consequences should a conflict occur.  Earlier on Saturday, the Jewish "Temple Mount" groups called through social media platforms on their Jewish fans to enter Al-Aqsa Mosque collectively on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the "Second Jewish Passover."  The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called on the international community and the United States to intervene urgently and put pressure on the Israeli government to stop the settler groups' visits to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.  In April, during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover, the Al-Aqsa compound witnessed fierce confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian worshipers who protested against Jewish visits to their holy site.  Tension at the Al-Aqsa Mosque could spark a military confrontation between armed Palestinian factions and Israel, similar to the last offensive waged by Israel on the Gaza Strip in May 2021.  For Muslims worldwide, the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the old city of Jerusalem is their first shrine and third mosque. They call the holy place al-Haram al-Sharif, while Jews call it "The Temple Mount."  The Palestinians want the eastern part of Jerusalem, which was occupied by Israel together with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967, as the capital of their future state.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement on Saturday night that the nation mourns the victims of "a senseless, horrific shooting" and the DOJ "is investigating this matter as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism."  He vowed to conduct "a thorough and expeditious investigation into this shooting" and to seek "justice for these innocent victims."  Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, are working with Buffalo Police Department and other partners, according to Garland's statement.  At least 10 people were killed by a gunman in a supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday afternoon. Three others were wounded but are expected to survive.  The gunman, who's in custody, wore military-style clothing and body armor and opened fire with a rifle. The attack was live-streamed on a gaming platform.  Out of the 13 victims, 11 are African Americans while two are white, according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia.  U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has been briefed on the shooting, according to an official tweet from the department.  "DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) is actively coordinating with all relevant local, state, and federal agencies and will continue to provide the Department's full support," the tweet read.  The White House has also reacted to the incident, calling it a "horrific shooting."  U.S. President Joe Biden "will continue to receive updates throughout the evening and tomorrow as further information develops," according to a statement from White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.  "The President and the First Lady are praying for those who have been lost and for their loved ones," Jean-Pierre added. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"Four years on, the trade war is still hurting U.S. consumers and companies, and forcing supply chain workarounds that make trade more complex and vulnerable," Christopher Tang, professor of supply chain management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, said in a recent article published on the South China Morning Post.  Like the professor, many more U.S. trade groups and economists have been urging the Biden administration to scrap Trump-era additional tariffs on Chinese imports, regarding such tariffs as counterproductive to the U.S. economy.  At a time when world economic recovery is still strangled by the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. economy itself faces soaring inflation, it will be both a right and responsible choice for the country to remove all additional tariffs as soon as possible, analysts said.  WHO PAYS THE PRICE  Four years after the U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese goods, it has been a clear fact that the acts have brought more costs to U.S. companies, consumers and farmers.  "American businesses and consumers, not Chinese exporters, are bearing the cost of Trump-era tariffs in the form of higher prices on made-in-China parts and products," David J. Bulman, assistant professor of China Studies and International Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said in an article published on The Hill earlier this year.  Tariffs on Chinese goods have provoked retaliatory tariffs that have sharply reduced American exports to China, allowing other nations to move in on markets once dominated by the U.S., he noted.  Since the additional tariffs were taken into effect, they have cost American companies 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars, and American household 1,300 U.S. dollars a year, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Qin Gang said during a recent interview with Forbes magazine, noting that the tariffs have not reduced the U.S. trade deficit.  Americans for Free Trade, a broad coalition of trade organizations, recently warned that the Section 301 tariffs create an "additional economic burden" for American businesses, manufacturers, farmers, and families, make the United States less competitive globally and cause "disproportionate economic harm to an American economy grappling with ongoing inflation concerns."  SOARING INFLATION PRESSURE  As the U.S. is experiencing the highest inflation in four decades, economists said eliminating additional tariffs on Chinese goods would help lower elevated inflation and stabilize inflation expectations.  "The reasons to end the trade war with China keep piling up. Inflation is the latest case in point," David J. Bulman said.  Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed Wednesday that U.S. consumer inflation in April surged by 8.3 percent from a year ago, marking the second straight month of inflation over 8 percent.  Even Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Television that removing Trump-era China tariffs would have some "desirable" effects on inflation and "it's worth considering."  "Americans are unhappy about rising inflation and costs, so providing tariff relief soon is one way to lower prices and increase demand, especially for consumer goods," said the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC), which represents 260 American companies that do business with China.  BACK ON TRACK  As people from the American academic and industrial circles came to urge the government to drop additional tariffs on Chinese products, it is significant to recognize the essence of China-U.S. business ties and bring it back on track.  The economic and trade relations between the world's two largest economies are mutually beneficial in nature and have been yielding win-win results.  Taking employment for instance, U.S. exports of goods and services to China support hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country in almost every sector of the economy, according to the U.S. Export Report 2022 released by USCBC.  "More than 300 congressional districts have over 1,000 jobs supported by exports to China, and eight are home to more than 10,000," the report said, noting that China remains an important market for U.S. exporters.  In 2020 alone, the number of jobs supported by exports to China reached a total of 858,486, according to the USCBC's calculations.  In addition to creating jobs, trade with China has helped increase the income of U.S. farmers as agricultural trade has been an important part of bilateral business activities.  U.S. goods exports to China reached an all-time high in 2021, with oilseeds and grains seeing significant growth to cement their place as the top U.S. export to China, the USCBC report said.  Last year, U.S. farmers sent 4.8 billion dollars more in oilseeds and crops such as soybeans, wheat, and corn, to China than they did the year before, bringing the latest total to 21.9 billion dollars.  "As we face a complex and severe situation in agricultural development and food security worldwide, I firmly believe that China and the United States, as major agricultural producers, consumers and traders, should meet challenges together, maintain stable development of agriculture, enhance the resilience of agricultural supply chains, ensure food security domestically, and promote cooperation for international food security," Qin said.  Despite the lingering COVID-19 disruptions, trade between China and the U.S. maintained sound momentum, rising 8.7 percent year on year to 1.56 trillion U.S. dollars in the first fourth months, demonstrating the high complementarity of the two economies.  In the context of soaring prices, the removal of additional tariffs on Chinese goods meets the fundamental interests of American consumers and businesses, and is beneficial to the U.S., China and the whole world, China's commerce ministry spokesperson Shu Jueting said Thursday at a press briefing.

In the call initiated by Helsinki, Niinisto informed Putin of Finland's decision to seek NATO membership in the next few days, according to a press release by the president's office of Finland.  Meanwhile, the Kremlin said in a statement that "Putin stressed that abandoning the traditional policy of military neutrality would be a mistake, since there are no threats to Finland's security."  Putin expressed concern that should Helsinki follow through with plans to join NATO, it may have a negative impact on Russia-Finland relations, the statement said.  When discussing the situation in Ukraine, Putin said peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives "were actually suspended by Kiev that does not show interest in a serious and constructive dialogue."

One day, almost 20 years ago, the father of five was working in the forest close to his home when he found four cluster bombs, unexploded remnants of the U.S. carpet bombing that devastated the area in the 1960s.  A USELESS PERSON  "I didn't want my children to play with the bombs, so I collected them, and as I did, one exploded. It blew off both my arms, and left me totally blind," Sam En told Xinhua on Friday. "I was 43 years old. I'm almost 61 now, but time has not healed me."  Sam En says he has been nothing but a burden to his family since the blast. He cannot do anything. He just sits at home all day. "The U.S. deprived me of everything. In a few seconds, I went from breadwinner to useless person."  The cluster bombs that claimed Sam En's eyes and arms are just a reminder of countless bombs that the U.S. dropped on Cambodia during the U.S.-Vietnam War, claiming countless other arms, legs and eyes, and thousands of lives. Between 1965 and 1973, the U.S. dropped 230,516 bombs in Cambodia. In April alone, at least five U.S. Mk 82 bombs, weighing about 500 pounds each, were found across the country. On May 5, a Cambodian bomb disposal team safely removed a U.S. bomb, weighing 2,000 pounds, from the Chaktomuk river opposite the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh.  "At that time, I saw U.S. warplanes flying around. They dropped bombs to cut off roads and bridges," Sam En said. "We lived in fear every day and ran to hide in trenches when we heard the warplanes."  Sam En said the U.S. has not provided any support to victims like him of its leftover bombs.  'VICIOUS, UNDECLARED WAR'  Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen wrote in his book "10 Years of Cambodia's Journey, 1979-1989" that the bombings killed "tens of thousands of civilians" in a "vicious, undeclared war"  Ly Thuch, first vice president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA), said Cambodia is still suffering from the huge legacy of the U.S.-Vietnam war and Cambodia's own internal conflicts. "There are a lot of bombs scattered on the ground, under the ground and in the water. We have not even conducted a large-scale search for underwater bombs, yet," he told Xinhua.  "Unexploded ordnance is a constant danger. Villages, farmland and rice fields still contain explosive remnants of war and the affected land cannot be farmed," he added.  Joseph Matthews of BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh said because of U.S. bombs many people have lost their lives or been maimed. According to the CMAA, from 1979 to March 2022, unexploded ordnance and landmines had killed 19,816 people and injured 45,175 others in Cambodia.  "I strongly believe that the U.S. is morally responsible for the suffering of these people and ethically and legally bound to adequately compensate the families of those who had lost their lives or were maimed by these unexploded ordnance and landmines," Matthews told Xinhua.  WOUNDS TO BE HEALED  Chhum Thea is 62 now. He lost his left arm to a mine in Kampong Cham province in 1990.  "U.S. planes bombed my village often during the war. The earth trembled as if it was an earthquake," he told Xinhua.  The bombs caused huge destruction. The U.S. must help Cambodia and compensate the innocent victims. I want the U.S. to heal the wounds that it created." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Kenya on Saturday began trial runs on the Chinese-built Nairobi expressway ahead of its commissioning in the next few weeks. (Photo by Fred Mutune/Xinhua)  NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya on Saturday began trial runs on the Chinese-built Nairobi expressway ahead of its commissioning in the next few weeks.  James Macharia, the cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development, said Saturday during a media briefing in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, that there is massive interest among motorists to use the toll road that stretches from the western side of the city to the southeast edge of the metropolis.  "It is one of the best pieces of infrastructure ever done in Africa. In fact, it's the longest expressway in Africa. And so, we are very proud today to come to witness the start of the trial run, which will be done for about three or four weeks," said Macharia, adding that 11,000 Kenyan road users have registered, and the number will go up to almost 50,000.  The 27.1-km Nairobi expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model. Full-scale construction of the about 600 million U.S. dollars infrastructure project began in September 2020.  Macharia said the expressway has been built in record time because it has been completed one year ahead of schedule, and its impact will be positive on the economy. He observed that the infrastructure project represents a new dawn for Kenya as it will have a very big impact in terms of mobility, especially for motorists traveling between Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Nairobi's central business district.  Macharia said the Nairobi expressway is a private investment and therefore the government has not committed any money to the infrastructure project.  "The Kenya government has not committed any money on this investment, we have not borrowed a single cent of the total amount of about 600 million U.S. dollars, which is about 70 billion shillings," he said.  "The money which the government could have spent here has been now spent elsewhere." According to Macharia, the Nairobi expressway is a good example of the benefits of public-private partnership because it frees up public expenditure for use on social expenditures.  "This is the most important thing for Kenyans to know that this public-private partnership is so important, because first of all, you don't borrow and it is not affecting our debt ratio," he added.  Ibrahim Doboshek, a motorist, who took part in the trial run, told Xinhua that the standards of the road construction of the expressway are comparable to those in the advanced countries of the world. "I am so grateful because I used to take 2 to 3 hours on Mombasa road due to traffic but today I have used 10 minutes."  George Were, another road user, who lives in Kitengela town which is about 30 km southeast of Nairobi's central business district, said that the new expressway is very convenient and fast. "I recommend guys to use it. I know there's the element of cost. But in terms of convenience, I think it is really value for money because a journey that used to take two hours is now down to less than 20 minutes."  Before Saturday's trial run, an inaugural city marathon was held on the Nairobi expressway last Sunday, which attracted more than 8,000 runners to participate.  "As a result of developing modern infrastructure projects like the Nairobi Expressway, the country will reap multiple benefits chief among them ease of travel, improved trade, investments and environmental health," Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said during the award ceremony for marathon winners.  During the construction period, the expressway had created more than 6,000 direct jobs, benefiting 200 sub-contractors and hundreds of other local suppliers of building materials such as steel, sand, cement and ballast.  A new job has now emerged in Kenya -- toll attendant on the expressway.  "I'm really excited about this job because it impacts positively on the country's development," Rodah Mwenje Okoth, who works as a toll attendant at the Nairobi expressway, told Xinhua that she underwent two months of intensive training before beginning her job.  She said the road project has provided a lot of job opportunities to Kenyans while solving traffic congestion in the capital city.  Like Okoth, more than 400 toll attendants are now working at the Nairobi Expressway. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

A total of 12 students demonstrated Chinese language and cultural skills at the first "Chinese Bridge" event held in person since the beginning of the COVID pandemic.  It was jointly organized by the Chinese embassy in Sofia and the Confucius Institute at "St. Cyril and St. Methodius" University of Veliko Turnovo (UVT).  Kristina Ivanova from Sofia's 138 High School for Western and Eastern Languages won the competition, and will represent the Balkan country at the finals in China.  While addressing the event, China's Ambassador to Bulgaria Dong Xiaojun said the Chinese Language Bridge has become an Olympics and a kind of cultural carnival for the Chinese language and people learning Chinese.  This was a useful experience for all participants, Dong said.  He also said that many colleges and universities in Bulgaria have opened Chinese language programs. They educated a large number of talents fluent in Chinese language and culture, providing a solid intellectual basis for exchange and cooperation between China and Bulgaria in various fields, the ambassador said.  Prof. Dimitar Dimitrov, Vice-rector of UVT, said that it was an "extraordinary event".  According to him, Chinese language and culture have been taught at this university for about 30 years, and the Confucius Institute at the UVT has existed for 10 years.  Thanks to the exceptional work of everyone related to the Chinese language and culture, it already had its roots throughout Bulgaria, Dimitrov said.  The "Chinese Bridge" competition was first organized in Bulgaria by the Confucius Institute in 2008 to inspire Bulgarian students between 15 to 20 years old to learn Chinese and enhance their understanding of the Chinese culture.

Earlier in the day, the Jewish Temple Mount groups called on Jews to visit the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Sunday to celebrate the annual Second Passover holiday, which this year coincides with the Nakba Day, or Day of the Catastrophe, marked by the Palestinians on May 15 every year, the day after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948.  "Allowing the so-called Temple Mount groups to storm the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Sunday when the Palestinians mark their 74th Nakba Day is a dangerous escalation and constitutes a provocation toward the feelings of our people," Hazem Qassem, Hamas spokesman in Gaza, told reporters.  This "would spark an open clash with the Israeli occupation forces ... and Israel would be fully responsible for the consequences," he said.  The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, is held as a holy site in both Islam and Judaism.  Qassem also called on Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Israel to gather at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Sunday to confront the "storming" plan by the Israeli settlers.  In April, when the Jewish Passover holiday coincided with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound witnessed fierce clashes between Palestinian worshippers and the Israeli police over the Jewish visit to the holy site.  The continuing high tensions at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound raise concerns about a possible military confrontation between armed Palestinian factions and Israel similar to the large-offensive offensive launched by Israel on the Gaza Strip in May 2021.  The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which was occupied by Israel together with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of their future independent state.

The gunman wore military-style clothing and body armor with a rifle and opened fire after entering the supermarket located at a neighborhood dominated by black people, according to a report by The Associated Press.  The shooter has been taken in custody, tweeted Buffalo Police Department.  U.S. President Joe Biden has been briefed on "the horrific shooting" in Buffalo, according to the White House.  Biden "will continue to receive updates throughout the evening and tomorrow as further information develops," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.  The gunman is a white man in late teens or early 20s wearing a black helmet, according to a report by the New York Post citing two witnesses of the carnage.  An investigation is under way to check if the gunman posted a manifesto online and the shooting was believed to be live-streamed, said the report, citing a local enforcement official.  Investigators are also working to know if the shooting was racially motivated, the report added.  Named Tops Friendly Market, the supermarket is located around 2 miles northeast of downtown Buffalo.  New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who was born in Buffalo, said she is on the way to Buffalo to assist with the response to the shooting.  More than 28,000 people have died or been injured due to gun-related incidents in the United States this year, according to a database run by the nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive.

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  The United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded U.S.-ASEAN summit will not draw regional countries closer to the U.S. side, and the U.S. attempt to court support among ASEAN in pursuit of its geopolitical interests is unlikely to gain traction, experts have said.  U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL  Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.  Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.  "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."  The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."  Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."  Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.  Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.  "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.  As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.  "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.  "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.  From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.  A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."  This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."

(Photo by Sovannara/Xinhua)  ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE  Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.  With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.  The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.  "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."  The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.  Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.  "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.  Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.  "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.  "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.  VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN  It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.  Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.  "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.  Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."  "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Once they join, it will leave only four of the EU's 27 member states Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta -- outside NATO.  ROME, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The likely ascension of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been sparked by fears in those countries of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. But analysts said the development could have consequences that go beyond the current crisis.  Finland and Sweden have been members of the European Union since 1993, but until now they have been among a small minority of EU member states not part of the NATO military alliance. Once they join, it will leave only four of the EU's 27 member states Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta -- outside NATO.  It also means that 24 of NATO's 32 members will be members of the European Union.  Analysts said that the two countries' membership in NATO will strengthen the alliance: both countries are among the world's richest nations, according to World Bank data, and military spending in both countries is broadly in line with NATO averages stated as a percentage of each country's gross domestic product.    Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde (6th L), Minister of Defense Peter Hultqvist (5th L) and other parliamentary party representatives present the result of a security analysis at a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 13, 2022. (Ninni Andersson/Government Offices of Sweden/Handout via Xinhua)  "What this means is that the ties between NATO and the European Union will become even closer," Elena Sciso, an international law professor at Rome's LUISS University, told Xinhua. "Consider that the European Union's Lisbon Treaty from 2009 includes a clause on mutual, collective defense, just as NATO does."  Nicolai von Ondarza, a political scientist and head of the European Union division at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs said Finland and Sweden were never "entirely neutral" when it came to security issues, noting their armed forces already coordinated activities with those from NATO countries and they shared intelligence. Instead, they practiced what he called "armed neutrality" -- meaning they are willing to use military force to maintain their neutrality if needed.  "One of the things this will mean is that the Baltic Sea will now become largely a NATO Sea," von Ondarza said in an interview, referring to the body of water in northern Europe surrounded by Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany -- all NATO member states -- in addition to Finland, Sweden, and Russia.  "I also think we will see a policy shift when it comes to foreign and military policy that will shift from crisis management to territorial defense," he said.  According to LUISS University's Sciso, there could be impacts of the move far beyond Europe. She noted that the Arctic Sea -- a nearly unpopulated region without major land mass thought to contain 160 billion barrels of oil and as much as 30 percent of the planet's natural gas is currently administered by eight countries that border it, five of which are members of NATO: Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United States. Once Finland and Sweden join NATO, that number will be seven of eight, with only Russia outside the alliance.  "It's significant because the states that govern the area will be dominated by NATO," Sciso said. "The countries involved are obligated to respect rules agreed to for the region on things ranging from fishing rights to nuclear testing, but they remain sovereign states and two of them are the world's largest nuclear powers."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

U.S. President Joe Biden defended his response to the crisis Friday as Republicans and conservative media attacked his administration's actions.  "If we'd been better mind readers I guess we could have (reacted faster)," he told CNN at a press conference.  Across the country, mothers took to social media and drove up to 50 miles to look around amid baby food formula shortage, People, an American weekly magazine that specializes in celebrity news and human-interest stories, said Friday, calling the situation "very, very scary."  One mother also told the Denver Channel that "my entire family just goes and finds the formula when we they can."  "My sister picked me up some in Arvada yesterday, my dad up in Thornton the other day," Ashlee Lane, the mother of a 7-month-old, said of her family's efforts scouring the Denver area for baby formula.  Data released this week by Datasembly, which tracks baby formula stock at more than 11,000 stores, showed that 43 percent of the top-selling baby formula products were out of stock as of the week ending May 8, and in five states, more than half of the top-selling formula products were missing from stores.  At busy retail giant Target in Boulder, 50 km northwest of Denver, baby formula supplies were scarce and most store shelves were empty on Friday.  "Usually they tell us when more is coming in," a store inventory clerk told Xinhua, pointing to her hand-held computer. "But this says zero are coming in and zero are expected soon."  Nearby, at high-end grocer Whole Foods, the story was the same, even with non-traditional formula products that catered to mothers with money seeking organic baby food solutions.  "We really noticed it in the past week," customer service representative Julian Bell said, "although our stock has been dwindling for several weeks."  On Friday, the Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS) website posted that "manufacturers have ramped up production 30-50 percent," and that "yesterday, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including Walmart, Target, Reckitt, and Gerber, to discuss ways to get more formula quickly and safely onto store shelves."  HHS pointed to the January recall of "certain powdered infant formulas" by industry leader Abbott Nutrition as a catalyst for the shortages, a federal response to four Michigan babies getting sick from the formula and two infant deaths between September and February.  "The reason we're here is because the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) took the steps to ensure that babies were taking safe formula," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a press conference Thursday.  "There were babies who died from taking this formula, so they were doing their jobs," Psaki said.  Psaki announced a series of measures to alleviate the shortage, including efforts to speed up production and crack down on price gouging, as reports surfaced of individuals buying out store supplies and re-selling them on Ebay for huge profits.  The Justice Department is now working with state attorney generals to monitor price-gouging in the formula market, and Biden said Thursday he had asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate reports of price-gouging.  The Biden administration is also working to increase imports of formula, a new solution as the United States produces 98 percent of its formula supply, according to an administration fact sheet.  On Friday, Biden also called for cutting red tape on the types of formula parents can buy, calling on the FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging and unfair market practices, and increase the supply of formula through increased imports.  Congressional Democrats joined the president in demanding answers from baby formula manufacturers.  In letters to the heads of four baby formula companies, Democratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney of New York and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois demanded documents and details about the shortage.  "The national formula shortage poses a threat to the health and economic security of infants and families in communities throughout the country -- particularly those with less income who have historically experienced health inequities, including food insecurity," they wrote in letters sent to Mead Johnson Nutrition, Nestle USA, Perrigo Company and Abbott Nutrition.  These companies control nearly 90 percent of the U.S. market for baby formula, the lawmakers said, requesting certain documents submitted by June 2.  REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT THE CRISIS  Republican leaders were quick to exploit the baby food crisis for their own political gain, slamming Biden on several fronts.  "This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE in America," Elise Stefanik, a New York House Republican, wrote on Twitter. "Sadly, this has become the norm because of Joe Biden's radical agenda."  "Unsurprisingly, when I reached out in February from my office to the FDA we received no substantive response. Joe Biden simply has no plan," Stefanik told the media at a press conference Thursday.  "Instead, bare shelves. Biden has continued to pass the buck. This is not a Third World country. This should never happen in the United States of America. We're unified in demanding action to address this crisis," she added.  Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, joined in: "This is sadly Joe Biden's America."

The viral disease, which gets its name "tomato fever" because of the red blister it causes, has raised concern in Kerala and the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.  Doctors say tomato flu comes with red rashes, skin irritation, and dehydration.  The illness that experts say is contagious can also cause tiredness, joint pain, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, high fever, or body ache. In some cases, it may also change the skin color of legs and hands, according to reports.  In Kerala, the disease has been detected in children under five years of age.  Tamil Nadu's Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan on Friday urged the local residents not to panic as health authorities were monitoring the situation across the state.  The Karnataka state government has sounded high alert in the districts bordering Kerala.  Health officials in these districts have been directed to step up surveillance measures and maintain a constant vigilance on outpatient services at both private and public health institutions.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The assistance was provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), according to the statement.  It added that more humanitarian assistance would be provided to needy families in Afghanistan's far-flung provinces in the coming days or weeks.  Following the U.S. forces' pullout from Afghanistan last August, Washington has imposed sanctions on the Taliban-run administration and frozen assets of more than 9 billion U.S. dollars of Afghanistan's central bank in a move weighing heavily on the battered economy in the war-torn Asian country.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Following an apparently random yet violent murder of a young Korean-American woman in a Chinatown apartment here in February, mourners placed flowers, candles, photos, and cardboard signs condemning anti-Asian hatred around a tree outside the residential building where Christina Yuna Lee was stabbed to death.  While the shock of Lee's death had yet to wear off, mourners were outraged that the makeshift memorial for Lee had been repeatedly vandalized.  The temporary memorial was first vandalized in the middle of the night just three days after Lee's death, and it continued to be vandalized even in broad daylight.  "So five times last month, and it just keeps increasing. It is very sad," Brian Chin, Lee's former landlord, told Xinhua.  According to video clips from a surveillance camera shared by Chin, a man kicked at the flowers, candles, and signs in the early morning on March 2, and another pedestrian pulled down a cardboard sign about a week later.  Every attack on the memorial is pretty much anti-Asian and "it is very scary right now," said Chin, whose family came to the United States from China over 60 years ago.  "They're doing it with hate. They see her picture. They see the flowers and candles," Chin added.  Lee's tragic death followed the fatal shoving of Asian American Michelle Alyssa Go onto subway tracks by a man at Times Square station on Jan. 15 and the death of Yaopan Ma in January in a racially motivated attack in East Harlem.  "Her (Lee's) death is part of an alarming pattern of unchecked, hateful violence against women, namely women of Asian descent and women of color that can no longer stand without consequence," said one of Lee's relatives in an appeal on Gofundme.com.  For Chin, a middle-aged man, the continued anti-Asian hate crimes had brought about unprecedented depression.  "I think everyone is terrified right now that they will be attacked on the subways, on the streets, and then the guy will be out on the same day," he said.  According to Chin, this wave of anti-Asian hatred began with very vitriolic language which claims COVID-19 as the so-called "Chinese flu" or "Wuhan flu."  Kathleen Flynn-hui, whose husband originally came from Hong Kong, said that anti-Asian prejudice affects her family on a daily basis.  "We've kind of always felt it, but not as strongly as now," said Flynn-hui, adding that she "dealt with discrimination against my husband because he was Asian the whole time."  Chin said the situation is deteriorating due to a combination of politics, the impact of new laws, and the new Manhattan District Attorney's lenient stance on crime.  "The cops are doing their job, but they arrest them, and they're free the next day due to the laws," said Chin.  Right now, much stronger laws are needed to protect the Asian community, Chin said, calling on lawmakers, the city council, and the mayor to take stronger and more enforceable action.  The Committee of 100, a non-profit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans, recently called on U.S. elected officials, law enforcement, and responsible media to address racism, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders immediately with actionable and concrete results.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

According to the latest edition of Newspoll published on Friday night, the Labor Party holds a comfortable 54-46 lead over the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis.  It marks the 20th consecutive Newspoll where the Coalition has trailed the Labor since November 2020.  Significantly, the Coalition has not been able to make any inroads since Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the election on April 10.  Newspoll found that 43 percent of voters identified Morrison as their preferred prime minister and 42 percent as Labor leader Anthony Albanese.  It represents a major swing in Albanese's favor from a 46-37 lead for Morrison at the end of April.  In a major shift of tone, Morrison promised to change his leadership style if re-elected.  Admitting he can be "a bit of a bulldozer", Morrison promised to empathize more with Australians if given another term as the prime minister.  "I will seek to explain motives and my concerns and empathize a lot more. But I tell you what, at the end of the day, what matters most is I get the job done," he told reporters.  In response, Albanese, who on Saturday announced a Labor government would boost health spending by 970 million Australian dollars (673 million U.S. dollars), promised to unite the country.  "A bulldozer wrecks things. A bulldozer knocks things over. I'm a builder, that's what I am," he said. "I will build things in this country."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.  U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL  Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.  Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.  "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."  The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."  Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."  Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.  Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.  "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.  As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.  "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.  "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.  From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.  A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."  This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."  ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE  Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.  With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.  The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.  "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."  The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.  Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.  "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.  Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.  "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.  "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.  VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN  It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.  Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.  "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.  Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."  "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"To influence domestic policies in recipient countries ... the U.S. has provided assistance to serve its goals and achieve its interests," Ayman Okeil, general manager of the Cairo-based Maat for Peace, Development, and Human Rights, told Xinhua in a recent interview.  THE NED AS A PROXY  Among all the proxies Washington uses to serve its political agenda in other countries, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was founded in 1983 as a bipartisan, non-profit institution by the U.S. government, is one of the most active.  Nominally a non-governmental organization that provides support for democracy abroad, the NED in fact relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the U.S. Congress, and takes orders from the U.S. government.  Okeil described the NED as one of Washington's "soldiers" for interfering in other countries' decision-making process.  The NED has worked as a substitute for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cultivating pro-U.S. opposition activists for subverting lawful governments and provoking uprisings in the Arab countries under the pretext of promoting democracy, he said.  According to Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, the NED was founded as a tool for projecting political influence in different sovereign states that the U.S. government has labeled as "non-democratic, totalitarian, authoritarian and anti-American."  The NED supported opposition groups in other countries, which were trained to represent Washington's interest, rather than the vital interests of their own nations and states, Rawashdeh pointed out.  Echoing Rawashdeh's point, Okeil said that the NED has spent millions of U.S. dollars to support political parties, labor unions, dissident movements, and media in dozens of countries.  The organization has been employed as the "mastermind" behind separatist riots, color revolutions, and political crises around the world, with the aim of toppling legitimate governments and creating U.S. puppets in targeted countries, said Ahmad Ashqar, a Syrian journalist and political expert.  The NED makes sure that nations across the globe do what the United States wants them to do and in no way feel confident and capable of pursuing their own political/ideological agendas, Rawashdeh said. "And this is also what the U.S. foreign policy is doing for decades."  A NEW TYPE OF IMPERIALISM  The United States, unfortunately, has created a new type of imperialism, by occupying foreign countries with money and forces and interfering in their choice of leaders and party compositions, Okeil told Xinhua.  Unlike the funds that came from some countries like China, which help improve health, education and development sectors, the U.S. economic aid is always with conditions attached, he noted  Okeil's words are not groundless. According to a study by the American University in Cairo in November 2021, the NED has allocated more than 606 million dollars in "democracy assistance" to Egypt in the period between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the U.S. government provided 415 million dollars in economic assistance to Egypt, which includes 55 million dollars to support programs for promoting democracy.  However, as Tariq Fahmy, a political science professor at the Cairo University, noted, the U.S. mode of democracy has not been successful in the Middle East, and it contradicts many countries' unique conditions.  "We all saw the disgraceful role in provoking the Arab Spring via funding the protesters" under the cover of democracy and human rights, Fahmy said, explaining that such kind of imposed democracy couldn't breed stability.  After the Arab Spring, many people in the Middle East have started to see the real objectives behind the U.S. aid when knowing that Washington had a role in inciting the Arab Spring uprisings via supporting, training and funding young protesters, Okeil noted.  The U.S. model of democracy is not suitable for the world, and based on that model, the U.S. policies led to real crimes, Fahmy said.  It's a fact that the United States has distorted the positive meaning of democracy and emptied such a notion of anything useful and beneficial for other countries, Ashqar argued.  "We have seen several examples like in Syria, where the United States used democracy as a pretext to support separatist forces and radical ones to destabilize the legitimate government," he said. "The U.S. presence in Syria has achieved all but the so-called democracy."  "Under the pretext of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy, the U.S. has stolen key areas in Syria rich with oil and gas, do you call that democracy?" asked the Syrian journalist.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The fire broke out inside the building on Friday evening at 4:40 p.m. (local time) near the city's Mundka metro station, and the death toll became clear only by night.  Reports said the fire started from the first floor of the building at an office of a CCTV cameras and router manufacturing company.  Officials said the firefighting and rescue operations continued until early morning on Saturday. Police are yet to identify the deceased, and the injured have been admitted to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital.  Firefighters used heavy cranes to reach the top floor of the building, and 27 fire tenders were sent to contain the blaze when smoke surrounded the entire building.  Video clips showed people trying to escape the building using a rope and hanging from broken windows. Many people could be seen trying to jump to another building.  "There was only one staircase and because of that people could not go out. I think the building did not have a proper no objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department," Satpal Bhardwaj, divisional officer of the Delhi fire department told media.  Police said they have arrested the owners of the company, but the owner of the building who did not have safety clearance from the fire department is on the run.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed grief over the deaths in the fire.  "Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a tragic fire in Delhi. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery," Modi wrote on social media.  Chances of fire in Indian buildings are usually high as people often ignore safety standards vis-a-vis fire.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Guterres extended his condolences to the royal family and the government and people of the UAE, said Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the secretary-general, in a statement.

Several missiles fired by Israel hit targets near the Masyaf area of Hama province, SANA reported, citing a military statement.  The attack also caused property damage and set fire to the forest of Masyaf, according to the report.  In an earlier report, SANA said that Syria has intercepted Israeli missiles in its central coast region.  Explosions were heard in the Syrian coast cities of Banyas, Tartous, and Jableh, according to the report, adding most of the missiles were intercepted before reaching their targets.  Israel frequently bombed Syria's military facilities while claiming it was striking pro-Iran militia bases.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The fire broke out at around 4:40 p.m. local time in the building located near the Mundka metro station in outer Delhi.  "A total of 16 bodies were recovered from the three-storey commercial building which had caught fire this evening near Delhi's Mundka metro station," Atul Garg, director of the Delhi fire service, told local media.  According to Garg, the third floor of the building was yet to be searched.  Police officials said the death toll was likely to rise as many people were feared trapped in the building.  "Rescue operation is underway in the building," a police official said.  Officials said 24 fire tenders were at the spot to contain the blaze.  "It's a massive fire and heavy cranes are being used to go up and douse the fire," a fire service official said.  The cause of the fire is not immediately known. However, reports said the fire started from the first floor of the building which hosts an office of a CCTV camera and router manufacturing company.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  *The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements.   *The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House is peddling its so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" against China and ramping up its pressure campaign of the Russia-Ukraine conflict during a two-day summit in Washington with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  But its hope to pull ASEAN members into its camp will shrivel, as ASEAN countries have already woken up to Washington's typical hegemony, hypocrisy and egomania.  The arrangement of the summit itself has laid bare Washington's double-dealing nature. Its disrespect for ASEAN members concerning scheduling issues despite its pledge of "enduring commitment" has sparked a wave of complaints among ASEAN members, resulting in a postponement of the summit from late March to May.  Cambodian Minister attached to the Prime Minister Kao Kim Hourn said before the summit that if Washington was serious about improving its ties with ASEAN, it should have arranged bilateral meetings between the United States and ASEAN countries. ASEAN leaders "should be treated with respect and equality," he noted.  The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements. The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  Many sober minds in ASEAN have seen through this duplicity and bullying. Indonesia and Malaysia warned that AUKUS could lead to a major arms race in the region. A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."

(Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)  Meanwhile, the White House will attempt in vain during this summit to talk ASEAN into imposing sanctions against Russia. Ever since the escalation of the current Ukraine crisis, Washington has been trying to exert pressure on ASEAN to take sides, but most of ASEAN members did not follow suit.  On April 7, six of the 10-member bloc abstained from voting in favor of a resolution to remove Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and two voted against it. Long adhering to an independent foreign policy, ASEAN members have urged solving the crisis through negotiation and dialogue.  Moreover, some ASEAN members have been well aware of Washington's unspoken calculations to turn bloody sufferings of others into golden opportunities for profits in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during his visit to China in early April, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said he appreciates China's objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, that "Asian countries should maintain peace and stability in the region, jointly resist unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law, and prevent attempts to create tensions and replicate crises in the region."  Playing small clique politics and forcing others to take sides -- Washington's old tricks to gain geopolitical interests -- work against ASEAN's will to uphold regional peace and stability and to realize sustainable economic development. Launching trade wars and breaking pacts -- Washington's classical acts of unilateralism -- severely disrupt normal trade exchanges and supply chains in the region and deal a heavy blow to ASEAN's economy. All those wrongdoings have tarnished Washington's credit and influence as the world's sole superpower, and driven it further apart from ASEAN members.  The long arc of history teaches each and every country that acting without scruples almost always results in the reverse of what one desires. It is time for Washington to learn this lesson, abandon its old dream of Cold War hegemony, uphold an open and inclusive mindset, and play its due role in maintaining regional and global peace, stability and development.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

A security analysis presented by the Swedish parliament on Friday that says a NATO membership would increase security for the Nordic country was questioned by several parties ahead of Sweden's historic decision on whether to be a new member of the trans-Atlantic military bloc. (Ninni Andersson/Government Offices of Sweden/Handout via Xinhua)  STOCKHOLM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A security analysis presented by the Swedish parliament on Friday that says a NATO membership would increase security for the Nordic country was questioned by several parties ahead of Sweden's historic decision on whether to be a new member of the trans-Atlantic military bloc.  The security analysis, which serves as an important basis for Sweden's upcoming NATO membership decisions, has been prepared by all eight parliamentary parties, of which, the Left Party and the Green Party, however, do not support the report's conclusions as a whole.  Although the analysis listed a number of advantages of possible Swedish membership in NATO, with an "increased security" as the main conclusion, it does not provide a recommendation on whether Sweden should join.  However, the analysis is widely understood to serve as an important basis for the ruling Social Democrats' and the government's NATO decision, to be presented on Sunday and Monday respectively.  "The main conclusion of a possible membership in NATO is that Sweden would become part of NATO's collective security," said Foreign Minister Ann Linde at a press conference on Friday.  While the analysis assesses that Sweden will not be exposed to a conventional military attack as a reaction to a possible Swedish NATO application, Linde said that "an armed attack on Sweden can not be ruled out."  "We see a democratic decline in several countries today, even among countries that are members of NATO, which is not clearly mentioned. The Green Party's basic attitude towards NATO has not changed." Maria Ferm, member of the Green Party, told Swedish Television, emphasizing her party's opposition to joining NATO.  "We have therefore submitted a special opinion about this issue and about this analysis, because we do not agree with all the wording about NATO this analysis contains," Ferm emphasized.  "I think there is no analysis of the risks that a Swedish NATO membership entails." Hakan Svenneling, a member of the Left Party told Swedish Television, "We are making the biggest change in Swedish security policy in a very long time. And freedom of alliance has been very important and served Sweden well for a long time, and could do so for a long time to come."  "I am worried that every major conflict for a long time to come, for decades, will take place at Sweden's borders or in Sweden. This is something I do not want to be a part of, which is why I oppose Swedish NATO membership," Svenneling said.&nbsp;    Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde (R) and Minister of Defense Peter Hultqvist attend a press conference on a security analysis in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 13, 2022.

Analysts believe that U.S. attempts to court support among ASEAN leaders in pursuit of its geopolitical interests are unlikely to gain traction.  ASEAN leaders are more likely to emphasize their economic interests, analysts have said, adding the bloc members, who are seeking a post-pandemic economic recovery, will put ASEAN centrality at the forefront while deflecting any attempt to draw them into a U.S. sphere of influence.  The summit officially commemorates 45 years of U.S.-ASEAN ties. It was initially scheduled for late March but was postponed due to scheduling issues.  Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research, said Wednesday that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) last month.  "I think President Biden must be wondering why ASEAN nation did not outright condemn Russia and did not support it wholeheartedly. This can especially be seen during the resolution to remove Russia from the UNHRC on April 7: Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and Brunei abstained while Vietnam and Laos voted against it," Hassan told Xinhua in a phone interview.  He also said that the United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain.  "Overall, despite the ideas of geopolitical maneuvering, I think the most important issue that will be discussed among the participants will be the economic side, how to spur the trade between ASEAN and the U.S. post-pandemic. I think that will be the most important subject matter from ASEAN point of view," he said.  Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said that while the summit is happening against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.  "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea. Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries," she said.  "ASEAN members can already anticipate that the summit is ideal for the Biden administration to stress the common interests and shared values between the U.S. and the ASEAN countries. The U.S. is expected to leverage these ideas to draw ASEAN closer to them," she added.  Lee cautioned that unless it can demonstrate unity, the ASEAN bloc may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness. This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States.  "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," Lee said. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Russia has repeatedly noted that while it is up to Finland to decide which measures it will take to ensure its national security, it must also be aware of the consequences of its actions, the ministry said.  "Finland's accession to NATO will seriously damage Russian-Finnish relations as well as stability and security in Northern Europe," it added.  - - - -  On Thursday, the Ukrainian parliament approved a presidential decree on seizing the assets of Russia's state-run Sberbank and the state development corporation VEB.RF, Unian news agency reported, citing lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak.  The presidential proposal on the seizure of the assets of Russian financial institutions was supported by 334 lawmakers in the 450-seat assembly, Zheleznyak said.  - - - -  By waging a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, Western countries ultimately risk turning the current conflict into a full-fledged nuclear war, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said Thursday.  NATO countries increase the risk of a direct and open conflict with Russia by pumping weapons into Ukraine, training Ukrainian troops using Western equipment, dispatching mercenaries and conducting exercises near Russia's borders, Medvedev wrote on his Telegram.  - - - -  Russian forces carried out a rocket attack on a major oil refinery in Kremenchuk town in Ukraine's central Poltava region on Thursday, said the head of Poltava regional military-civilian administration Dmytro Lunin.  "Today's shelling of the Poltava region is perhaps the largest during the full-scale war," Lunin wrote on Telegram.  Twelve rockets hit the infrastructure facilities in Kremenchuk, with most of them striking the oil refinery, Lunin said.  The attack caused a fire at the oil refinery, Lunin said, adding there were no casualties in the shelling.  - - - -  Ukraine is negotiating with Russia over the evacuation of seriously injured soldiers from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Thursday.  Ukraine seeks to exchange 38 severely injured soldiers from Azovstal for the captured Russian military, Vereshchuk wrote on Telegram.  Currently, there are no talks on exchanging several hundred people, as reported by some media outlets, Vereshchuk said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Republicans and Democrats differ over what they see as major national problems.  Inflation is the "top concern among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents," with 84 percent calling it a very big problem. A narrower majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (57 percent) view inflation the same way.  "Our goal, of course, is to get inflation back down to 2 percent without having the economy go into recession, or, to put it this way, with the labor market remaining fairly strong," U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, whose second term was confirmed by the Senate Thursday, said in an interview with Marketplace.  "I think it's a very challenging environment to make monetary policy," said Powell, noting that the central bank is "struggling" to restore price stability.  The Pew Research Center survey showed that other big problems include affordability of health care (55 percent), violent crime (54 percent), gun violence (51 percent) and the federal budget deficit (51 percent).  The survey noted that more than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, just 19 percent of Americans rate the coronavirus outbreak as a very big problem for the country, the lowest share out of 12 issues included in the survey. In June 2020, in the early stages of the outbreak, 58 percent rated it as a very big problem, placing it among the top concerns at the time.  The survey was conducted from April 25 to May 1 among 5,074 adults. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Managing director of the Australian Tourism Export Council (ATEC), Australia's peak tourism body, Peter Shelley said on Friday that a long period of uncertainty was beginning to come to an end.  Australia's export tourism industry has endured two years of debilitating conditions where many businesses simply had no income or vision on when it would end, Shelley said.  According to data released by Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Thursday, Australia's international visitors had reached their highest levels since February of 2020, when an estimated 647,000 international travelers arrived in Australia before its borders were shut in March.  In April this year, 575,530 visitors arrived in Australia, 200,000 more visitors than the previous month.  As a result, the pandemic has all but decimated Australia's 45 billion Australian dollars (about 31 billion U.S. dollars) export tourism industry, however, the ATEC said that government and industry would need to play an active role in its recovery.  "Now we have our borders open we are seeing the green shoots of recovery and with export tourism businesses looking to rebuild their markets, this (is) an important time for government focus on investing in getting the industry back on its feet," said Shelley.  The ATEC launched a tourism campaign dubbed "its time for tourism," which called for greater funding for peak tourism marketing body, Tourism Australia, and greater training for workers in the tourism industry.  "While we rebuild our industry we also have the opportunity to innovate and improve business practices, support a more sustainable industry and create a tourism industry of the future," said Shelley.

Kim examined the epidemic prevention situation "after the state epidemic prevention work was switched over to the maximum emergency epidemic prevention system," and learned about the nationwide spread of COVID-19, said the report.  A fever whose cause couldn't be identified explosively spread nationwide from late April, and more than 350,000 people got fever "in a short span of time" and at least 162,200 of them recovered completely.  On Thursday alone, some 18,000 persons with fever occurred nationwide. So far, up to 187,800 people are being isolated and treated, with six dead (one of them tested positive for the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron), it said.  "The simultaneous spread of fever with the capital area as a centre shows that there is a vulnerable point in the epidemic prevention system we have already established," Kim was quoted as saying.  "It is the most important challenge and supreme tasks facing our Party to reverse the immediate public health crisis situation at an early date, restore the stability of epidemic prevention and protect the health and wellbeing of our people," he said.  The official news agency reported Thursday that samples taken from patients with fever in Pyongyang on Sunday were "consistent with" the virus' highly transmissible Omicron variant.  The DPRK has taken strict measures to ward off the virus by closing its borders soon after the outbreak of the pandemic, and had not confirmed a single case until Thursday.

"It's just absolutely mind-boggling," he told Xinhua when describing his feeling of living through it. "It's surreal."  The once-in-a-century pandemic has unimaginably claimed 1 million lives out of more than 82 million infections in the United States over the past two years or so, and changed the nation -- and the rest of the world -- in ways big and small.  For Powers, an African American audio engineer who lives with his family in Arlington County, Virginia, on the East Coast, there has been no shortage of challenges because most of his assignments need to be worked on in studios -- forcing him to travel between home and workplace, which expose him to greater risks of catching the virus.  To protect himself and also those around him, Powers masks up wherever he goes, although most Americans are no longer required to cover their faces indoors in public areas.  Besides, in the first year of the pandemic, Powers wore gloves every single day at work when touching his equipment. He and his wife also chose to go to the pharmacy or grocery store late at night or very early in the morning to avoid contact with the crowd as much as possible.  "I'm not catching COVID though it's still out there," Powers said of his precaution. "I don't really have any physical ailments ... I have loved ones who have it. So it's a situation where I want to be as safe as possible, and I'll keep my family safe."  Powers, who has been fully vaccinated and received a booster shot, said the fact that there has been an obvious hesitancy among the African American community toward the vaccines is partly due to Washington's notorious record of using them to conduct medical experiments.  Powers particularly referred to the infamous "Tuskegee Experiment" that began in 1932, in which hundreds of African Americans were recruited by doctors from the U.S. Public Health Service for a study to track the full progression of syphilis without effective care. In 1997, the White House issued a formal presidential apology for the study which was terminated in the 1970s. "They basically used people as Guinea pigs," Powers deplored. "There's a lot of distrust."  Though Powers said he believes most African Americans "have gotten beyond that" and tried to be vaccinated in this pandemic, he would still feel "relatively safe" if he could see "a whole bunch of different people from different races and cultures" in the line for a vaccination.  The vaccine hesitancy, along with an unequal distribution of healthcare and other resources, has contributed to the pandemic's disproportionate impact on African Americans who are more likely to suffer from preexisting medical conditions like obesity and diabetes, and who work as "essential workers" but are less likely to be insured than white people in the nation.  In Washington, D.C., located just across the Potomac River from Arlington County, African Americans account for roughly half of the population, but nearly four in five COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. capital. In the first few months of the U.S. vaccine rollout, African Americans received shots at a much lower rate than their white peers.  "Well, racial inequality was baked into the recipe of the creation of the United States of America," Rashawn Ray, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, wrote in an analysis published in April 2020.  "Inequities in neighborhood resources and the healthcare system are manifestations of this recipe," warned Ray, also an African American. "And, when crises like the COVID-19 pandemic occur, inequalities are exacerbated rather than diminished."  The disparities are even more pronounced in some suburban areas of the country. Bree Hartfield, born and reared in Beaumont, Mississippi, told Xinhua that there is only "a nurse practitioner but no doctor on staff" in the small town where she has seen "a lot of deaths, a lot of tragedies" throughout the pandemic.  "African Americans do succumb to illnesses in a different way because of the lack of resources, the lack of opportunities to get the resources," Hartfield noted, attributing the phenomenon to "inequitable resources" and a lack of good leadership. "So equitable resources are what we would need to implement, especially into the small towns where I think money doesn't reach," she said.  The pandemic has already taken a backseat in the United States to soaring inflation and the Ukraine crisis, as states and cities have lifted anti-pandemic restrictions. But Powers continues to see it as an issue "in the forefront" for him and "a tough situation," because "there are still people who are testing positive."  U.S. President Joe Biden ordered flags at half-staff on Thursday to commemorate the deaths of 1 million Americans who lost their lives to COVID-19.  "Today, we mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to COVID-19," Biden said in a statement. "One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed because of this pandemic."  COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are on the rise in the United States, with new related deaths projected to resurge in coming weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "We are still in the middle of a pandemic, to be sure -- there's no confusion about that," top U.S. infectious disease expert and White House chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci has recently said.  "COVID didn't have to kill most who died from it," former U.S. CDC Director and epidemiologist Tom Frieden tweeted on Thursday. "At least half of U.S. COVID deaths in 2020 were preventable through better public health action, and more than half of 2021 deaths were preventable through improved vaccination. We can save lives by taking reasonable precautions."  Speaking of the nation's loss of more than 1 million lives to the pandemic, Hartfield said it is "an astronomical number" and that "it is terrible."  "I do wish all the blessings for those families," she added. "But I just think this is an opportunity to reflect on the things that we could do better as a country."

The JCS said in a statement that it detected the missiles, which were launched into the eastern waters from the Sunan area in Pyongyang at about 6:29 p.m. local time (0929 GMT).  The JCS noted that South Korea was maintaining a full readiness posture in close cooperation with the United States while strengthening surveillance and vigilance.  The DPRK testfire came five days after South Korea said the DPRK launched one short-range ballistic missile, presumed to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), off its east coast.  The DPRK has launched projectiles 16 times this year, saying it test-fired a new type intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), Hwasongpho-17, on March 24. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Resolution 2630, which won the unanimous support of the 15 members of the Security Council, also decides to extend the peacekeeping mission's mandate modification till Nov. 15, 2022.  The Security Council first modified the mandate of the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) in December 2011 to add tasks of supporting a Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism of Sudan and South Sudan, which gained independence from the former in July 2011.  Resolution 2630 decides that UNISFA should maintain the authorized troop ceiling at 3,250 and the authorized police ceiling at 640.  It urges the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to provide full support for UNISFA in the implementation of its mandate and deployment of UNISFA personnel. It reiterates that Abyei shall be demilitarized from any forces, as well as armed elements of the local communities, other than UNISFA and the Abyei Police Service.  UNISFA was set up by the Security Council in June 2011 after a flare-up shortly before South Sudan's independence. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Ukraine's inability to export its agricultural produce through Black Sea ports because of the blockade is threatening global food security and has prompted the development of an action plan to overcome this hurdle, the Commission said in a statement.  Under normal circumstances, Ukraine exports 75 percent of the grain it produces, generating around 20 percent of its annual export revenues. Before the conflict, Ukraine's Black Sea ports handled 90 percent of its grain and oilseed exports.  "Twenty million tonnes of grains have to leave Ukraine in less than three months using the EU infrastructure," Transport Commissioner Adina Valean said in a statement. "This is a gigantesque challenge, so it is essential to coordinate and optimize the logistic chains, put in place new routes and avoid, as much as possible, the bottlenecks."  The Commission said that in spite of immediate efforts by the EU and its member states to ease border crossings between Ukraine and the EU, thousands of wagons and lorries are waiting for clearance on the Ukrainian side. The average current waiting time for wagons is 16 days, while it is up to 30 days at some borders. More grain is still stored and held back in Ukrainian silos ready for export.  Among the challenges are differing rail gauge widths since the wagons used in Ukraine are not compatible with most of the EU rail network, so most goods need to be transhipped to lorries or wagons that fit the EU standard gauge.

The report, released by U.S. healthcare consultancy company Kaufman Hall on Wednesday, noted that a nationwide shortage of healthcare workers made worse by the pandemic, and hospital and health systems' increased reliance on contract labor, is driving expenses upward and contributing to steep declines in profit margins.  During the pandemic, almost one in five healthcare workers quit their jobs. One-third of nurses plan to leave their current roles by the end of 2022, with more than a quarter of those intending to become traveling nurses, according to the report, titled "The Financial Effects of Hospital Workforce Dislocation: A Special Workforce Edition of the National Hospital Flash Report."  Contract labor as a percentage of total labor expenses increased more than five times the rate from pre-pandemic levels, said the report.  Pre-pandemic, wage rates for contract nurses were almost double those for employed nurses. As the pandemic continued and labor shortages intensified, that wage gap increased significantly. As of March 2022, the median wage rate for contract nurses had risen to more than three times that of employed nurses, the report added. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the region has surpassed 218 million, and 2,003,081 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported.  "While this number is devastating, it represents a fraction of the overall deaths directly and indirectly associated with COVID-19, as the WHO's report on excess mortality during the pandemic has shown," the office said in a statement.  It noted that although the number of new infections is decreasing in the region, COVID-19 remains a lethal virus, particularly for unvaccinated and clinically vulnerable individuals.  WHO Europe urged the broad public to take immediate and long-term action on multiple fronts.  "These include protecting the most vulnerable, continuing to monitor the virus and its spread, keeping health systems ready for any developments of the pandemic, and tackling its long-term impacts," it said.

Latitude Residency &amp; Citizenship, a company which guides high-net-worth investors around the world through the application process, was quoted as saying that U.S. inquiries have increased 300 percent between 2019 and 2021.  Henley &amp; Partners, one of the world's largest citizenship brokers, said sales to American nationals increased by 327 percent between 2019 and 2020 and an additional 10 percent in 2021.  According to Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley &amp; Partners, there are "four C's" currently driving the investor citizenship industry: COVID-19, climate change, cryptocurrency, and conflict. The recent uptick in American applicants started during the Trump administration and escalated during pandemic lockdowns, he said.  "In the very strict lockdowns there was a point where if you only had an American passport, you could not enter Europe," said Volek. "I think that made a lot of particularly ultra high net worth individuals realize that they're potentially a little bit more fragile than they thought."  More than a dozen countries offer so-called "golden passports" and visas that allow affluent foreigners to receive citizenship or residency in exchange for investing in the country. The most expensive programs range from 1.1 million U.S. dollars in Malta to 9.5 million dollars in Austria, the Insider report said, citing Forbes. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)  BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- The year 2021 witnessed Chinese President Xi Jinping's tight schedule of "cloud diplomacy:" he had 79 telephone calls with leaders of foreign countries and international organizations, and attended 40 major diplomatic events via video link.  These activities have strengthened the bonds between China and the rest of the world and showed that the country, with a civilization of more than 5,000 years and a population of over 1.4 billion, is making continuous efforts to seek common development and a better future for mankind.  HIGHLIGHTS OF BILATERAL ACTIVITIES  In the face of complicated international situations, China-Russia ties have become a staunch force for world peace and stability.  From major cooperation projects to the official extension of the China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, and to the successful conclusion of the China-Russia Year of Scientific and Technological Innovation, cooperation between the two countries has yielded fruitful results last year.  As Xi put it in December, in his second virtual meeting in 2021 and 37th meeting since 2013 with Russian President Vladimir Putin, China and Russia have actively fulfilled their responsibilities as major countries, and acted as a pillar of strength in following true multilateralism and upholding fairness and justice in the world.    Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with U.S. President Joe Biden via video link, in Beijing, capital of China, Nov. 16, 2021. (Xinhua/Ding Lin)  About a month before this talk, Xi held a video call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden. The Chinese president pointed out that the most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the United States to find the right way to get along.  He also highlighted mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as three principles in developing China-U.S. relations in the new era.  In the month between the two meetings, Xi conducted a series of bilateral and multilateral activities, including congratulating Olaf Scholz on his election as German chancellor, addressing the opening ceremony of the China-Laos Railway via video link and sending congratulatory messages to the re-elected presidents of Vietnam and Uzbekistan.  QUOTES ON MULTILATERALISM  2021 marked the 20th anniversary of China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the 30th anniversary of China's joining the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations (UN).    Chinese President Xi Jinping addresses the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly via video on Sept. 21, 2021. (Xinhua/Wang Ying)  The Chinese president has expressed several times that China is determined to champion multilateralism. And new fruits of friendship are yielded thanks to candid exchanges and innovative cooperation mechanisms.  -- On the China-Central and Eastern European Countries summit in February, Xi said China intends to "import more than 170 billion U.S. dollars of goods from CEE countries" and will "work to double CEE countries' agricultural exports to China and raise two-way agricultural trade by 50 percent."  -- The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in China's Kunming in October, at which Xi announced China's initiative to establish a Kunming Biodiversity Fund and take the lead by investing 1.5 billion yuan (233 million U.S. dollars) to support biodiversity protection in developing countries.  -- While addressing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-China Special Summit to Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations via video link in November, Xi called for fostering a closer community with a shared future for China and ASEAN, while keeping in mind people's aspirations for a better life.  HARMONIOUS RELATION WITH NATURE  The world has come to a crossroads where humanity is confronting the challenges of the times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Xi has put forward a series of new ideas and initiatives, which shows that China is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, a defender of the international order and a provider of public goods.

(Chinese Embassy in CAR/Handout via Xinhua)  China would provide an additional 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Africa, Xi announced while addressing the opening ceremony of the 8th Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation via video link.  As the first country to propose the COVID-19 vaccine as a global public good and to advocate global vaccine cooperation, China provided over 2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and organizations throughout 2021.  Xi said "China will do its best to help developing countries cope with the COVID-19 pandemic," in a written message to the first meeting of the International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation in August.  In terms of climate issues, as "the first from the leader of a single country," quoting U.S. media CNBC, to speak on the Leaders' Summit on Climate in April, Xi reaffirmed that China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.  Throughout the year, China has not only pledged to achieve carbon neutrality, but also promoted the establishment of the Kunming Biodiversity Fund, issued the China-U.S. joint declaration on enhancing climate action, and participated in adopting the Glasgow Climate Pact.  In his keynote speech at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021, Xi called on countries to answer the "call of our times," defeat the pandemic through solidarity, strengthen global governance and keep pursuing a community with a shared future for mankind.  SEEKING DEVELOPMENT  Only when countries develop together can there be true development, and only when countries prosper together can there be true prosperity, Xi said, while addressing via video link the opening ceremony of the Second UN Global Sustainable Transport Conference.  The UN welcomes the China-proposed Global Development Initiative (GDI) as it will speed up implementing the 2030 Agenda, said Siddharth Chatterjee, UN development system resident coordinator in China.  The GDI proposed by Xi is an initiative to support the development of developing countries, promote global economic recovery in the post-pandemic era and strengthen international development cooperation.

On Dec. 3, the first train of the China-Laos Railway left Vientiane in the afternoon after the cross-border railway was officially put into operation.  The 1,035-km electrified passenger and cargo railway, connecting Kunming in southwest China's Yunnan Province with the Lao capital, Vientiane, has fully adopted Chinese technical standards and consists of two sections. The start of its construction dates back to December 2016.  Xi said the China-Laos Railway is a landmark project of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.  "China is willing to work with Laos and other countries along the route to speed up the building of a closer Belt and Road partnership and a community with a shared future for mankind," he said.  While some are seeking to stir confrontation or sow division, Xi has been proposing the promotion of humanity's common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom.  "With a strong sense of responsibility for the future of all mankind, we need to champion the common values of humanity, foster broad-minded tolerance toward the understanding of values by different civilizations, and respect the explorations of different peoples to turn values into reality," Xi said, addressing the Communist Party of China and World Political Parties Summit held in July 2021.  "By doing so, the common values of humanity will be translated into the practice of individual countries to serve the interests of their own people in a concrete and realistic way," he said.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Xi extended congratulations to the 70th anniversary of Tibet's peaceful liberation, visited officials and ordinary people of various ethnic groups and conveyed the CPC Central Committee's care to them.  Xi said over the past 70 years Tibet has made historic strides in the social system and realized full economic and social development, with people's living standards significantly improved.  "It has been proven that without the CPC, there would have been neither new China nor new Tibet," Xi said. "The CPC Central Committee's guidelines and policies concerning Tibet work are completely correct."  Xi stressed efforts to strengthen developing border areas, emphasized the four major issues of stability, development, ecology and border-area consolidation, and called for new achievements in protecting the ecology of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and advancing its sustainable development.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  On Wednesday, Xi arrived at the Nyingchi Mainling Airport and went to the Nyang River Bridge, where he learned about the ecological preservation of the Yarlung Zangbo River and its tributary Nyang, as well as the construction of nature reserves. Xi underscored the importance of protecting and restoring the ecology of major river basins.  During a visit to the city planning hall of Nyingchi, Xi called for scientifically delineating the boundaries of urban development and drawing the red lines for protecting ecosystems.  In the village of Galai, Xi went to the home of Dawa Gyaltsen and chatted with the family in the living room.  Xi said the village epitomizes the economic and social achievements Tibet has made over 70 years since its peaceful liberation. He also hailed the village as a model of ethnic unity.  Xi later visited a city park in Nyingchi where he greeted dancing locals and tourists.  On Thursday, Xi went to Nyingchi Railway Station, learning about the overall design of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway and how the Lhasa-Nyingchi section has been operated since June 25. Aboard a train to regional capital Lhasa, Xi inspected the construction along the railway. He hailed the railway as a major move to boost Tibet's development and improve people's living standards.  On Thursday afternoon, Xi went to the Drepung Monastery located in the western suburbs of Lhasa. Xi acknowledged the contributions the monastery has made in upholding the leadership of the CPC, supporting the socialist system and safeguarding national unity.  Xi stressed fully implementing the Party's fundamental guidelines governing religious work, respecting the religious beliefs of the people, adhering to the principle of independence and self-governance in religious affairs.

On the street, people of various ethnic groups greeted Xi, who waved back.  At the Potala Palace square, Xi inquired about the protection and management of the palace, and he was also greeted by people of various ethnic groups at the square.  Xi said people of all ethnic groups had jointly contributed to the development of Tibet and written the history of Tibet. Through its course, the history provided ample examples of exchanges between Tibetan and other ethnic groups.  He said that at present, Tibet is at a new historical starting point of its development, and the Party's leadership must be upheld and the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics must be followed.  Xi joined officials and people of various ethnic groups to watch ethnic art performances on Thursday night.  On Friday morning, after hearing the reports of the Party committee and government of Tibet Autonomous Region on their work, Xi acknowledged the achievements the region has made in various fields and stressed efforts to strengthen social governance and ensure national security, social stability, and people's well-being.  The publicity and education work of building public awareness of ethnic unity and progress should be combined with the education work concerning core socialist values, patriotism, anti-secessionism, history, and Marxist concepts, Xi said.  He called for strengthening exchanges and interactions among ethnic groups, as well as building a stronger sense of identification with the country, the Chinese nation, the Chinese culture, the CPC, and socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Xi said development in all sectors should serve ethnic unity and progress, and should help improve people's livelihood and build consensus.  Stressing deepening reform and opening up, Xi said the building of major infrastructure including railways and roads should be accelerated.  He also noted the development of distinctive industries, the building of national bases for clean energy, and coordination between development and security.  Xi said the achievements made in poverty alleviation should be consolidated and expanded, in coordination with the extensive drive for rural vitalization.  He also stressed solid work in terms of the people's well-being, including employment, education, social security, medical services, elderly care, childcare, and housing.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The international community has spoken highly of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Xi Jinping's remarks at the CPC centenary ceremony on Thursday, which looked back on the party's glorious history and ahead to the bright future of the Chinese nation's great rejuvenation.  Addressing the ceremony at Tian'anmen Square, Xi, also Chinese president, said that all the struggle, sacrifice, and creation through which the CPC has united and led the Chinese people over the past hundred years has been tied together by one ultimate theme -- bringing about the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  Today, the image China presents to the world is one of a thriving nation that is advancing with unstoppable momentum toward rejuvenation, Xi said.  Foreign leaders, officials and experts noted that over the past 100 years, the CPC has led the Chinese people to overcome various difficulties and make great achievements, writing a glorious chapter in the history of both the Chinese nation and human civilization.  They said they believe that under the leadership of the CPC, China will make greater achievements in fulfilling the Chinese Dream of great national rejuvenation, as well as greater contributions to global development and human progress.  Greek international relations scholar Pella Karpathiotaki said that Xi, in his speech, outlined the CPC's great contributions to China's national independence, development and prosperity, and depicted the country's bright prospect of future development.  Under the leadership of the CPC, she noted, China has achieved the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and is forging ahead towards the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects.  "This is a phenomenon in the global economic history," and China would have not been as prosperous as today without the CPC, she said.  Elon Musk, chief executive of U.S. tech firm Tesla, tweeted that "the economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing, especially in infrastructure! I encourage people to visit and see for themselves."  Robert Griffiths, general secretary of the Communist Party of Britain, said that "the achievements of the CPC are undeniable, and are there for all to see."  He noted that nowadays, the Belt and Road Initiative and other ones proposed by China keep bringing opportunities for other countries to fast-forward their economic and social development.  Cambodian government chief spokesman Phay Siphan said that under the leadership of the CPC, China has attained great achievements in various fields and brought a better life to the Chinese people.  Siphan said that China has also made important contributions to safeguarding world peace and stability as well as to boosting international cooperation and the development of multilateralism.  Cavince Adhere, a Kenya-based international relations scholar, spoke highly of the CPC's people-centered philosophy and the contributions the CPC has made to the progress of mankind and the development of the whole world, saying that "with the CPC at the helm, China has become a strong voice of multilateralism."  The CPC's leadership has always been visionary and people-centered, said Humphrey Moshi, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.  According to the expert, there has always been close communication between the CPC and the Chinese people, which facilitates swift execution of decisions within the country, and China's success in fighting COVID-19 is a result of the country's effective structure of communication, coordination and execution.  The CPC has not only established a framework for China's sustainable and inclusive development, but also made landmark and unprecedented achievements, noted Charles Onunaiju, director of Nigeria's Center for China Studies.  The CPC, he added, has been the decisive social force in the construction of modern China. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Xi made the remarks Monday when addressing a group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.  Xi stressed the need to have a profound understanding of how important and necessary it is to improve the country's international communication, and to develop a voice in international discourse that matches with China's comprehensive national strength and international status.  Although China's influence on international discourse has notably improved since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the country faces new situations and tasks, he said.  Xi stressed greater efforts to construct China's own discourse and narrative, interpreting China's practices by its own theories.

On CPC's publicity, Xi urged greater efforts to help foreign audiences understand what the Party is pursuing is nothing but the Chinese people's well-being.  He also emphasized the efforts to introduce the Chinese culture abroad and strive to shape a reliable, admirable and respectable image of China.  Xi emphasized extensively promoting China's stand, wisdom and approach as the country has the ability as well as the responsibility to play a bigger role in global affairs and make greater contributions to jointly solving problems of humanity with other countries.  He said multilateralism must be promoted while unilateralism and hegemonism should be opposed so as to guide the international community to jointly shape a more just and equitable international order and forge a new type of international relations.  Xi called for carrying out people-to-people exchanges, cultivating capable professionals for international communication, studying its theories and better grasping its laws, so as to increase the appeal and effectiveness of the country's international communication and enlarge the circle of friends who understand China.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Sun Ruibo)  BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Sunday marks the 70th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has attached great importance to the development of Tibet Autonomous Region.  The following are some highlights of his quotes in this respect:  -- To govern the country well we must first govern the frontiers well, and to govern the frontiers well we must first ensure stability in Tibet.  -- Efforts must be made to build a new modern socialist Tibet that is united, prosperous, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful.  -- The CPC leadership, the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the system of regional ethnic autonomy must be upheld to carry out work related to Tibet.  -- Work related to Tibet must focus on safeguarding national unity and strengthening ethnic solidarity.  -- We must make improving people's livelihood and rallying public support the starting point and ultimate goal in the economic and social development.  -- More education and guidance should be provided for the public to mobilize their participation in combating separatist activities, thus forging an ironclad shield to safeguard stability.  -- Tibetan Buddhism should be guided in adapting to the socialist society and should be developed in the Chinese context.

(Gaoligong mountain national nature reserve/Handout via Xinhua)  BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- As the global community celebrates the International Day for Biological Diversity on Saturday, China is exploring a solution to tackle the universal issue of biodiversity loss under the leadership of President Xi Jinping.  Piloting a market-based mechanism for green growth, China is actively fostering a new man-nature relationship in which both can prosper, living together in harmony.  "Ecological environmental protection and economic development are intertwined and complement each other," said Xi during a recent study session attended by the country's top leaders.  "Building ecological civilization and promoting green and low-carbon circular development not only meets people's growing needs for a beautiful environment, but also promotes higher-quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable and safer development," he said.  By carrying out major biological conservation projects and improving the mechanisms to encourage the green transition, China's practice sheds light on how ecological strength can be turned into economic strength.  COMMUNITY OF LIFE  Surrounded by high mountains and deep valleys, the Gongshan Drung-Nu Autonomous County in southwest China's Yunnan Province is home to the Drung ethnic group, a small community that makes a living mainly by raising animals, especially bees.  As part of their beekeeping activity, local residents use as many as 38 kinds of plants to attract bees, build their homes and repel them where necessary. The bees pollinate local herbs, which people in the community sell to improve their lives.  The beekeeping techniques used by the Drung ethnic have been selected as a key biodiversity conservation project by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment to showcase the synergy that can exist between man and nature.  Addressing the Leaders Summit on Climate in April, Xi called on the international community to work together to foster a community of life for man and nature.  "We need to look for ways to protect the environment, grow the economy, create jobs and remove poverty, all at the same time," he said.  Just like the beekeeping project, the country's many ecological conservation efforts have disproved the assumption that there must be trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection.  The Yangtze River Economic Belt, covering nine provinces and two municipalities, is undergoing a green transition under Xi's leadership.  Stressing high-quality development of the region, Xi has reiterated that the restoration of the ecological environment of the Yangtze River should be a major priority.  Over the years, the country has shut down a large number of highly polluting and energy-intensive enterprises along the river and put into effect a 10-year fishing ban in pivotal waters to restore degrading biodiversity.  In the first quarter of this year, the region's 11 provinces and municipalities reported rapid economic growth, with their combined gross domestic product accounting for 46.5 percent of the country's total, higher than the 2020 and 2019 levels.  MARKET-BASED MECHANISM  To better coordinate economic development and environmental protection, China is actively exploring and improving a market-based mechanism for green growth.  China will establish a sound mechanism for realizing the value of ecological products so that the protection and restoration of the ecological environment can be awarded a reasonable return, while the cost of damaging the environment can be paid correspondingly, Xi said at the study session.  Under the guidance of Xi's thought on ecological progress, China issued a guideline in April, vowing to establish a basic policy framework for the realization of the value of ecological products by 2025.  The various problems surrounding ecological products, such as the difficulty of valuing and trading them, will have been effectively resolved by that time, and an incentive mechanism to encourage environmental protection will take shape.  The country's ability to transform ecological advantages into economic advantages will have been significantly enhanced by then, according to the guideline.  Governments at different levels have taken measures to include indicators of green growth into their evaluation systems.  China's southern tech hub Shenzhen has established a "gross ecosystem product" (GEP) accounting system, which is the total value of final ecosystem goods and services supplied to human well-being and sustainable economic and social development, according to the municipal bureau of ecology and environment.  The bureau said GDP will no longer be the sole measure of Shenzhen's development in the future, and GEP will become an important indicator for the city's green growth.  In addition to its efforts in achieving modernization that features harmony between nature and humans, China also aims to work closely with its global partners to restore the ecological balance on Earth, honoring its commitments while encouraging others to do so.  China will actively participate in global environmental governance, improve South-South cooperation, and cooperate with neighboring countries, Xi said.  In October this year, the country will host the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) in Kunming of Yunnan. Participants are expected to work out concrete plans for post-2020 global biodiversity protection. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The article by Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, will be carried by this year's 10th issue of the Qiushi Journal.  The article calls revolutionary museums and memorials, museums of Party history, and martyrs' cemeteries pools of revolutionary traditions.  Such resources offer vivid teaching materials to consolidate revolutionary ideals and convictions, the article notes, urging efforts to strengthen education on revolutionary traditions and patriotism and improve ideological and moral education for the young people.  "Every time I go to revolutionary base areas for inspections, I would visit local revolutionary memorial sites to demonstrate that the CPC always holds high the banner of revolution, remains committed to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continues to advance the undertaking pioneered by revolutionary forefathers," Xi said in the article.  Noting that the establishment of the political power of the CPC, the People's Republic of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics are all hard-earned achievements, the article calls for paying tribute to the revolutionary martyrs, remembering them and passing on their revolutionary legacy.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Chinese President Xi Jinping attended a video summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Beijing on Friday.  The leaders of the three countries exchanged in-depth views on cooperation in coping with climate change, as well as on China-Europe relations, anti-pandemic cooperation, and major international and regional issues.  Ali el-Hefny, Egypt's former ambassador to China, said that the gathering of China-France-Germany signals the three sides' firm stand for maintaining their obligations towards the climate and sends a very positive message to other countries to be part of the actions to reduce emissions.  The former ambassador hailed China as "a model for the international community in the field of tackling global emissions".  "The summit shows the commitment to climate action extends from China to Europe and this is essential if we are all going to implement the Paris Agreement which requires raising ambition in the next decade," Richie Merzian, director of Climate and Energy Program at the Australia Institute, told Xinhua.  Climate change is a global challenge that requires active participations of all countries in the world, said Humphrey Moshi, a professor at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.  This summit has set a good example for dealing with global issues such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic through international cooperation, said Moshi.  President Xi has announced that China will strive to bring carbon dioxide emissions to a peak before 2030 and become carbon neutral before 2060, said Ronnie Lins, director of the China-Brazil Center for Research and Business, adding that this is a major commitment, which reflects China's responsible attitude towards climate change.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Founded in 2001, the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) is committed to promoting regional economic integration and bringing Asian countries closer to their development goals.  Here are some of the remarks made by Chinese President Xi Jinping to encourage cooperation between Asian countries and collaboration between Asia and the rest of the world.  Sept. 16, 2014  Xi published a signed article titled "Let us become partners in pursuit of our dreams" prior to his state visit to Sri Lanka.  -- "As a Sri Lankan proverb goes, give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; and teach a man how to fish and you feed him for life," Xi said.  -- "China will put into practice its guiding principles for neighborhood diplomacy, i.e. amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in its cooperation with Sri Lanka in every way so that China's development may benefit the people of Sri Lanka to a greater extent," he said in the article.  April 19, 2015  Xi published a signed article titled "Long Live China-Pakistan Friendship" prior to his first-ever state visit to Pakistan.  -- "My friend's lovely image dwells in the mirror of my heart; I tilt my head slightly, and here it comes into my sight," Xi quoted a line from a Urdu poem.  -- "Committed to building a China-Pakistan community of common destiny, we cooperate to expand our converging interests and strive for common development. Our aim is to deliver even more benefits to our peoples and realize brighter development prospects," Xi said.  Nov. 19, 2018  Xi published a signed article titled "Open up a New Future Together for China-Philippine Relations" ahead of his state visit to the Southeast Asian country.  -- "As a Philippine proverb goes, 'Seize today, or you will lose tomorrow.' China will work with the Philippines to seize the opportunity and go along with the trend of our time," Xi said.  -- "China welcomes the Philippines and other countries on board the express train of its development. China will work with other countries to firmly uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading system and promote the evolution of the international political and economic order in a fairer and more equitable direction," he said.  Nov. 10, 2020  Xi sent a congratulatory letter to the opening of the first conference of the International Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation of the BFA.  -- A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation is on the upswing in today's world, bringing about profound changes to human development and offering a new path for solving and responding to difficulties and challenges for global development, Xi said.  -- Noting that the world is now facing the COVID-19 pandemic and other various challenges, he said China stands ready to work with countries worldwide to strengthen scientific and technological innovation and cooperation, and push for more open, inclusive and mutually beneficial international exchanges in the area, so as to contribute to promoting the global economic recovery and safeguarding people's health.  Nov. 20, 2020  Xi addressed the 27th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing via video link.  -- "There is a Malay proverb that goes, 'bukit sama didaki, lurah sama dituruni,' which means to climb the hill together and go down the ravine together. It aptly captures the spirit of our Asia-Pacific family. COVID-19 serves as another reminder that only solidarity and cooperation can enable us to prevail over challenges," Xi said.  Jan. 25, 2021  Xi addressed the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda.  -- "China will continue to share its experience with other countries, do its best to assist countries and regions that are less prepared for the pandemic, and work for greater accessibility and affordability of COVID-19 vaccines in developing countries," Xi said.  March 29, 2021  Xi held a telephone conversation with Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  -- China stands ready to work with Sri Lanka to boost bilateral cooperation and provide robust impetus for the latter's post-pandemic economic recovery and sustainable development, Xi said.  He suggested that the two countries steadily push forward major projects like the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port, and promote high-quality collaboration in jointly building the Belt and Road.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Chinese President Xi Jinping answered these "fundamental questions of our time" at the annual conference of Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in 2018, vowing to open China further and calling for building a community with a shared future for humanity.  The past three years have seen China's persistent efforts in translating the opening-up initiatives Xi put forward into reality, sharing the opportunities of China's development with the rest of the world.    Photo taken on April 17, 2021 shows the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) International Conference Center in Boao Town, south China's Hainan Province. (Xinhua/Yang Guanyu)  A NEW PHASE OF OPENING-UP  Xi announced a batch of opening-up measures at the annual conference of BFA in 2018, with the expectation that the country's opening-up efforts will benefit all enterprises and people in China and around the world as soon as possible.  The measures included significantly broadening market access, creating a more attractive investment environment, strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights and taking the initiative to expand imports, among others.  "Opening-up is a strategic decision made by China based on its need for development as well as a concrete action taken by China to move economic globalization forward in a way that benefits people across the world," Xi said.  Accordingly, China put into effect the landmark foreign investment law on Jan. 1, 2020. The law grants foreign-invested enterprises access to government procurement markets through fair competition and bans using administrative licensing and penalties to force foreign investors to transfer technology.  The negative list for overseas investors was shortened time and again to further ease market access.  More specifically, the country scrapped foreign ownership restrictions on the automotive industry in 2018, with overseas car-making giants such as BMW and Tesla responding quickly by expanding their presence in the Chinese market.

(Xinhua/Pan Yulong)  While accelerating the development of 21 pilot free trade zones nationwide, China released a master plan of building Hainan, the southernmost province where the BFA is held, into a globally influential and high-level free trade port by the middle of the century.  This month, the country unveiled more policies to further liberalize and facilitate trade in the Hainan free trade port, allowing certain regions to relax their control of import and export qualifications for and quantities of commodities such as crude oil, refined oil and sugar, and cancel their licensing systems for imports such as mechanical and electrical products.  Figures speak for themselves. As global capital flows remain volatile due to uncertainties triggered by COVID-19, foreign direct investment into the Chinese mainland, in actual use, expanded 6.2 percent year on year to a record high of 999.98 billion yuan (about 153.16 billion U.S. dollars) last year.  The latest data also showed that the country's total imports and exports of goods surged 29.2 percent year on year to 8.47 trillion yuan in the first quarter of this year.

(Xinhua/Pu Xiaoxu)  A SHARED FUTURE  BFA was founded in 2001 when Asian countries sought economic integration in the aftermath of the 1998 financial crisis. Two decades after its inception, the world again stands at a critical moment in history.  Facing a world with growing anti-globalization sentiment, populism, unilateralism and protectionism, China has come up with its own vision of global governance.  Xi called on BFA participants in 2015 and 2018 to build "a community with a shared future for humanity," pursuing an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity.  China, together with many countries, is working to put this concept into practice.  A total of 138 countries and 31 international organizations have signed cooperation agreements with China on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which aims to achieve policy, infrastructure, trade, financial and people-to-people connectivity along and beyond the ancient Silk Road trade routes.  "The initiative, meeting the development needs of China, countries along the routes and the region at large, will serve the common interests of relevant parties and answer the call of our time for regional and global cooperation," Xi said when addressing the annual conference of BFA in 2015.

(Xinhua/Lu Boan)  Meanwhile, the China-proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which has grown to 103 approved members worldwide, has been dedicated to promoting infrastructure construction, regional connectivity and mutual development in Asia.  By January, the bank had provided over 22 billion U.S. dollars in infrastructure investment for its members and approved 108 projects.  Between April 2020 and Oct. 16, 2021, the bank's crisis recovery facility will offer up to 13 billion U.S. dollars worth of financing to both public and private sector entities in AIIB members facing or at risk of adverse pandemic-induced impacts.  Xi said the BRI and the AIIB are both open initiatives. China welcomes all countries along the routes and in Asia, as well as friends and partners around the world, to actively participate in these endeavors.  In the meantime, China has also played an active role in global environmental governance and is willing to work with others to build a green home.

(Xinhua/Li Xin)  Xi has on many occasions called for joint efforts from the international community to tackle climate change and other environmental challenges and protect the blue planet.  He announced at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly that China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.  "To scale up efforts to address climate change and promote sustainable development bears on the future of humanity," Xi said in his special address at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda this January.  Over the years, the BFA has witnessed how China, as the host country, firmly supported the development of the forum and committed to advocating dialogue and cooperation among Asian countries.  The forum, now celebrating its 20th anniversary, has not only played a unique role in pooling consensus and putting forward valuable "Boao proposals," but also engaged countries outside of Asia in addressing global issues and promoting world development and prosperity.  This year's annual conference, welcoming more than 2,600 attendees from more than 60 countries and regions offline, is themed "A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation."

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping attended a video summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Beijing on Friday.  The leaders of the three countries exchanged in-depth views on cooperation in coping with climate change, China-Europe relations, anti-pandemic cooperation, and major international and regional issues.  Xi stressed that he always advocates building a community with a shared future for humanity and stands ready to strengthen cooperation with France and Germany on addressing climate change.  "I announced that China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It means China, as the world's largest developing country, will complete the world's most dramatic reduction in carbon emission intensity, and realize carbon neutrality from carbon peaking in the shortest time in global history," he said.  He said the task is extremely challenging but China will deliver on its promise.  Xi said China has included carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in its overall plan for ecological conservation, and promoted the development of a green and low-carbon circular economy in an all-round way. China has decided to accept the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and strengthen the control of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), he added.  Responding to climate change is the common cause of all humanity, he said, adding that it should not be a bargaining chip for geopolitics, a target for attacking other countries, or an excuse for trade barriers.  Xi said China will adhere to the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, promote the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, and actively develop South-South cooperation on climate change.  It is hoped that developed economies will set an example in reducing emissions and take the lead in fulfilling their funding commitments to provide adequate technical and capacity-building support for developing countries to tackle climate change, Xi said.  Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading globally, and the world faces daunting tasks in global economic recovery, Xi said China-Europe relations are facing new development opportunities and various challenges. He called for firmly grasping the overall development direction of China-Europe ties from a strategic height.  China will expand high-level opening-up and create a fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for foreign-invested enterprises, including French and German companies, he said. He expressed the hope that Europe can also treat Chinese enterprises with such a positive attitude and work together with China to strengthen the China-Europe green and digital partnerships and enhance cooperation in combating the pandemic.  Xi said China opposes "vaccine nationalism" and a man-made vaccine divide, and is willing to work with the international community, including France and Germany, to ensure timely access to vaccines for the developing world.  China stands ready to work with the International Olympic Committee to provide vaccines to athletes preparing to enter the Olympic Games, he said.  Macron said that France welcomes China's announcement to become carbon-neutral before 2060. Such a massive commitment reflects China's initiative to assume significant responsibilities. France is willing to work with China to promote the further progress of France-China and Europe-China economic relations, help Africa achieve green development, and help developing countries reduce their debt.  Vaccines should not become a tool for competition among major countries, Macron said. He added that France is willing to strengthen cooperation with China on the equitable distribution of vaccines and strengthen coordination on regional issues, including the Iran nuclear issue.  Merkel said that it is extremely important for Germany, France, and China to strengthen cooperation in tackling climate change. The nationally determined contributions China announced are both ambitious and challenging and are very important in coping with climate change globally.  She said that Europe is willing to strengthen policy communication and alignment with China. China's economy realized a recovery growth first, which is good news for the world. Germany values the opportunities that the implementation of China's 14th Five-Year Plan brings to Germany-China and Europe-China cooperation, and is willing to deepen mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation with China, strengthen communication on issues such as the digital economy and network security, and treat enterprises from all countries equally and avoid trade barriers.  She expressed the hope that with joint efforts from both sides, the EU-China investment agreement will take effect at an early date.  The three leaders agreed that it is necessary to uphold multilateralism, fully implement the Paris Agreement, and jointly build a fair, reasonable, cooperative, and win-win global climate governance system, and promote this summit to achieve positive, balanced, and pragmatic results.  They agreed to strengthen climate policy dialogue and green development cooperation, and make climate change cooperation an important pillar in China-Europe cooperation.  All sides agreed to coordinate in running the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to be held this year in China's Kunming, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Britain, and the 7th International Union for Conservation of Nature's World Conservation Congress in the French city of Marseilles, to create a new pattern of global environmental governance.  The three leaders agreed to support COVAX, promote the healthy, safe, and orderly personnel exchanges, safeguard the smooth and stable industrial chain and promote the international economic and trade cooperation return to normalcy at an early date.  They also support the development of energy supply in developing countries in an efficient, clean, and diversified direction.  &nbsp;    Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a video summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Beijing, capital of China, April 16, 2021.

[Photo/Xinhua]  BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee (CPCCC) and Chinese President Xi Jinping extended gratitude to Cuban leaders for their congratulations on China's complete victory in poverty alleviation.  Xi made the remarks in a reply letter recently to Raul Castro Ruz, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Central Committee, and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel.  Noting China and Cuba are good friends, good comrades and good brothers, Xi said that in recent years, the two countries' traditional friendship has been deepening and their friendly cooperation has undergone all-round development.  In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, China and Cuba have stood together and supported each other, which has enhanced their friendship, he added.  Xi said that China will, as always, support Cuba in keeping to the path of socialism and push bilateral relations to higher levels.  Castro and Diaz-Canel wrote to Xi earlier, extending warm congratulations, on behalf of the Communist Party of Cuba, the Cuban government and people, on China's complete victory in poverty alleviation.  They spoke highly of China's remarkable achievement in eradicating absolute poverty under the strong leadership of the CPCCC with Xi at its core, which has met the poverty eradication target set in the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.  Cuba stands ready to unswervingly deepen the two countries' friendly cooperative relations, they added.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

As we speak, many children on this planet are subjected to the horror of armed conflicts," Xi noted in the speech.  -- "We need a mind that is broader than the sky as we approach different civilizations ... we should seek wisdom and nourishment from various civilizations to provide support and consolation for people's mind, and work together to tackle the challenges facing mankind," Xi said seven years ago.  -- "Civilizations have become richer and more colorful with exchanges and mutual learning. Such exchanges and mutual learning form an important drive for human progress and global peace and development," noted Xi in 2014, proposing to the world China's understanding of harmony, which is deeply rooted in the spirit of the Chinese people.  BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- "We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace," Chinese President Xi Jinping said in 2014 at the headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris.  Seven years have passed, but Xi's vision of civilization featuring diversity, equality and inclusiveness in his UNESCO keynote speech is still reverberating in a world that is grappling with the raging COVID-19 pandemic, as well as global political and socio-economic challenges.  SEEDS OF PEACE  "Throughout the centuries, people have yearned for lasting peace, but war has haunted mankind every step of their progress. As we speak, many children on this planet are subjected to the horror of armed conflicts," Xi noted in the speech.  Indeed, for quite some time, people in Syria, Libya, Afghanistan and other countries in turmoil have been suffering from unimaginable violence and indignities. Stigmatization, xenophobia, racism and discrimination as well as hate speech have also been running wild in many parts of the world.  Dima al-Kaed, a Syrian citizen, told Xinhua she has lost both her parents during the war. "I once dreamed of changing the world, but the war has changed my dream," she said, holding a photo of herself taken when she graduated from the University of Damascus years ago.  Faiz Ahmed, an Afghan citizen living in the city of Kabul who is about to reach his 50s, said he has spent almost his whole life in an environment of war and violence. "I have not seen a single day of peace in my homeland. I hope that my country could achieve lasting peace and stability as soon as possible, and I pray to experience such a day."  "Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed," Xi stressed on the importance of the idea of peace in his speech, quoting the preamble to the Constitution of UNESCO as saying.  To keep war as far away as possible from mankind, Xi has provided the answer -- to "step up inter-civilization activities in education, science, technology and culture across border, time and space to spread the seeds of the idea of peace far and wide so that they will sprout, take root and grow in the hearts and minds of the world's people, and provide the planet we share with more and more forests of peace."  These are not empty talks. In fact, guided by Xi's wisdom on peace, which has been revealed time and again through his remarks on various occasions, China has been making great contributions to regional and global stability, development and prosperity.  China is now the largest contributor of personnel to United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Moreover, the country has played a constructive role in addressing global issues such as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the conflicts in the Middle East.    Anita Kiki Gebe, deputy joint special representative of the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), awards UN peace medal to a soldier of the 2nd China Medium Utility Helicopter Unit (CMUHU02) in El-Fashir, Sudan, July 17, 2019. (Xinhua)  China always "works to resolve conflicts with peaceful methods and giving priority to the logic of humanity and the logic of the international law over the logic of force and hegemony," said Muhammad Zahra, a Syrian expert on China affairs.  The idea of peace espoused by Xi "does resonate very well with the fundamental principles of harmonious coexistence between people," said Cavince Adhere, an international relations researcher in Kenya. "We have seen this to be the basis of Chinese engagement both at home and abroad."  BROADER MIND  "We need a mind that is broader than the sky as we approach different civilizations ... we should seek wisdom and nourishment from various civilizations to provide support and consolation for people's mind, and work together to tackle the challenges facing mankind," Xi said seven years ago.  His remarks still bear profound significance now, as the world has yet to walk out of the severe global public health crisis -- diversity will support and enrich the global efforts against COVID-19.  While COVID-19 vaccines must be a global public good, accessible and affordable for all, as emphasized by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in February, some Western countries have stockpiled large quantities of vaccines against the virus, creating stark inequity between the rich and the poor.  According to a report by The New York Times on Monday, residents of wealthy and middle-income countries have received about 90 percent of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered so far.  Against such a backdrop, China, as a responsible major country with a broader mind to help humanity prevail against the common enemy, has not only delivered medical supplies and sent expert teams to places in need at the early stage of the fight, but also made an all-out effort to promote the fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.  So far, China has provided vaccine assistance to 80 countries in need, and is exporting vaccines to 47 countries. It has also decided to provide 10 million vaccine doses to the multilateral vaccine alliance COVAX to meet the urgent needs of developing countries, and to donate vaccines to UN peacekeepers.  As the second batch of the Sinovac vaccines donated by China arrived in the Philippines on Wednesday, Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque said "the arrival of these vaccines could not have occurred at a more opportune time considering the continued rise in cases."

(Xinhua/Rouelle Umali)  "China the lion has awakened, but it is a peaceful, amicable and civilized lion," Xi said in 2014 at a gathering marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic relations, stressing that the Chinese dream is about pursuing peace, questing for happiness, and contributing to the common good of the world.  "As the (Chinese) vaccines were released and aided, this becomes the biggest proof of China's sincerity of intentions and its willingness to lend a helping hand and reaching out to everyone who needs it," Ahmed Bahaa El-Din Shaaban, secretary-general of the Egyptian Socialist Party, told Xinhua.  What China is doing is "beyond nationalism," said Farhat Asif, president of the Islamabad-based Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies. "It's not for the one nation, and it's (for) a community of the shared future. When you're saving somebody, when you're saving a life, it's also saving humanity."  HARMONY WITHOUT UNIFORMITY  "Civilizations have become richer and more colorful with exchanges and mutual learning. Such exchanges and mutual learning form an important drive for human progress and global peace and development," noted Xi in 2014, proposing to the world China's understanding of harmony, which is deeply rooted in the spirit of the Chinese people.  In today's uncertain world, where protectionism, unilateralism and the so-called "clash of civilizations" are on the rise, and where some Western countries are forming cliques, turning back the wheel of history, inciting division along ideological lines, or instigating confrontation between different groups, Xi's remarks have become even more thought-provoking.  "To meet our common challenges and create a better future for all, we look to culture and civilization to play their role, which is as important as the role played by economy, science and technology," Xi said in 2019 at the opening ceremony of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations.  Through a series of global events, and within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS that groups emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the Belt and Road Initiative, and other organizations, Xi has continuously stressed the wisdom of "harmony without uniformity," which the Chinese have come to appreciate. Over the past seven years, during his trips to other countries, the Chinese president has offered to the world the Chinese idea of upholding inclusiveness.

(China Gezhouba Group Corporation/Handout via Xinhua)  China has initiated an important dialogue among civilizations, sharing with other countries the ideas that the only way of peaceful coexistence is through understanding, through communication to resolve all differences, said Asif, adding this is "the essence of China's peaceful scene at the global level."  "On international exchanges as an avenue of cementing peace and development across the world, China has also played a very key role," said Adhere.  For example, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has become a key platform to promote multi-civilizational exchanges between China and African countries, he said, adding it is only through these exchanges that people can have mutual understanding.  "This decision by China to promote civilizational exchanges is a key component. It speaks to the aspiration of the UN, the multilateral settings, and it's something that eventually leaves every human being better," he said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

He researched local efforts in implementing the guiding principles of the fifth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, facilitating a good start in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), and coordinating regular epidemic control and economic and social development.  On Monday afternoon, Xi visited the Wuyishan National Park, one of the pioneers in piloting the national park system.

He also stressed more efforts in implementing the arrangements to dispatch technical professionals to rural areas to help with local development.  After the tea farm, Xi visited a park dedicated to Zhu Xi, a renowned Chinese philosopher of the 12th century. The president called for innovative efforts to transform and develop fine traditional Chinese culture.  While visiting Shaxian District of Sanming on Tuesday, Xi made his first stop at Shaxian General Hospital where he learned about the reform of local medical and healthcare system and emphasized that people's health is a hallmark of socialist modernization.

In his message, Xi said that over the past half a century since the establishment of their diplomatic ties, China and Cameroon have been standing side by side through thick and thin, and the traditional friendship between the two countries has grown stronger with time.  In recent years, the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries have enjoyed a strong momentum of development with deepening political mutual trust and fruitful results in practical cooperation, Xi said.

Back in the early 1990s, inspired by some villagers who made big profits by peddling local cuisine in big cities, Yu, from Yubang Village, Shaxian District in the city of Sanming, tried to talk the whole village into following in their footsteps.  Now, over 90 percent of the village's laboring population is in the snack business in cities across the country, satisfying customers with Shaxian delicacies including peanut butter noodles, wontons filled with juicy meat, fried rice noodles and meat soup.  During an inspection tour in Fujian Province from Monday to Thursday, President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited the village, where he underlined that the key to rural vitalization lies in developing industries that suit local conditions and benefit local people.  Yubang is now hailed as the origin of the Shaxian Delicacies eateries that have risen to popularity across the country.  With great variety, widely accepted flavors and affordable prices, Shaxian Delicacies has emerged as one of the pillar industries in Shaxian.  Xi has highlighted the important role that local snacks and similar industries can play in driving rural development.  In a visit to Shaxian in March 1999, Xi, then deputy Party chief of Fujian, said the secret to the success of Shaxian Delicacies was finding a niche market and a low-margin but high-volume business model, and called for expanding the snack industry.  The next year, Xi revisited Shaxian, urging efforts to strengthen the tertiary sector with its pillar snack industry as a new driver of economic growth.  "His words helped me see the prospects in making Shaxian eateries into a restaurant chain like McDonald's and KFC, so I gathered my courage to open an outlet outside my hometown that December," said Lin Yingjiang, a Shaxian native.  In the following years, many locals like Lin traveled afar to populate Shaxian Delicacies franchises throughout China and even abroad.  To promote the snack industry, Shaxian, previously a county, has drawn up more than 40 documents, granted 532 million yuan (about 81.56 million U.S. dollars) in loans for start-ups and provided more than 23,000 free training courses in management and production skills over the past two decades.  Inspired by Xi's instruction, Shaxian has found new success through industrial upgrades in recent years.  Once a scattering of husband-and-wife eateries, Shaxian Delicacies is now a food chain with around 88,000 storefronts worldwide with more than 300,000 employees, generating a yearly turnover of nearly 50 billion yuan.  The booming snack industry has helped increase Shaxian's rural per capita annual income from 2,805 yuan in 1997 to 21,855 yuan in 2020.  It has also helped lift more than 200,000 people in Shaxian and its adjacent areas out of poverty, amid the country's vigorous anti-poverty efforts that have seen nearly 100 million rural residents shake off poverty over the past eight years.  To consolidate poverty alleviation outcomes and promote rural vitalization, China plans to support the formerly impoverished rural areas in developing and expanding industries featuring local characteristics.  Xi has attached great importance to the development of industries that fit local conditions in rural vitalization.  During his Fujian trip, he also visited a tea farm in Wuyishan City. "In the past, the tea industry was a pillar in your fight against poverty, and it should become a pillar industry of rural vitalization in the future," Xi said.  During an inspection trip to the southwestern Guizhou Province in February this year, Xi visited a Miao embroidery workshop and applauded its role in promoting rural vitalization.  In May 2020, when inspecting the northern Shanxi Province, Xi visited an organic daylily farm and said the daylily industry can become a big industry with great prospects.  With vast greenery and good ecological environment, Sanming's eco-tourism industry has maintained strong momentum. Last year, the city's eco-tourism industry alone generated a total revenue of 75 billion yuan.  In Guifeng, an 800-year-old village in Sanming known for its well-preserved ancient buildings, around 180,000 tourists have visited the village each year in the recent period.  "The scenery in my hometown is really beautiful," said 33-year-old villager Cai Wenjiang, a former migrant worker who has returned home and started a homestay business. "I hope more people will come and enjoy its beauty." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The flowers, which blossom among lines of tea bushes, were not planted for their aesthetic appeal, nor for their oil-yielding seeds, but as a source of green manure and natural insect repellent, said Yang, owner of the 21-hectare tea farm.  The ecological tea farm is part of the polyculture project of Liao Hong, an agronomist at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University and a sci-tech expert sent to spearhead innovation in rural areas by the local government. Liao has provided technical support for the tea farm since 2018. Her team has trained thousands of agricultural technicians and farmers in different places in Fujian.  President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected Yang's tea farm on Monday.  Xi was delighted to learn that the quality of tea has improved and farmers' incomes have increased as ecologically friendly methods are used in the farm over the years under the guidance of technical professionals.  "We should sum up the experience and system of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas, and continue to improve, consolidate and adhere to it," said Xi.  China's mechanism of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas aims to popularize agricultural science and technology, spearhead sci-tech innovation and entrepreneurship there, and help lead villages out of poverty and promote rural vitalization.  The practice was initiated in 1999 when the local government in the city of Nanping, Fujian, sought to upgrade its unproductive rural economy.  For a start, a total of 225 sci-tech experts were sent to the rural areas of Nanping to offer guidance for farmers in their daily work.  In 2002, Xi, then governor of Fujian Province, appreciated the measure of Nanping in an article, saying it was a useful exploration in innovating rural work. In the same year, the measure of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas was piloted in several other provinces and regions. It was promoted nationwide in 2009 and has gained bigger institutional support from the central authorities since 2012.  In his important instructions made on the 20th anniversary of the system of sending sci-tech experts to rural areas in 2019, President Xi encouraged sci-tech experts working in rural areas to uphold their original aspiration and make new and greater contributions to poverty alleviation and rural vitalization.  As a grape growing expert in the agricultural bureau of Nanping, Xie Fuxin used to ride a bicycle to grape greenhouses in the countryside of Nanping to offer technical instruction, carrying a bag that was loaded with a lunchbox and shears to prune and graft vines.  Xie was nicknamed the "grape wizard" by local farmers, for he was adept at explaining sophisticated terms in simple language, and more importantly, his growing techniques were quite effective.  Over the past 20 years, Xie has trained over 10,000 grape farmers and helped expand the planting acreage of the fruit to over 4,200 hectares across Nanping, which generates 600 million yuan (about 92 million U.S. dollars) every year and has lifted thousands of local farmers out of poverty.  China has sent nearly 300,000 sci-tech experts to rural areas in poverty alleviation efforts since 2012, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology.  China has made rural vitalization a priority to promote growth in the countryside over the next five years. Initiatives in science and technology are being introduced in rural areas to promote modern agriculture.  "I am proud that my work has helped many farmers increase their incomes. I just want to contribute more to farmers and the rural economy," Xie said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"Even mountains and seas cannot distance people with common aspirations," Xi said in his speech, noting that the vast Pacific Ocean cannot stand in the way of the profound friendship between the Chinese and Colombian people.  Over the past 41 years since the establishment of their diplomatic ties, the China-Colombia relations have achieved historic development, Xi said, with China becoming Colombia's second largest trading partner and China-invested enterprises actively participating in Colombia's development in various fields.  Cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two sides are flourishing, and the China-Colombia friendship is deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples, Xi said.  In the face of the unexpected COVID-19 outbreak, Xi stressed that the two countries have worked in unity to help each other overcome difficulties and actively carried out anti-pandemic cooperation.  Two batches of Chinese vaccines purchased by Colombia have been delivered to the South American country not long ago, Xi said, adding that the latest batch of vaccines arrived today to help boost the national vaccination program of Colombia.  Xi said he hopes that the governments and peoples of the two countries will make joint efforts to strengthen friendly cooperation in various fields including the anti-pandemic fight, so as to elevate China-Colombia friendly cooperation to a new level from a new historical starting point and bring more benefits to the two peoples.  Duque, who was on a tour of inspection during the day, held a special ceremony and broadcasted Xi's speech to the whole country. He expressed gratitude to Xi and the brotherly Chinese people for their deep friendship to the Colombian people and their important support to Colombia's fight against the pandemic.

(Xinhua/Mao Siqian)  BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The ninth meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, chaired by President Xi Jinping on Monday, analyzed the pros and cons of the country's platform economy, stressing the need to promote its healthy development from the strategic height of fostering new advantages in national competitiveness.  The high-profile meeting emphasized the strategic role of the platform economy in fostering national competitiveness and made a clear-cut judgment on how to promote its healthy development, heralding new development opportunities for the sector.  Addressing the meeting, Xi, also head of the committee, said the development of China's platform economy is now at a critical stage and it is necessary to focus on the long-term goals and tackle the needs of current development at the same time.  Industrial regulators such as the National Development and Reform Commission, the People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Market Regulation tabled reports at the meeting, which marked the latest policymaking development involving the platform economy.  With its business closely related to people's lives, China's platform economy has grown to over 2.39 trillion U.S. dollars as of early April in 2020, according to statistics from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  Digital marketplace firms each with over 1 billion U.S. dollars market value in China had increased to 193 by the end of 2019. By then, the total market value of online marketplaces had grown nearly 200 percent to 2.35 trillion U.S. dollars from 2014.

(Xinhua/Xiao Yijiu)  STRATEGIC HEIGHT  "Reviewing the sector's development from a strategic height means the policy orientation of encouraging and supporting the development of the sector will not change, nor will relevant policies be weakened," said Fang Aiqing, deputy director of the economic committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee.  "This helps to unify the understanding of the sector's development from all walks of life and enables platform economy to secure faster, more stable and better development," he added.  According to Zhang Yansheng, chief researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, healthy development of online marketplaces will in turn help advance the country's economic transformation toward better quality, higher efficiency and stronger impetus.  The platform economy's roles mainly lie in its ability to make resource allocation across the country more efficient, promote faster and more rigorous transformation in the spheres of informatization, digitalization and smart technologies, smooth the circulation of the national economy and enhance and refine national governance, the meeting noted.

(Xinhua/Zhang Long)  BETTER SUPERVISION  However, problems and risks involving the sector have also caught the attention of policymakers and regulatory authorities.  Some large online marketplaces have done too much in tracking and collecting their users' digital footprints to push ads touting excessive consumption to those with fragile credit standing and thus lured them into the traps of unsecured consumer loans, said Dong Ximiao, a part-time researcher with the Institute for Financial Studies, Fudan University.  "Internet platforms improve the availability of financial products but often ignore their affordability, which could cause financial risks to pile up," he added.  Other latent risks ranging from data monopoly to deliberately circumventing regulation also trigger concerns. As current regulation is sector-specific, there exist certain regulatory gaps and loopholes. Supervision against cross-market, cross-sector and cross-domain financial risks needs to be strengthened, Dong said.  The meeting made it clear that all financial activities involving platform enterprises must be put under financial supervision to rectify the situation, while regulators need to consolidate their oversight capability under an optimized supervision framework.  It also reiterated the need to promote fair competition, oppose monopoly and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital as well as the need to strengthen the protection of the rights of all market entities involved in the platform economy and safeguard users' rights and interests in data and privacy.  The meeting had pointed out the direction for the healthy development of the platform economy, which was pursuing development with regulation optimized side by side, Zhang Yansheng said.

(Photo by Wang Jilin/Xinhua)  Another takeaway of the meeting, as analysts noted, is that the platform economy has been tasked with a mission to make contributions to high-quality economic development and improve the quality of life as the country ushers in its 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025).  In this regard, industrial internet platforms are encouraged to facilitate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries and foster the development of advanced manufacturing, while platform enterprises in the consumer sector will be supported to tap the country's consumption power and provide more quality products and services, the meeting noted.  The meeting also emphasized the need to boost opening-up and cooperation, foster a dynamic and innovative institutional environment, and strengthen international technical exchanges and research collaboration.  "More should be done to improve the weak links, create an environment for innovation, resolve prominent problems, and promote the regulated, healthy and sustainable development of the platform economy," Xi said.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Upholding the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged continued support to developing countries in curbing the deadly virus.  In a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Keith Rowley of Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday, Xi said since the COVID-19 epidemic broke out, the two sides have helped each other in times of adversity.  Trinidad and Tobago is the first among Latin American and Caribbean countries to donate aid materials to China, and China has also provided anti-epidemic supplies and technical assistance for Trinidad and Tobago through various channels, Xi said.  China is willing to strengthen vaccine cooperation with Trinidad and Tobago, and to continue to support the country in fighting the epidemic, Xi said.  On the same day, in a telephone conversation with Guyanese President Irfaan Ali, Xi said China and Guyana, though far apart, enjoy a deep and close friendship.  China stands ready to strengthen cooperation with Guyana in COVID-19 vaccines and continue to provide assistance and support within its capacity for Guyana's economic and social development, Xi added.  China has provided and is providing COVID-19 vaccine aid free of charge to 69 developing countries in urgent need, while exporting vaccines to 43 countries, according to official figures.  At the 46th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, China has called for a people-centered global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The country has urged strengthening cooperation on vaccine research and development, production and distribution, so as to make vaccine truly an accessible and affordable public good for the people of all countries, especially developing countries.  Earlier this month, in a phone conversation with Polish President Andrzej Duda, Xi said that China is willing to provide COVID-19 vaccines within its capabilities to Poland in accordance with the European country's demand.  Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China and Poland have been looking out for and helping each other, with the two sides engaging in cooperation in pandemic prevention and control as well as resumption of work and production, which opened a new chapter of their friendship, he said.  During his telephone conversation with his Tajik counterpart, Emomali Rahmon, the Chinese president pointed out that since last year, the Chinese and Tajik people, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the transformations rarely seen in a century, have sticked together through thick and thin, joined hands in unity and coordination, and achieved fruitful cooperation in various fields, especially in battling the pandemic.  Xi added that China is willing to provide assistance of COVID-19 vaccines to Tajikistan in a bid to promote the building of a community of common health for mankind.  In a phone conversation with Colombian President Ivan Duque in February, Xi said that China stands ready to continue to provide as much support as it can for Colombia's combat against the COVID-19 pandemic and to carry out vaccine cooperation with the country.

Stressing that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman founded the People's Republic of Bangladesh 50 years ago, Xi said Rahman, an old friend and a good friend of the Chinese people, visited China twice and developed friendship with Chinese leaders of the older generations.  Xi said the two sides should keep in mind contributions made to the bilateral relations by leaders of the older generations and carry forward bilateral friendship.  Since its independence, Bangladesh has made remarkable achievements in national construction, Xi said, adding China is glad about that as a friendly neighbour.  China and Bangladesh have been friendly neighbouring countries since ancient times, and the friendship spanning over a thousand years was witnessed by the Silk Road, Xi said. Over the last 46 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two sides have always treated each other with mutual respect and on an equal footing, offered mutual support and worked hand in hand, Xi added.  As China and Bangladesh are both at a crucial stage of national development, Xi said the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation and the dream of Sonar (golden) Bangla are interconnected, and the pragmatic cooperation between the two countries has delivered tangible benefits to the two peoples.  Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the two countries have been making joint efforts to overcome the difficulties and rendering mutual help, Xi said. Major projects in Bangladesh Chinese enterprises participated in have made groundbreaking progress, and the treatment of zero tariff for 97 percent of the taxable items imported from Bangladesh into China has officially taken effect, Xi added.  Stressing that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Bangladesh ties, Xi expressed the hope to work with Bangladesh to better align the two countries' development strategies and jointly promote the construction of the Belt and Road, so as to take the China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of cooperation to new heights.

(Photo by Xie Huiqiang/Xinhua)  BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Almost half a year after Chinese President Xi Jinping's pledge to make the country carbon-neutral before 2060, the roadmap to achieve the goal is getting clearer under Xi's push as authorities and industries scale up their green efforts.  China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, Xi announced at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly via video in September last year.  Since then, vigorous policies have been rolled out on top of the already hefty input in green development. At a meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs on Monday, Xi called for incorporating the peaking of carbon emissions and carbon neutrality into the overall layout of building an ecological civilization.  "Peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality is a tough battle, it is also a major test of the party's capabilities in governing the country," the meeting stressed.  While China's economic rise over the past decades was largely powered by coal, the country, now among the world's biggest investors in green energy, is increasing pace to shift to other renewables including wind and solar.  Starting in February, China implemented a set of interim rules for the management of carbon-emissions trading designed to drive down the emissions of big power users.  Under the scheme, firms that exceed the emission caps can buy emission quotas from others with a lower carbon footprint.  A total of 2,225 power firms are included in the project. More fields, such as the steel and aluminum production sectors, will be included in future carbon trading.  The campaign for green energy also enabled the public to embrace a more eco-friendly lifestyle, as was shown by the country's booming sales of new energy vehicles.  On the back of the united efforts, the share of clean energy consumption in the country has risen from 19.1 percent in 2016 to 24.3 percent in 2020, data by the National Bureau of Statistics showed.  While addressing the Climate Ambition Summit via video link in December last year, Xi announced that by 2030, China aims to lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 percent.  To move toward the goal, energy consumption per unit of GDP and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2021 will be reduced by 13.5 percent and 18 percent, respectively, according to this year's government work report, which also promised to draw up an action plan for peaking carbon emissions before 2030.  While expanding the use of green energy, bringing down carbon emissions to net zero, which means achieving a balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon, will require the development of new technologies to capture and store emissions.  Monday's meeting also called for efforts to push forward major breakthroughs in green and low-carbon technologies and accelerate the promotion and application of such technologies for reducing pollution and carbon emissions.  It has underscored improvements in policies on fiscal taxation, prices, finance, land and government procurement that are conducive to green and low-carbon development.  "To peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality is an extensive and profound systemic reform for the economy and society," Xi noted at Monday's meeting. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

XINING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Photos of two cute big cats from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau shown during the annual session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC) attracted many fans.  During a deliberation at the session on March 7, Kong Qingju, an NPC deputy from northwest China's Qinghai Province, showed photos of the two cats -- a snow leopard and a Chinese desert cat -- to President Xi Jinping.    Infrared photo taken on March 8, 2019 shows a snow leopard in Sanjiangyuan (Three-River-Source) National Park in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of northwest China's Qinghai Province. (Xinhua)  "Rare species that we rarely saw before are now showing up," said Kong, an education official in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai, who grew up at the foot of the Qilian Mountains. Now, local farmers turn to tourism, environment-friendly farming, husbandry or special agricultural industries which have raised their incomes.  The two kinds of rare cats are both on the country's top protection list and also "star species" in the Qilian Mountains National Park.    Infrared photo taken on July 3, 2020 shows a Chinese desert cat in the Qilian Mountains National Park in northwest China's Qinghai Province. (Xinhua)  "This shows that ecological protection efforts have worked," said Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, during his discussion with lawmakers from Qinghai. "The people's awareness of ecological protection has also been strengthened, and they have seen the economic value of ecology itself."  He stressed concrete efforts to give priority to ecology, promote high-quality development and create a high-quality life.  The Qilian Mountains is a major vast mountain range standing across the border of Gansu and Qinghai provinces, with an average altitude of over 4,000 meters. The range is an important water source of the Yellow River, China's second-longest, and a key ecological shield in western China.    Aerial photo taken on June 22, 2019 shows the scenery of Qilian Mountains in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, northwest China's Qinghai Province. (Xinhua/Wu Gang)  Due to prominent problems such as over-exploitation of mineral resources, illegal construction and operation of hydropower facilities and excessive emissions by local enterprises, the ecological environment of the Qilian Mountains suffered serious damage for a period of time, which aroused high attention from the central authorities.  Xi made important instructions several times on tackling the long-standing environmental violations in the Qilian Mountains, demanding resolute rectifications. In 2017, the central authorities punished senior officials of Gansu for their failure to undertake their duties.  He inspected the ecological restoration and protection work during an inspection tour in Gansu in 2019.  Qinghai has given priority to ecological protection and green development to better protect the ecology of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and meet people's aspirations for a better life.  The Qilian Mountains National Park covers 50,200 square km -- 34,400 square km in Gansu and 15,800 square km in Qinghai. It is home to many rare animal species, including snow leopards, wild donkeys and blue sheep.  After recent years of intensive restoration efforts, the populations of snow leopards, Tibetan wild donkeys, white-lipped deer and alpine musk deer have been expanding as the quality of their habitats was significantly improved.  In Namse township of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai, where the Lancang River flows through, 45 snow leopards have been spotted, and the township is thus dubbed as the "hometown" of snow leopards due to the frequent sightings of the big cat species.    Infrared photo taken on Jan. 17, 2019 shows a snow leopard in the Qilian Mountains National Park in northwest China's Qinghai Province. (Xinhua)  The township has piloted a franchise business model for tourism, training some herdsmen to serve as ecological guides to host visitors from around the world.  Forty-five percent of the franchise business revenue goes to the herdsmen, another 45 percent to the village and the remaining 10 percent to an ecological protection fund. The guides can earn some 10,000 yuan (about 1,540 U.S. dollars) a year.  Zhoima, a Tibetan woman living in Babao Township of Qilian County, Qinghai, recalled that the county, which is rich in mineral resources, used to be clustered with asbestos factories.  "The factories greatly affected the herders' lives," she said. "Whenever they operated, grey dust covered the whole pasture. When the sheep were slaughtered, asbestos residue was found in their intestines."  Since 2017, Qilian county, which is part of the Qilian Mountains National Park, has spent 613 million yuan on the ecological restoration project to bring back the original look of the mountains.    Aerial photo taken on June 22, 2019 shows a forest farm in Qilian County of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, northwest China's Qinghai Province. (Xinhua/Wu Gang)  With restoration efforts, Babao Township today has become a well-known scenic spot, featuring picturesque sceneries such as winding rivers, trickling water, snow-capped mountains and patches of shrubbery.  Herders who live nearby have also taken on new roles to protect the grassland as the province has offered ranger jobs for them.  Data provided by the Qinghai forestry and grassland administration shows that about 17,200 rangers in the province have an annual per-capita income of 21,600 yuan.  In 2020, the province offered about 1.88 billion yuan of subsidies to the farmers and herders in an ecological compensation program.  Experts noted that the concept of green development, while benefiting people, has become an important value to lead the construction of beautiful China and even to promote green and sustainable development globally.  "It is our eternal pursuit to promote harmony between man and nature and seek eco-friendly development. We will stick to the people-centered development concept, make Qinghai more beautiful and bring more benefits to the people," said Liu Tao, vice governor of Qinghai.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- President Xi Jinping on Monday stressed efforts to promote the regulated, healthy and sustainable development of the platform economy and incorporate the peaking of carbon emissions and carbon neutrality into the overall layout of building an ecological civilization.  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at the ninth meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs. He is also head of the committee.  The development of China's platform economy is now at a critical stage and more should be done to improve the weak links, create an environment for innovation, resolve prominent problems, and promote its regulated, healthy and sustainable development, Xi noted.  To peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality is an extensive and profound systemic reform for the economy and society, and should be incorporated into the overall layout of building an ecological civilization, Xi said.  He called for a spirit of perseverance in achieving the goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.  Other Chinese leaders Li Keqiang, Wang Huning and Han Zheng attended the meeting.  Attendees were briefed on measures for the healthy development of the platform economy, as well as strategies and major measures to bring the carbon emissions to a peak and achieve carbon neutrality.  To build the national competitive strengths, China will establish and improve the platform economy governance system, giving equal importance to development and regulation, amid efforts to boost fair competition, fight monopoly and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital, the meeting said.  It stressed the role of industrial Internet platforms in transforming traditional businesses and boosting advanced manufacturing.

(Xinhua/Mao Siqian)  BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- When the COVID-19 pandemic drained global economic confidence last year, China's dynamic market brought a sense of certainty.  Now at the ongoing annual "two sessions" where lawmakers and political advisors nationwide pool their wisdom into China's modernization drive, China reaffirms its decades-long commitment to opening-up.  China is ready to open more broadly and confident in its ability to do so, building on its strong recovery momentum. Last year, the country pulled ahead of the major economies to achieve positive growth, with its gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.3 percent year on year.    Photo taken on Nov. 5, 2020 shows the industrial robots of Nachi company from Japan at the Intelligent Industry and Information Technology exhibition area during the 3rd China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, east China. (Xinhua/Li Renzi)  Anticipating bullish growth in 2021, the country has set its annual GDP target at over 6 percent, boosting morale while leaving room for policy maneuver. Market expectations and forecasts by major international organizations point to higher growth. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development projected that China's GDP will rise 7.8 percent this year. No doubt, the China locomotive will continue to inject impetus to the pandemic-hit global economy.  China's integration into the world showed that there is no reason for the country to shut its doors. It is crystal clear that openness leads to prosperity, while closed doors invite obscurity.  This year marks the 20th anniversary of China's accession to the World Trade Organization. China has continuously contributed to the process of globalization and achieved win-win results alongside the rest of the world. Over the past two decades, the country's average annual contribution to world economic growth has neared 30 percent, while its overall tariff level has dropped from 15.3 percent to below 7.5 percent.  At this historic development juncture and the starting point of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), China's economy has embarked on a new journey with three major driving forces: scientific and technological innovation, the expansion of domestic demand, and reform and opening-up, which will help further unleash the vitality of the country's huge market.

In addition to opportunities, opening-up also brings new challenges. How can the world's second-largest economy continue to flourish amid intensified global competition?  "Facing new problems and challenges brought by globalization, we should not retreat into protectionism, isolation or decoupling, but work together to make globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all," State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during this year's "two sessions."

BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping has pointed the way for China, which is at a historic development juncture, by expounding on a wide range of topics at this year's "two sessions," a key political event slated to close on Thursday.  The two sessions are the country's annual meetings of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, participated in deliberations with national legislators and joined discussions with political advisors at the two sessions.  He took part in deliberations with other lawmakers from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province, and attended a plenary meeting of the delegation of the People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police Force. He also joined national political advisors from education, medical and health sectors in a joint group meeting.  2021 marks a historic juncture for China as it embarks on a new quest for fully building a modern socialist country. Here are some key takeaways from Xi's speeches at the sessions that may provide insights into China's development trajectory.

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)  GREEN GDP  Xi has always stressed adopting "a holistic approach" to conserving mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes and grasslands. This time, he brought "deserts" into the picture.  Top-level design and comprehensive measures are needed to protect the eco-systems in mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands and deserts, said Xi, an NPC deputy himself.  Highlighting the concept of "green GDP," Xi said that maintaining a good ecological environment is of enormous value.  ETHNIC UNITY  Xi stressed cementing the sense of community for the Chinese nation.  He called for promoting standard spoken and written Chinese language and the use of state-compiled textbooks.  Efforts should be made to facilitate more comprehensive understanding of the Party's policies concerning ethnic groups, especially among young people, Xi said.

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)  PEOPLE'S HEALTH AS "STRATEGIC PRIORITY"  Xi has stressed giving "strategic priority" to safeguarding people's health and focusing on tackling major diseases and problems that affect people's health.  The country's public health protection network should be fortified, and efforts should be made to promote the high-quality development of public hospitals, he said, demanding comprehensive health care for the people at all stages of life.  The fight against COVID-19 has once again proved that prevention is the most economical and effective health strategy, Xi said, calling for reforming and improving the disease prevention and control system.  Xi also urged the preservation and development of traditional Chinese medicine and breakthroughs in core technologies in key areas, as well as more protection, care and support for health workers.  QUALITY BASIC PUBLIC EDUCATION  On education, Xi said China must strive to build a high-quality and balanced basic public education service system.  He emphasized the socialist orientation in running schools, the non-profit nature of education and developing education that people are satisfied with.  Education is essential to the country and the Party, Xi stressed.  He called for efforts to train more talents who can contribute to the country's high-quality development and high-level self-reliance.  Teachers are the central pillar of education, and strengthening the professional ethics of teachers must be a top priority, Xi said.

It will not only be the requirement for developed regions, but will also be the requirement that entails implementation by all regions, Xi said, urging each region to pursue high-quality development based on local conditions.  He urged efforts to integrate high-quality development with action in meeting people's aspiration for a better life.  Xi stressed efforts to strengthen areas of weakness in people's well-being, unfailingly meet the basic living needs of the people and improve the availability and equality of basic public services.  He asked local authorities to promote coordinated development between rural and urban areas, advance rural vitalization on all fronts, improve people's well-being, and build a new socialist countryside that is beautiful, prosperous and harmonious.

(Xinhua/Li Gang)  COMBAT READINESS  Xi stressed achieving a good start in strengthening national defense and the armed forces during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) period.  Development of the armed forces must focus on combat readiness, he said.  Xi demanded efforts to step up building high-caliber strategic deterrence and joint operation systems.  He called for intensified efforts and more concrete measures in the pursuit of independent innovation in science and technology, to fully leverage the role of science and technology as the strategic support for military development.  Highlighting the "instabilities" and "uncertainties" in China's current security circumstances, Xi said the whole armed forces must always be ready to respond to all kinds of complex and difficult situations, resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and provide strong support for fully building a modern socialist country.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's "dual circulation" development paradigm, a major strategy championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and featuring domestic and overseas markets reinforcing each other with the domestic market as the mainstay, is under the spotlight during the country's ongoing annual "two sessions."  The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), a draft outline of which has been submitted to the country's top legislature and political advisory body for deliberation and discussion, will further clarify how China will implement the "dual circulation" strategy and achieve high-quality development.  Unleashing domestic demand is crucial to driving China's growth, but this new development paradigm does not mean China will backpedal on its opening-up, officials and experts have said.  STRATEGIC DECISION  In May 2020, the leadership of the Communist Party of China made a strategic decision to foster a new development pattern where domestic and foreign markets can boost each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay.  "Making the domestic market the mainstay does not mean we are developing our economy with the door closed," Xi told a symposium of entrepreneurs in July last year. By giving full play to the potential of the domestic market, both domestic and foreign markets can be better connected and utilized to realize robust and sustainable development, he said.  China will follow the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm, and pursue high-quality development by staying committed to deepening reform and opening wider to the world, Xi said when delivering a speech via video at the third Paris Peace Forum in 2020.  He stressed that China will also work with the rest of the international community to keep the global industrial and supply chains stable and to foster an open world economy.  China on Friday unveiled a draft blueprint for economic and social development over the next five years and clarified the long-range objectives through the year 2035, setting policy priorities for a new development stage that is crucial for the country to achieve socialist modernization.  The draft outline includes comprehensive and targeted measures echoing China's new development philosophy, said Xin Ming, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance).  PARALLEL EMPHASIS  Jochen Goller, chief of BMW Group Region China, said China's new development pattern of "dual circulation" is an effective strategy customized to the strength of the Chinese domestic market.  "'Dual circulation' puts a parallel emphasis both on domestic and international circulation. A high-level opening up certainly serves this end, brings win-win outcomes both for Chinese and multinational companies," he noted.  Alexander Lomanov, deputy director at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said the transition to the "dual circulation" model is an important stage in the development of China's economic policy.  "It has its own internal logic and the Chinese leadership has stressed the importance of domestic demand for years," he noted.  WIN-WIN CHOICE  Dual circulation is seen as a strategic and win-win choice for China to reshape its international cooperation and new competitive edge, said Justin Yifu Lin, former World Bank chief economist and honorary dean of the National School of Development at Peking University.  "China's economy has been deeply integrated into the global economy. As China enters the new stage of development, its ties with the world economy will get even closer," said Ji Zhiye, former head of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations who is also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.  Ji said the international capitals are optimistic about the Chinese market thanks to the country's business environment and economic resilience.  Zarko Obradovic, member of the Serbian parliament and president of the Friendship Group with China, said China's new development pattern featuring "dual circulation" would help the country take advantage of the development of the domestic market and make China an ideal economic partner.  Boga Thura Manatsha, senior lecturer at the Department of History of University of Botswana, said that China needs the world for its economy to continue growing and the global economy also needs China to make a sustained comeback.  "It is basically a win-win scenario," he said, noting that as the whole world, especially developing countries, has been hit hard by COVID-19, China has a critical role to play in reviving the world economy.

(Xinhua/Zhang Ling)  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's top political advisory body convened a biweekly consultation session on Friday at which attendees contributed their suggestions on further improving capacity building for those who love the country, and love Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions (SARs).  The session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was presided over by Wang Yang, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.  Highlighting the necessity and urgency of enhancing capacity building for the ranks of patriots who love the country, Hong Kong and Macao, Wang underscored the importance of adhering to the fundamental principles of "patriots administering Hong Kong" and "patriots administering Macao."  He urged efforts to unite the patriots and help them improve capabilities including enhancing political consciousness, forging close ties with the people and solving problems, so as to contribute to the realization of good governance in the SARs and ensuring the steady practice of "one country, two systems."  Ten political advisors and an invited representative spoke at the session, while over 90 political advisors voiced their opinions via an online platform.  They extended congratulations on John Lee's election as the six-term chief executive designate of the Hong Kong SAR with an overwhelming majority of votes and expressed confidence in Hong Kong's harmony, stability, prosperity and development.  The political advisors noted that, since the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, those who love the country, and love Hong Kong and Macao have done a lot of work and played an important role, and have withstood tests and shouldered responsibilities.  The political advisors suggested that high priority should be given to enhancing political integrity and capability in governance among the governing teams of the SARs.  For those in political and social organizations in the SARs who love the country and love Hong Kong and Macao, the political advisors suggested that efforts should be made to further strengthen their political stand, promote self-reform and strengthen internal management.  The political advisors also suggested attaching importance to uniting those from professional sectors, expanding the reserve force of those who love the country, and love Hong Kong and Macao, improving the composition of CPPCC members from the SARs, and strengthening patriotic education for young people in the SARs.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

As the world is plagued by major challenges, not least a pandemic unseen in a century, Chinese President Xi Jinping has on multiple occasions called on the international community to take concerted actions against the virus.  The following are some highlights of his remarks on how cooperation can help the world survive.  April 21, 2022  In his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, Xi stressed that we need to work together to defend people's lives and health.  For humanity to clinch a final victory against the COVID-19 pandemic, more hard efforts are needed. It is essential that countries support each other, better coordinate response measures and improve global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic, said Xi.  Jan. 17, 2022  At the virtual session of the 2022 World Economic Forum, Xi pledged to embrace cooperation on jointly overcoming the pandemic and champion economic globalization.  As COVID-19 is resurging with more variants and spreading faster than before, Xi stressed the importance of fully leveraging vaccines as a powerful weapon and ensuring the equitable distribution of vaccines to close the global immunization gap.  Xi called on countries to strengthen international cooperation against COVID-19, carry out active cooperation on the research and development of medicines, jointly build multiple lines of defense against the coronavirus, and speed up efforts to build a global community of health for all.  Dec. 31, 2021  China has provided 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations for the global COVID response, Xi said in his 2022 New Year Address.  "Only through unity, solidarity and cooperation can countries around the world write a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind," he said.  Nov. 29, 2021  China and Africa should fight COVID-19 with solidarity, deepen practical cooperation, promote green development, and uphold equity and justice, Xi said at the opening ceremony of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation via video link.  On fighting COVID-19 with solidarity, Xi stressed the need to truly ensure the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in Africa.  Oct. 31, 2021  While addressing the 16th G20 Leaders' Summit via video link, Xi said that at present, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered multiple crises.  The development achievements made by the international community over the years have been seriously eroded and developing countries are facing unprecedented challenges and tests, Xi pointed out.  The COVID-19 pandemic has once again shown that all countries, with high stakes in each other's future and converging interests, form a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi said, noting that promoting sustainable development in developing countries will benefit the people of the countries concerned, and also affect the future and destiny of the whole mankind and the Earth.  Sept. 24, 2021  While delivering a speech via video at the opening ceremony of the 2021 Zhongguancun Forum, Xi called on all countries to strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology.  Xi noted that nowadays profound changes unseen in a century are evolving rapidly in the world and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far-reaching, presenting severe challenges for the recovery of the global economy.  All countries in the world need to strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology, explore ways and means of jointly solving important global issues through sci-tech innovation, address the challenges of the times together, and promote the noble cause of peace and development for all, said Xi.

The country's renewed calls for infrastructure investment were reiterated at recent high-profile meetings chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission.  During the meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs on April 26, Xi, also head of the committee, urged all-out efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction in the country's endeavor toward a modern infrastructure system.  From traditional infrastructures, such as water conservancy and transportation networks, to the new infrastructures led by cloud computing and artificial intelligence platforms, the meeting discussed a wide range of infrastructure development topics and gave full consideration to the various needs related to China's future development.  Later that week, on April 29, a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, chaired by Xi, reiterated the need to comprehensively reinforce infrastructure construction.  These high-level announcements made during the two consecutive meetings highlighted the pivotal role of infrastructure in the national economy, said Sun Chuanwang, a professor at Xiamen University.  The moves will further stimulate investment potential in the infrastructure sector and bring opportunities for the relevant industries and enterprises, Sun added.  A flurry of pledges to ensure solid implementation followed. The Ministry of Transport, for instance, planned to advance infrastructure investment with a moderately proactive approach. Meanwhile, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) urged to expand infrastructure investment in the fields of industrial upgrades, urban and rural construction and national security.  Infrastructure serves as a pillar for economic and social development. Under Xi's leadership, China has made great advances in infrastructure construction, ranging from water conservancy and transportation projects, to information infrastructure, with the overall level improving in leaps and bounds.  Concerned about people's well-being in border areas, Xi urged efforts to advance the construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway project with high quality, in an instruction made ahead of the construction of the Ya'an-Nyingchi section of the railway in November 2020.  Describing the project as a vital step in facilitating the Party's general plan for governing Tibet in the new era, he stressed the project's important role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.  A few months later, aboard a train from Nyingchi Railway Station to the regional capital Lhasa, Xi inspected the construction along the railway and hailed the railway as a major move to boost Tibet's development and improve people's living standards.  With the country's modernization drive high on his agenda, Xi met with the main scientists and project leaders of China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, during his inspection trip in southwest China's Guizhou Province in February last year.  Noting that the FAST is a major national scientific and technological infrastructure, Xi stressed the importance of science and technology in China's pursuit of building a modern socialist country.  In addition to leveraging infrastructure investment to spur economic growth in the short term, China has also been striving to build technological and digital infrastructure as a part of its long-term goal to optimize the overall economic layout.  As part of the digital information infrastructure, the number of 5G base stations in the country increased by 81,000 during the first quarter of the year, bringing the total to over 1.5 million.  In the country's latest steps to ride the digitalization wave amid a surge of demand for computing capacity, China initiated works earlier this year on a mega project to establish eight national computing hubs and 10 national data center clusters in a bid to improve overall computing power and resource efficiency.  "Computing power has already become an important infrastructure for the national economic development," the NDRC stated on its website, estimating China's demand for computing power to surge by over 20 percent annually in the coming years.  As the Chinese economy enters into its critical stage of transformation and upgrading, a modern infrastructure system with a focus on shoring up weak links and fostering new growth drivers will lay a solid foundation for the country's medium and long-term development, said Fan Ruoying, a researcher with the Bank of China.  Looking ahead, efforts should be made to improve cross-regional and cross-department coordination in organizing infrastructure investment, lift restrictions on market access for private enterprises, and further innovate investment and financing methods, Fan noted.

President Xi Jinping quoted this line from an ancient Chinese poem to encourage young Chinese to strive for progress.  The poem was written by Fan Peng, a Chinese poet in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, cited the line while addressing a ceremony held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) on Tuesday.  Speaking at the ceremony on Tuesday, Xi called on CYLC members to be models of hard work and dedication, take the lead in remaining committed to standing on the side of the people, and be realistic, pragmatic, and down-to-earth.  Realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a relay race of history in which today's young people should strive for excellent performance, said Xi, adding that the times have always endowed young people with historical responsibilities.  "We believe a nation will be strong only when its young people are strong and a nation will make progress only when its younger generations make progress," said Xi. "We have always believed that the future of our nation rests on youths."  The CYLC was founded on May 5, 1922, under the direct leadership of the CPC. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Xi shared her story during a speech at a meeting of the United Nations (UN) in 2020, expressing his admiration for medical workers, including nurses.  Liu was among the 40,000-plus health workers from across the country who rushed to the central province of Hubei in 2020 when it was fighting a fierce battle against the COVID-19 epidemic.  "The moment I put on the protective suit, I am not a kid anymore." -- Xi cited Liu's words from a TV interview when she was told by a journalist that she is still very young, and needs to be taken care of.  "Those words moved the whole nation," Xi said while sharing Liu's story at the meeting marking the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.  Coming from the city of Huizhou, Guangdong Province, about 1,000 km south of Hubei's capital Wuhan, Liu was the youngest member of the medical-assistance team dispatched by the province to assist with Wuhan's fight against the novel coronavirus.  She volunteered to join the team during the Lantern Festival in February 2020. It was the furthest distance she had ever traveled from home, and the month she spent there was the longest time she had ever been away from her parents.  At the UN meeting, Xi spoke highly of Liu and medical workers like her, saying "their courage and hard work have shown the very best of the medical profession" and "their devotion and sacrifice have kept the nation intact through difficult times."  At a time when multiple Chinese cities are battling a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, a large number of nurses again threw themselves into the battle without hesitation.  "They proved worthy of the great trust placed in them," as Xi rightly said in his greetings to nurses in 2020 ahead of International Nurses Day, which falls on May 12.  The number of registered nurses in China had reached 5.02 million at the end of 2021, and there were about 3.56 nurses for every 1,000 people, according to official statistics.  Xi hailed them for exemplifying the noble spirit of respecting and protecting life, healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, and being dedicated to the cause, and asked governments at all levels to care about nurses, focus more efforts on strengthening the nursing workforce, and improve the incentive mechanisms.  Nursing is an important part of health care, Xi noted, calling on all members of society to show their appreciation and support for nurses. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"Rights and freedoms" are not shields for illegal activities in Hong Kong, and the office urged external forces to immediately stop the botched political performances rife with ideological prejudices, said a spokesperson for the office.  Hong Kong is administered by the rule of law where laws must be observed and lawbreakers held accountable, and no one shall be above the law, the spokesperson said.  "It is a globally accepted principle that those who violate laws shall be held to justice regardless of their background or identity," the spokesperson said.  The Hong Kong police, in accordance with their statutory functions and powers and legal procedures, investigated and arrested those suspected of engaging in activities that endanger national security, which are legitimate and necessary actions to safeguard national security as well as the rule of law and justice in the HKSAR, and brook no interference, the spokesperson said.  The spokesperson pointed out that since the implementation of the national security law in the HKSAR, China's security has been better protected, the Hong Kong society has been more stable, and the public has enjoyed a stronger sense of security.  For a long time, some outside actors, under the pretext of "democracy", "the rule of law", "human rights" and "freedom", have grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs and played the "Hong Kong card" to curb China's development, according to the spokesperson.  People around the world have seen through their tricks and hypocrisy, the spokesperson said, adding that hysteria of the external forces has further exposed their anger and anxiety when they saw the "political agents" they supported faced legal consequences.  The spokesperson stressed that those who take a wrong path have no future.  "Vilification of external forces cannot stop the historical trend of Hong Kong's transition from chaos to stability and prosperity, cannot change the bright prospects of Hong Kong's development, and cannot prevent China from achieving great national rejuvenation," the spokesperson said.  The office urged relevant countries and politicians to follow the historical trend, stop slandering the national security law and law enforcement actions of the HKSAR, refrain from interfering in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs, and no longer go down the path leading nowhere.

President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered an important speech.  He stressed that youth gives rise to infinite hope and young people are the creators of a bright future. For the younger generations in the new era, the time could not be better for them to complete weighty tasks since they have an incomparably broad stage to display their talents and brighter prospects than ever before to realize their dreams. Realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a relay race of history in which today's young people should strive to deliver their best performance.  President Xi called on the League to focus on the fundamental task of preparing the youth to contribute to and carry forward the socialist cause. The League should nourish the youth for the Party, take on its responsibilities, bear in mind the interests of the youth, and have the courage to reform itself.  He hopes that the League will unite and help its members and young people grow into new-era exemplary youths who have ideals, dare to assume responsibility, and are hardworking and able to endure hardship, so that they will build up the momentum for national rejuvenation with their youthful energy and creativity and build a better China with their youthful ingenuity and effort.  Other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also attended the event. They are Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng.  The atmosphere was solemn and warm in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People. A streamer bearing the words "Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Youth League of China" hung above the podium. In the middle of the curtain behind was the emblem of the Communist Youth League of China, with a sign reading "1922-2022" below and five red flags on each side.  The ceremony began at 10:00 a.m. All rose and sang the national anthem.  After enthusiastic applause, Xi Jinping delivered a speech.  He started by extending warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all League members as well as Communist Youth League organizations and staff at all levels on behalf of the CPC Central Committee.  Since the day of its founding, the Party has paid particular attention to the youth and placed the hopes of China's revolution on them, Xi noted.  Over the past century, under the Party's strong leadership, the League has stayed true to its original aspiration and founding mission, organized and guided generation after generation of young people to stay firm in their convictions and loyal to the Party, fight for national independence and the people's liberation, and contribute to the country's strength and prosperity and the happiness of the people. Through these efforts, a stirring chapter of youth was written on China's path toward national rejuvenation.  Over the past century, the Communist Youth League has been of one heart and mind with the Party and followed in its footsteps, he said. It has united and led League members and young people in dedicating themselves to the cause of the Party and the people, devoting their youth to the journey toward national rejuvenation, and thus engraving their glory in the annals of history. Both history and reality tell us that the Communist Youth League of China is worthy of being regarded as the vanguard of the Chinese youth movement, a loyal aide to the Party, and a reliable reserve force.  Over the past century, with firm ideals and strong will, the Communist Youth League has amassed valuable experience, Xi stressed. The 100-year history of the League has defined that upholding Party leadership is crucial to its success, and instilled its political essence of having firm ideals and convictions. The century-long history has also helped build up the League's strength for contributing to national rejuvenation, and identified taking root among young people as its source of vitality. Such important experience should be drawn upon to make new achievements in the future.  Xi pointed out that on the new journey ahead, how to better unite, organize, and mobilize young people in China's efforts to achieve the Second Centenary Goal and realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a major topic that needs to be addressed in the Chinese youth movement and work related to youths in the new era.  He shared his hopes for the League in four aspects.  First, he hopes that the League would nourish the youth for the Party and remain a political school that leads the political advancement of the Chinese youth. The League should be politically-minded, start with ways of thinking, and take into consideration the characteristics of the youth in helping them set lofty goals at an early age, and in fostering their trust for the Party, confidence in socialism with Chinese characteristics and belief in Marxism from the bottom of their heart. The League should be guided by the vitally important goal of making sure that the cause of the Party is carried forward by future generations, and focus on the fundamental task of preparing the youth to contribute to and carry forward the socialist cause. It should help the youth become more proud, confident, and assured in their identity as Chinese people through tempering both in thinking and practice.  Second, he hopes the League would take up its responsibilities and remain a vanguard in organizing the Chinese youth to keep going forward. The League should unite and lead its members and young people in heeding the call of the Party and the people, bearing in mind the country's most fundamental interests, shouldering their missions, and realizing their aspirations and making achievements in new fronts in the new era. The League should encourage its members and young people to pursue the great ideal and drive forward the great cause.  Third, he hopes the League would bear in mind the interests of the youth and remain the strongest bond between the Party and the youth. The League should uphold the lifeline of serving the youth, carry out its political duty of consolidating and expanding the support from the youth for the Party's governance, and make every effort to benefit the youth, solve their difficulties, think from their perspective, respond to their concerns, and offer the youth tangible support.  Fourth, he hopes the League should have the courage to reform itself and remain an advanced organization that closely follows the Party and stays at the forefront of the times. The League should ensure the overall leadership of the Party throughout the whole process of its work in all areas, follow the Chinese socialist development path of people's organizations, and deepen its reform. The League should develop a keen understanding of the youth and, in light of the new changes and features of young people's work and life styles, explore new approaches and models for its primary-level organizations, lead youth and student federations in promoting patriotism and socialism and constantly consolidate and expand the patriotic united front among the youth. The League should also use the Party's experience and effective practices in strict Party self-governance to improve itself with the spirit of reform and innovation and in a strict and practical manner, and at the same time exercise rigorous self-governance. Through comprehensive and high-standard self-improvement, the Communist Youth League will take on a positive image that reflects the spirit of the times.  Striving for progress is the most precious character of youths, and it is also what is most expected of them by the Party and the people, Xi stressed.  League members in the new era should be role models of upholding lofty ideals and firm beliefs, take the lead in studying Marxist theory, build the ideal of communism and a shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, conscientiously practice core socialist values, and fully promote patriotism, he said.  They are expected to play an exemplary role by studying hard and boldly engaging in innovation, take the requirements of their jobs as the starting point to improve their capabilities and strive for excellence, and try their best to become backbone personnel and advanced youths.  They should be both brave and adept in carrying out our struggle, lead the way in rising to challenges and tackling tough problems, and refuse to be taken in by fallacies or to tremble in the face of danger.  They should be models of hard work and dedication, take the lead in remaining committed to standing on the side of the people, be realistic, pragmatic, and down-to-earth, be the first to suffer hardship and the last to enjoy comfort, and be willing to play a minor but forever effective role in their posts.  They should set an example in acting in a good and virtuous manner and in observing a strict code of discipline, uphold public and personal morals, abide by disciplinary regulations and the law, and strictly fulfill their obligations as League members.  All League members should receive political training, intensify political tempering, and strive for political advancement. On this basis, they should actively draw closer to the Party, set it as their goal to become a qualified Party member, and take pride in achieving it.  League staff must refine their political character of being loyal to the Party and champion the spirit of pursuing noble ideals, Xi said.  They must consciously practice the mass line and firmly establish a correct mass viewpoint, maintain close ties with youths, be friends instead of "bureaucrats" to youths, and work to better benefit youths rather than themselves.  They must develop a work style of being responsible and practical, refrain from empty talk to do more pragmatic work, have the courage to bear hardships, take on difficult tasks, shoulder heavy responsibilities, and face risks under harsh environments and at the community level, and conduct themselves properly and do solid work.  They must improve moral cultivation to remain honest and self-disciplined, hold regulations and the law in awe and speak and act prudently, constantly build up their willpower, perseverance, and self-control, and be persons who always bear the public good in mind, have a strong sense of righteousness, and remain untainted by malpractices.  On the quest to realize national rejuvenation, the Communist Party of China is the vanguard, the Communist Youth League is the spearhead, and the Young Pioneers is the reserve force, Xi said, adding that joining the Pioneers, the League, and then the Party makes up the "trilogy of life" for youths seeking political advancement.  The League should perform its political duty of guiding the Young Pioneers, standardize and strengthen mechanisms for the Young Pioneers recommending outstanding members to the Youth League and from the Youth League to the Party, and work hard to improve the interconnection and coordination between personnel cultivation in the Young Pioneers, the Youth League, and the Party.  Party organizations at all levels must attach great importance to the training and recruitment of outstanding young people and should, particularly, focus on cultivating and admitting outstanding Youth League members into the Party, so as to ensure our socialist country never changes its nature.  Party committees and Party leadership groups at all levels must study the laws governing youths' growth and their contemporary features with great enthusiasm, devote great energy to the work related to youths, and serve wholeheartedly as their confidant and their guide, Xi noted.  Party organizations at all levels must implement the systems and mechanisms for using Party building to lead League building, study and resolve major issues regarding League work on a regular basis, care about and expect more of League staff, and support the League in creatively carrying out their initiatives in accordance with the features of and the laws governing the work on people's organizations.  For the Party and the country, young people deserve the best protection and bear our highest expectations, Xi stressed.  "They are like the young trees thriving on earth that will eventually grow into towering trees to provide shelter for those in need. They are like the rising sun whose energy keeps on increasing as it climbs up the sky until the moment when it lights and warms up the earth," he said. "The Party and the country place their hopes on the youth."  Presiding over the ceremony, Wang Huning said the important speech delivered by President Xi comprehensively reviewed the 100-year history of the League's unswerving adherence to the instructions and guidance of the Party, and fully recognized that the League, under the Party's leadership, has united and led generations of League members and young people in making significant contributions to realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.  The speech has elucidated the historical experience of the League and youth work, while setting clear requirements for the League's work in the new era, Wang said.  The speech holds significant political, theoretical, and strategic value and is a sound source of guidance, and we should conscientiously study and understand it, and thoroughly implement it, he said.  He Junke, first secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, and Chen Gang, first secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the ceremony.  Members of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, as well as leading members of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Central Military Commission attended the ceremony.  The event was also attended by about 1,000 people, including leading officials from various departments of the CPC Central Committee, the government, the military and mass organizations, representatives of League members and young people from all walks of life in Beijing and diplomatic envoys from some countries to China.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Youth League of China  May 10, 2022  Xi Jinping  Members of the Communist Youth League of China (League), young friends, and comrades,  Youth gives rise to infinite hope, and young people are the creators of a bright future. A nation can thrive and prosper only when it places hopes on its youth and maintains its youthful vigor.  Today, we are gathered here at the ceremony marking the centenary of the Communist Youth League of China to encourage League members and young people to forge ahead on the new journey toward realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.  First of all, on behalf of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, I would like to extend warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all League members as well as Communist Youth League organizations and staff at all levels.  League members, young friends, and comrades,  The Chinese nation is an ancient nation with a long, enduring history and has experienced many years of vicissitudes. More importantly, it is also a youthful nation that continuously pursues self-improvement and remains vibrant. With a civilization of over 5,000 years, our nation has long cherished the traditional belief that heroes are cultivated from young age and embraces the idea that the waves behind drive on those ahead. We believe a nation will be strong only when its young people are strong and a nation will make progress only when its younger generations make progress. We have always believed that the future of our nation rest on youths. For hundreds of years, the strength, vitality, and creativity of the youth have always been a mighty force that drives our nation forward against all challenges and enables it to stand tall among the nations of the world.  The destiny of the youth is always closely connected with the times. After the Opium War of 1840, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and suffered greater ravages than ever before. The country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese civilization was plunged into darkness. Many noble-minded patriots sought to pull the nation together. Many progressive young people were enlightened at this "Awakening Age." The great May Fourth Movement promoted the spread of Marxism in China, ushered in the new-democratic revolution, and marked the beginning of the youth's role as the pioneers advancing social changes in China.  With the youth awakened and advanced ideas disseminated, the dynamic revolution quickly swept across the vast land of China. As Marxism-Leninism was becoming closely integrated with the Chinese workers' movement, the Communist Party of China was born. Since the day of its founding, the Party has paid particular attention to the youth and placed the hopes of revolution on them. At its First National Congress, the Party carried out specific studies into the establishment and development of a youth league as the prep school for the Party. On May 5, 1922, the Communist Youth League of China was founded under the direct care and leadership of the CPC, marking a milestone in the history of China's revolution and youth movement.  Faithfully following the Party and working for the Party and the people constitute the Communist Youth League's original aspiration and founding mission, to which the League has stayed true over the past century. Under the Party's strong leadership, it has organized and guided generation after generation of young people to stay firm in their convictions and loyal to the Party, fight for national independence and the people's liberation, and contribute to the country's strength and prosperity and the happiness of the people. Through these efforts, a stirring chapter of youth was written on our path toward China's national rejuvenation.  In the period of the new-democratic revolution, the Communist Youth League actively engaged in promoting Marxism in China, enlightening young people with advanced ideas and rallying their force. Under the League's leadership, its members and young people devoted themselves to anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements of workers, peasants, and students, actively served in revolutionary armies led by the Party, and fought in the battles to bring down warlords, resist Japanese invaders, and overthrow the rule of the Kuomintang. They manifested a spirit of fighting bravely without fear of sacrifice. Charging forward through hailstorms of bullets, League members and young people showed their firm faith and passed the test of life and death, dedicating their youth to the victory of China's revolution and making outstanding contributions.  In the period of socialist revolution and construction, the Communist Youth League took an active part in the most extensive and profound social reform in the Chinese history. Its members acted as the spearhead in various campaigns and they were organized to reclaim uncultivated land, educate the illiterate, and learn from the model soldier Lei Feng. Under the League's leadership, its members and young people were empowered by the spirit of "daring to make the sun and the moon shine in the new sky" and shouted out the slogan of "devoting our youth to the motherland." They rose to all sorts of challenges, no matter in scientific researches or the harsh natural environment. They manifested a spirit of daring to struggle and working hard. Pulling through hardships and dangers, League members and young people took the initiative to shoulder responsibilities and braved themselves in the most challenging and demanding missions, dedicating their youth to the country's construction and making outstanding contributions.  In the new period of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, the Communist Youth League adjusted itself to the strategic shift in the focus of the Party and the country's work, freed the mind, and forged ahead with resolve. It launched a large number of creative initiatives, encouraging young people to be "pacesetters of the New Long March," to uphold "five things to stress," "four things to beautify," and "three things to love," to join the Project Hope for children's education in rural areas, to serve as volunteers, to perfect their professional performances, and to work for the environmental project "Mother River Protection." Under the League's leadership, a call of the time that "let us unite for national rejuvenation" resonated, and League members and young people rode the waves on all fronts of modernization. They manifested a spirit of daring to explore and setting the trend. Engaging themselves in the modernization drive by destroying the old and establishing the new, League members and young people acted as trailblazers of reform and led the way ahead, dedicating their youth to the country's reform and opening up and socialist modernization and making outstanding contributions.  In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Communist Youth League has pursued a great struggle, a great project, a great cause, and a great dream, made innovation on the basis of what has worked in the past, advanced its work with full strength, and reformed itself comprehensively. Under the League's leadership, its members and young people did their best in the fight against poverty, in cutting-edge scientific researches, in disaster rescue and relief missions, on the epidemic response frontline, in the Olympic arena, and at posts of defending the motherland, stepping up and responding to the calls of the Party and the people when they were most needed. They have manifested a spirit of self-confidence, self-reliance, vigor, and action. "My pure love is only for China," a phrase written by a young soldier and martyr, has become the most powerful expression of young people in contemporary China. Bearing a great dream and a great mission, League members and young people have willingly carried the ball on the frontline and demonstrated their brilliance in the course of realizing national rejuvenation, dedicating their youth to historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country and making outstanding contributions.  Although the times keep changing, young people in China have been committed to the same mission. Over the past century, the Communist Youth League has been of one heart and mind with the Party and followed in its footsteps. It has united and led League members and young people in dedicating themselves to the cause of the Party and the people, devoting their youth to the journey toward national rejuvenation, and thus engraving their glory in the annals of history.  Both history and reality tell us that the Communist Youth League of China is worthy of being regarded as the vanguard of the Chinese youth movement, a loyal aide to the Party, and a reliable reserve force.  League members, young friends, and comrades,  The further we advance and the higher we climb, the better we should be at absorbing wisdom from our past experience, boosting our confidence, and improving our strength. Over the past century, with firm ideals and strong will, the Communist Youth League has amassed valuable experience which should be drawn upon to make new achievements in the future.  The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has defined that upholding Party leadership is crucial to the League's success.  The Communist Youth League would not have taken shape without the Communist Party of China. Since the very first day it was founded, the League has shared the same banner, will, and mission with the Party, integrated upholding the leadership of the Party into its lifeblood, and developed its particular character and distinct advantage which differentiate it from other youth organizations. Following the instructions and guidance of the Party remains the political career of the League, and that the League will act upon the Party's call is the political belief of League members from generation to generation. History has proved that only if it upholds Party leadership can the Communist Youth League unite the youth and lead them in moving forward and ensure that the Chinese youth movement is advancing in the right political direction.  The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has instilled its political essence of having firm ideals and convictions.  Inspired by ideals and convictions, the Communist Youth League has organized and united young people with firm belief and scientific thinking. The first national congress of the League defined building a communist society as its ultimate ideal and made clear its banner of socialism, which has lighted the beacon of ideals and convictions among generations of young people. This is the most fundamental and enduring cohesion of the League. History tells us that only by holding high the banner of communism and socialism, can the Communist Youth League form the most solid unity, forge the most effective organization, and ensure that the youth are united under the banner of the Party's ideals and convictions.  The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has helped build up its strength for contributing to national rejuvenation.  The Party's goal determines the orientation of the Communist Youth League's action. Focusing on the Party's key tasks in different stages of history, the League has united and led its members and youths in joining the people in practice. It has served as pioneers in efforts toward national rejuvenation and played their role as a fresh driving force and the spearhead, ensuring that the goal of achieving national rejuvenation become the main theme throughout the Chinese youth movement. History has fully demonstrated that only by centering on endeavoring for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, can the Communist Youth League unite as many young people as possible to write an epic chapter of youth.  The 100-year history of the Communist Youth League has identified taking root among young people as its source of vitality.  The Communist Youth League is glowing with youth and vigor after a hundred years of vicissitudes because it has consistently taken root among young people, put its focus of work on the overwhelming majority of young workers and peasants and ordinary youths, and stood with the youth while building a bridge to bring young people closer to the Party. History has shown that only by drawing nourishment and strength from the fertile soil of the vast number of young people, can the Communist Youth League be a close friend to youths that is trustworthy, reliable, and inseparable.  League members, young friends, and comrades,  Under the strong leadership of the Party, people of all ethnic groups in China have united as one with a shared purpose, have fulfilled the First Centenary Goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and are moving on toward the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects.  Realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a relay race of history in which today's young people should strive for excellent performance. The times have always endowed young people with historical responsibilities. For generations of youths in the new era, the time could not be better for them to complete weighty tasks since they have an incomparably broad stage to display their talents and brighter prospects than ever before to realize their dreams. At the ceremony marking the centenary of the Communist Party of China, representatives from the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers declared the commitment of making due contribution to building a strong country. This is what Chinese youths are supposed to do in the new era and what the Party's youth organizations must be committed to.  On the new journey ahead, how to better unite, organize, and mobilize young people in China's efforts to achieve the Second Centenary Goal and realize the Chinese Dream is a major topic that needs to be addressed in the Chinese youth movement and work related to youths in the new era. The Communist Youth League must enhance its leadership, organization, and services, unite and help its members and young people grow into new-era exemplary youths who have ideals, dare to assume responsibility, and are hardworking and able to endure hardship. In this way, they will build up the momentum for national rejuvenation with their youthful energy and creativity and build a better China with their youthful ingenuity and effort.  Here I would like to share a few of my hopes with the League.  First, I hope the League would nourish the youth for the Party and remain a political school that leads the political advancement of the Chinese youth. Only those aim high would scale the heights and look afar, and only those with a global vision would achieve great success. The passion of youth should be accompanied by firm ideals and convictions. By including the word "communist" into the League's name, the Party hopes that this youth organization would always stand on the high ground of ideals and convictions, equip the youth with the Party's theories, inspire them with the Party's original aspiration and founding mission, guide them with the Party's glorious banner, and shape them with the Party's fine conduct. The youth of China in the new era are more confident and capable of self-improvement, and they think more critically. At the same time, they are facing the influence of various trends of thought and would inevitably get confused about matters such as ideals and reality, doctrines and issues, egoism and altruism, individual and collective identities, and the nation and the world. More meticulous education and guidance is needed to help them make social observations with a sharp eye, think about life with a sober mind, and create the future with wisdom.  As a school for the young people to study socialism with Chinese characteristics and communism through practice, the Communist Youth League should be politically-minded, start with ways of thinking, and take into consideration the characteristics of the youth in helping them set lofty goals at an early age, and in fostering their trust for the Party, confidence in socialism with Chinese characteristics and belief in Marxism from the bottom of their hearts. The League should be guided by the vitally important goal of making sure that the cause of the Party is carried forward by future generations, and focus on the fundamental task of preparing the youth to contribute to and carry forward the socialist cause. It should help the youth become more proud, confident, and assured in their identity as Chinese people through tempering both in thinking and practice, so that the cause of the Party will be carried on from generation to generation.  Second, I hope the League would take up its responsibilities and remain a vanguard in organizing the Chinese youth to keep going forward. Working hard is the brightest color of youth, and taking actions is the best trial for young people. Responsibilities and commitment are what make the youthful years shine. The youth are always pioneers who are most passionate about innovation and most motivated to innovate. The cause of the Party and the people would not be advanced without the endeavor and dedication of generations of young aspirants. Only when youth fully aligns with the cause of the Party and the people, can its spectrum be broadened and energy fully stimulated. Young people are the most vigorous, enterprising, and least conservative group in society, who possess infinite power to improve the objective world and promote social progress. The Communist Youth League should unite and lead its members and young people in catching the contemporary waves, heeding the call of the Party and the people, bearing in mind the country's most fundamental interests, shouldering their missions, and realizing their aspirations and making achievements in new fronts in the new era. The League should encourage its members and young people to pursue the great ideal, drive forward the great cause, and let their youth blossom in fields where the Party and the people need them most.  Thirdly, I hope the League would bear in mind the interests of the youth and remain the strongest bond between the Party and the youth. The Communist Youth League is a people's organization under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, as well as the youth's own organization. The greatest strength of the League lies in its network at the primary level that allows the League to stay close to the youth. The League should uphold the lifeline of serving the youth and carry out its political duty of consolidating and expanding the support from the youth for the Party's governance. While letting the Party know about the wellbeing of the youth, the League should also fully pass on the Party's care to the youth. The League should make every effort to benefit the youth, solve their difficulties, think from their perspective, respond to their concerns, and make full use of the resources and channels provided by the Party to offer the youth tangible support. In this way, young people would genuinely feel that the Party is always close by and ready to attend to their needs.  Fourthly, the League should have the courage to reform itself and remain an advanced organization that closely follows the Party and stays at the forefront of the times. For the Communist Youth League, what kind of youth organization it should develop itself into and how to build it are major questions of fundamental importance. "A fixed system is not capable of responding to infinite changes, one road would not lead to myriad destinations, and a lost sword would hardly be located in a river by leaving a mark on the boat." Only through bold self-reform can the League keep pace with the times, the youth's development, and the trend of practice and innovation.  The Communist Youth League should ensure the overall leadership of the Party throughout the whole process of its work in all areas, follow the Chinese socialist development path of people's organizations, focus on the goal and direction of maintaining and strengthening its political character, pioneering nature, and connection with the people, and deepen its reform. The League should develop a keen understanding of the youth and, in light of the new changes and features of young people's work and life styles, explore new approaches and models for its primary-level organizations. It should lead youth and student federations in promoting patriotism and socialism and constantly consolidate and expand the patriotic united front among the youth. The League should also use the Party's experience and effective practices in strict Party self-governance to improve itself with the spirit of reform and innovation and in a strict and practical manner, and at the same time exercise rigorous self-governance. Through comprehensive and high-standard self-improvement, the Communist Youth League will take on a positive image that reflects the spirit of the times.  As a line in an old Chinese poem goes, "Everything in life must be experienced by oneself; it is the minor steps that take one to a wider world." Striving for progress is the most precious character of the youth, and it is also what is most expected of them by our Party and people. League members in the new era should be role models of upholding lofty ideals and firm beliefs, take the lead in studying Marxist theory, build the ideal of communism and a shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, conscientiously practice core socialist values, and fully promote patriotism. They should play an exemplary role by studying hard and boldly engaging in innovation, take the requirements of their jobs as the starting point to improve their capabilities and strive for excellence, and try their best to become backbone personnel and advanced youths. They should be both brave and adept in carrying out our struggle, lead the way in rising to challenges and tackling tough problems, and refuse to be taken in by fallacies or to tremble in the face of danger. They should be models of hard work and dedication, take the lead in remaining committed to standing on the side of the people, be realistic, pragmatic, and down-to-earth, be the first to suffer hardship and the last to enjoy comfort, and be willing to play a minor but forever effective role in their posts. They should set an example in acting in a good and virtuous manner and in observing a strict code of discipline, uphold public and personal morals, abide by disciplinary regulations and the law, and strictly fulfill their obligations as members of the Communist Youth League. All League members should receive political training, intensify political tempering, and strive for political advancement. On this basis, they should actively draw closer to the Party, set it as their goal to become a qualified Party member, and take pride in achieving it.  For many years, the staff of the Communist Youth League have carried forward their fine traditions, diligently performed their duties, and thus made significant contributions to the Party's work related to youths. League staff must refine their political character of being loyal to the Party, champion the spirit of pursuing noble ideals, and remain clear-minded and strong-hearted so that they make people feel the lucidness and pureness of young officials at first sight. They must consciously practice the mass line and firmly establish a correct mass viewpoint, maintain close ties with youths, be friends instead of "bureaucrats" to youths, and work to better benefit youths rather than themselves. They must develop a work style of being responsible and practical, refrain from empty talk to do more pragmatic work, have the courage to bear hardships, take on difficult tasks, shoulder heavy responsibilities, and face risks under harsh environments and at the community level, and conduct themselves properly and do solid work. They must improve moral cultivation to remain honest and self-disciplined, hold regulations and the law in awe and speak and act prudently, constantly build up their willpower, perseverance, and self-control, and be persons who always bear the public good in mind, have a strong sense of righteousness, and remain untainted by malpractices.  League members, young friends, and comrades,  Revolutionaries are always young. Today, a hundred years on from its founding, the Communist Party of China is still in its prime, and remains as determined as ever to achieve lasting greatness for the Chinese nation. Quoting from Engels, Lenin once said, "We are the party of the future, and the future belongs to the youth. We are a party of innovators, and it is always the youth that most eagerly follows the innovators. We are a party that is waging a self-sacrificing struggle against the old rottenness, and youth is always the first to undertake a self-sacrificing struggle." Both history and reality have shown that the Communist Party of China is a party that always preserves its youthful features and a party that is worthy of the young people's trust and worth following.  On the quest to realize national rejuvenation, the Communist Party of China is the vanguard, the Communist Youth League is the spearhead, and the Young Pioneers is the reserve force. Joining the Pioneers, the League, and then the Party makes up the "trilogy of life" for youths seeking political advancement. The Party has kept its gate open to all young people and will continue to welcome more youths who will add new blood to the Party. The Communist Youth League must perform its political duty of guiding the Young Pioneers, standardize and strengthen mechanisms for the Young Pioneers recommending outstanding members to the Youth League and from the League to the Party, and work hard to improve the interconnection and coordination between personnel cultivation in the Young Pioneers, the League, and the Party. Party organizations at all levels must attach great importance to the training and recruitment of outstanding young people and should, particularly, focus on cultivating and admitting outstanding League members into the Party, so as to ensure our socialist country never changes its nature.  Li Dazhao, a Chinese communist, once said, "The youth are the soul of a country." The Party's work related to young people was, is, and will be of strategic importance. Party committees and Party leadership groups at all levels must study the laws governing youths' growth and their contemporary features with great enthusiasm, devote great energy to the work related to youths, and serve wholeheartedly as their confidant and their guide. Party organizations at all levels must implement the systems and mechanisms for using Party building to lead League building, study and resolve major issues regarding League work on a regular basis, care about and expect more of League staff, and support the League in creatively carrying out their initiatives in accordance with the features of and the laws governing the work on people's organizations.  League members, young friends, and comrades,  More than 2,000 years ago, Confucius said, "A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do you know that his future will not be equal to our present?" For the Party and the country, young people deserve the best protection and bear our highest expectations. They are like the young trees thriving on earth that will eventually grow into towering trees to provide shelter for those in need. They are like the rising sun whose energy keeps on increasing as it climbs up the sky until the moment when it lights and warms up the earth. The Party and the country place their hopes on the youth.  As the Northern Shaanxi College was set up in 1937, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the inscription "We need to cultivate a large number of personnel who will become the vanguard of China's revolution. They are politically far-sighted and full of the spirit of struggle and self-sacrifice. They have largeness of mind and are loyal, active, and upright. They do not pursue any personal gain, but work for the sole purpose of national and social liberation. They always meet difficulty head-on with resolve and brave persistence. They are neither swaggerers nor people who seek the limelight, but rather practical people who keep their feet firmly on the ground. Once our country has a large number of such vanguard, the task of China's revolution will be carried out successfully." In present-day China, the Party and the people still need a large number of such vanguard, and the Party Central Committee earnestly hopes the Communist Youth League can deliver results in this regard. This is the ardent expectation of the Party as well as our motherland and people.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The younger generation, according to Xi, should do their best to help realize national rejuvenation -- the greatest dream of the Chinese people since the Opium War of 1840.  Overseas Chinese youth said that they will carry forward their dreams and missions, and forge ahead on the new journey to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.  Lan Tianzhang, deputy captain of the political work of the 20th Chinese peacekeeping engineering detachment to Lebanon, said the young peacekeepers in Lebanon have been taking concrete actions to fulfill their missions and safeguard world peace, adding that they will work hard to make more contributions to realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  Wang Xiaowei, manager of the fifth site office of the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway invested by the China Road and Bridge Corporation, said they, as young workers serving the Belt and Road Initiative, feel proud of their mission and are more aware of the responsibilities of the young generation, adding that they will take roots in the frontline to ensure that the project becomes a high-quality one.  Wang Yuqing, a Chinese teacher at the Confucius Institute at the University of Karachi in Pakistan, said that Xi's words greatly encouraged young teachers working at overseas Confucius Institutes and gave them the confidence to do a better job of telling China's stories.  Miao Danying, a lecturer at the United Nations Visitors Service at Nairobi, said that an increasing number of Chinese people are serving in the United Nations and young faces are constantly emerging, showcasing Chinese culture and contributing Chinese talent in different positions.  Miao believed that with the continuous development of China, the prospects for Chinese youth to realize their dreams will be even broader.  Xia Yang, president of the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars in Japan, said that they must study hard and return home as soon as possible to contribute to China's development and prosperity as well as the rejuvenation of the nation.  Li Feng, who is about to finish his studies at the University of Zagreb in Croatia soon and return to China, pledged to be a young person with lofty ideals and firm convictions, and contribute to the development and prosperity of the country.

Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, noted that the World Health Organization is a body of the United Nations that only sovereign nations can join. The Taiwan region, as part of China, has never had the right to be a member.  Taiwan's participation in WHO activities must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle, said Zhu. She said that the DPP authority has undermined the political foundation for cross-Strait consultation by clutching to its successionist agenda of "Taiwan independence," as well as twisting and denying the 1992 Consensus.  By doing so, the DPP authority has diminished the political foundation for Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly, added Zhu. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Wang, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, made the remarks in a congratulatory letter sent to the fifth cross-Strait youth development forum which was held in the city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, on Wednesday.  Wang, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said the forum, which has been held for five years in a row overcoming all sorts of negative factors, has shown the strong desire across the Taiwan Strait for strengthening exchanges and cooperation.  Wang said the Chinese mainland welcomes more Taiwan youth to come over to chase their dreams here and stands ready to create more favorable conditions for cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation.  He said the situation across the Taiwan Strait faces increasing uncertainties and instabilities, and "Taiwan independence" elements remain the biggest threat to a better life for compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.  But national reunification and national rejuvenation are an unstoppable process, he added, noting that young people are the future of the country and the Chinese nation and they shoulder the heavy responsibility of working for the greater good of the nation and devoting themselves to national rejuvenation.  Wang said he hopes that young people in Taiwan will firmly oppose "Taiwan independence" secessionists and external interference, and make more contributions to advancing the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, the reunification of the motherland and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  The forum was attended by Hung Hsiu-chu, former chairperson of the Chinese Kuomintang party, as well as about 450 representatives from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  * Founded in 1922, the CYLC has proven itself to be the vanguard of the Chinese youth movement, Xi said.  * Xi told the League to always serve as the strongest "bridge" and "bond" that connect the Party and Chinese youth.  * League members should be patriotic and innovative, while not being misguided or intimidated by difficulties, Xi said.  BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday hailed the contributions made by young communists over the past century, and called on them to offer energy and creativity to push forward national rejuvenation.  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while addressing a ceremony held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC).  Founded in 1922, the CYLC has closely followed the Party's lead and written a "youthful chapter" in the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Xi said.  The ceremony, broadcast from the Great Hall of the People to a national audience, was presided over by Wang Huning, and attended by Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng. All of them are members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.  The CYLC had more than 73.71 million members by the end of 2021.  Speaking at the ceremony, He Junke, first secretary of the Secretariat of the CYLC Central Committee, attributed the robust vitality of Chinese youth in the new era to the leadership of the Party.  Young people must play a vanguard role and closely follow the Party, He said.  IMPORTANT FEATS  In his speech, Xi enumerated the contributions made by CYLC members in the past 100 years.  League members have accomplished important feats in the victory of the Chinese revolution, the development of the motherland, reform and opening up and socialist modernization, as well as in securing historic achievements and shifts in the cause of the Party and the country in the new era, Xi said.  The CYLC has proven itself to be the vanguard of the Chinese youth movement, he noted.  Using past experience as an outline for the CYLC in the future, Xi said the League achieved success because it upheld the leadership of the Party, reinforced faith in communism and socialism, committed itself to national rejuvenation, and remained rooted in Chinese youth.  Chinese youth in the new era, blessed with a spacious and promising platform, should also shoulder important responsibilities, Xi said.  The pursuit of the Chinese Dream is a relay race, Xi said, adding that young Chinese today should strive to excel in contributing to national rejuvenation.

(Xinhua/Yue Yuewei)  PARTY'S "SCHOOL" AND "BRIDGE"  On his expectations for the CYLC, Xi said the League should educate young people for the Party and always serve as a political school guiding the ideological progress of young people.  The League should always be a vanguard force in mobilizing China's youth in continuous endeavor, he added.  Xi told the League to always serve as the strongest "bridge" and "bond" that connect the Party and Chinese youth, as well as to conduct self-reform.  League members must play exemplary roles in life and work, earnestly attend political training, and strive for the glorious goal of becoming qualified CPC members, Xi said, urging them to build up firm beliefs, and boost their courage and skills to carry out struggles.  They should also be patriotic and innovative, while not being misguided or intimidated by difficulties, he added.  Noting that the CPC is always worthy of trust and to be followed by young people, Xi said the Party always opens its door to young people and warmly welcomes them to become the new blood of the CPC.  "The Party and the country place our hopes on young people!" Xi said.

"This is an era when everyone has the opportunity to shine," Zou said after hearing Xi's speech.

The election of the sixth-term chief executive of the HKSAR was successfully held earlier on Sunday with John Lee elected as the chief executive designate by an overwhelming majority of votes in accordance with law.  People from all sectors in the HKSAR have expressed warm congratulations. However, acting against international law and the basic norms governing international relations, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and a few other foreign politicians slandered the electoral system of the HKSAR, the election result and the Chinese central government's policies towards Hong Kong, said a spokesperson of the office.  The spokesperson said the election is of great significance as this year marks the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the "one country, two systems" policy is entering a new period.  As a successful practice in developing democracy with Hong Kong characteristics, the election further implemented the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," showed higher superiority of the new electoral system, and ensured Hong Kong's moving from chaos to stability and prosperity, said the spokesperson.  The spokesperson pointed out that the election is fair and impartial and complies with laws and regulations, and the result testifies to the strong public support to Lee.  The election, held under the new electoral system, shows that Hong Kong's democracy is advancing with the times and is good for Hong Kong's long-term stability and development, said the spokesperson.  The spokesperson noted that over the past 25 years, the Chinese central government has fully and faithfully implemented the principles of "one country, two systems," "the people of Hong Kong administering Hong Kong," and a high degree of autonomy.  The central government has firmly safeguarded national sovereignty, security, development interests, and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the spokesperson said, adding it has also resolutely supported the development of democracy with Hong Kong characteristics and protected all the lawful rights and freedoms enjoyed by the Hong Kong residents.  Facts have proved that Hong Kong's new electoral system is an effective one in line with "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong's reality, according to the spokesperson.  Facts will also prove in the future that the new chief executive elected under the new electoral system will lead the new term of the HKSAR government and people from all walks of life to forge ahead at a new starting point, create a new situation of sound governance in Hong Kong, promote the coordinated development of Hong Kong in economic, political, social and cultural fields, and further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a global financial, trade and shipping center, the spokesperson said.  The spokesperson pointed out that some EU politicians, harboring the intention of using Hong Kong to contain China, confused black and white, and vilified the new electoral system and "one country, two systems."  Any slander of the election result and any interference in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs are "botched political performances that run counter to the global trend and selective blindness to Hong Kong's genuine public opinion," said the spokesperson.  The spokesperson stressed that Hong Kong is part of China and the election of the chief executive of the HKSAR is purely China's internal affair.  The office urged all the external forces who attempt to meddle with China's internal affairs, including some EU politicians, to recognize the historical trend, change course, reflect on themselves, ditch double standards, abide by international law and the basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs in any form.  "Otherwise they will only shoot themselves in the foot," the spokesperson said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The office expressed the view in an article released after John Lee won the election of the six-term chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) with an overwhelming majority of votes. It extended congratulations to Lee on winning the election.  The chief executive election represented another successful practice of the HKSAR's new electoral system after the Election Committee elections last September and the election of the seventh-term Legislative Council last December, the office said.  It has been proved by solid facts that the new system is a good one that follows the "one country, two systems" principle and is suited to Hong Kong's realities, the office said.  Facts will also prove that the newly elected chief executive will certainly lead the new team of the HKSAR government and people from all sectors of society to stay united and strive for new prospects of good governance in Hong Kong at a new starting point, it added.  SUCCESSFUL ELECTION WITH NEW LOOK  The election is the first HKSAR chief executive election held after Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order. It is of great significance and far-reaching influence and has drawn wide attention.  The office hailed Sunday's election a complete success, saying it was achieved with the joint efforts of the HKSAR government and all sectors of society by conducting the election in strict accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR, relevant decisions of the National People's Congress and its standing committee, and relevant electoral laws of the HKSAR, and by overcoming the impact of COVID-19.  "The election process was orderly, fair, safe, clean and with numerous highlights," it said.  The election has focused on development and people's well-being and brought together strong positive energy, said the office, noting that the goals and tenets of vision put forward by Lee in his announcement of his candidacy have aroused strong response and broad resonance in Hong Kong.  Recognizing the extensive and in-depth public participation in the election, the office said it fully demonstrates democracy. Since Lee announced his candidacy, he has made intensive visits to people from all walks of life, conducted online exchanges of views, and visited communities to extensively collect public opinions and introduce his election vision and manifesto.  It can be said that the process for Lee to form and introduce his election manifesto was a process of democratic consultation in Hong Kong society.  Lee has got wide support, the office said, noting that he was elected with 99.16 percent of the votes, which fully reflects the high recognition he gained in Hong Kong society.  It is widely believed that Lee, who was promoted from a front-line police officer to chief secretary for administration of the HKSAR government, has rich grassroots experience and strong enforcement ability. He has taken a firm stand and stood the test with courage and sense of responsibility in the process of stopping violence and chaos and implementing the law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR.  The general public in Hong Kong has full trust in and high expectations on Lee, believing that he can recruit talent to form a new administration team of the HKSAR government, achieve the goals with decisive administration, improve governance with an open mind, sincerely serve the public, and unite all sectors of society to write a new chapter.  Throughout the whole process of the chief executive election, there was no longer wanton confrontation or arbitrary attacks and smears.  The election is the true embodiment of the spirit of democracy, the office said.  ADVANTAGES OF ELECTORAL SYSTEM SHOWN  The success of the election, the office noted, has once again proved the advanced nature and strengths of the new electoral system of the HKSAR.  In strictly implementing the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," the new electoral system ensures the election of talented patriots administering Hong Kong, the office said.  President Xi Jinping has stressed that to ensure the steady practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong in the long run, the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong" must be always upheld, it noted.  "The criteria for a patriot are objective and clear," the office said. "A patriot is one who sincerely safeguards China's national sovereignty, security and development interests, respects and upholds the fundamental system of the country and the constitutional order in the HKSAR, and goes all out for prosperity and stability in Hong Kong."  By preventing the forces that oppose China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong from participating in the HKSAR's government system, the new electoral system can ensure that the people elected to key public offices of the HKSAR are all firm patriots, the office said.  The new electoral system of the HKSAR is committed to the building and development of a high-quality democracy with Hong Kong characteristics where the position of Hong Kong people as their own masters is fully guaranteed, the office said.  The advantages and unique features of the new electoral system have been fully demonstrated in the three elections, it noted.  First, it is broadly representative. Those who got elected are from various social groups, sectors and backgrounds and include a number of community-level and young people. They can extensively solicit opinions from the public and help smooth the operation of channels for different groups to make their voices heard about their rights and interests.  Second, it is politically inclusive. Participants represent various political groups, espousing different political philosophies. Upholding the principle of loving the country and Hong Kong, the new electoral system has ensured inclusiveness and diversity to the greatest possible extent.  Third, it ensures balanced participation. The design of the new electoral system for the HKSAR ensures balanced political participation and takes into consideration the different interests of all sectors of Hong Kong community, better striking a balance among the overall interest of Hong Kong and the interests of various sectors and different areas.  Fourth, it guarantees fair competition. The candidates try their best to convince voters by focusing on their competitiveness in professional ability, election manifesto, idea, sense of responsibility and contribution, making the election more rational, fairer and better-organized. In that way, the new electoral system ensures that the process reflects popular will, pools people's wisdom and serves the good of the public. It is a broad-based and real democracy that works.  The office said the new electoral system is conducive to upholding the executive-led system while improving the efficiency in administration. Hong Kong practices the executive-led system with the chief executive at its core, and the new electoral system helps to end the long-standing conflict between the legislative and executive agencies and solve the strife within the Legislative Council, enabling the HKSAR government and all sectors to concentrate on developing economy, improving people's livelihoods, and shoring up the region's strengths in global competition.  The office said the improved electoral system optimizes and enhances the democracy of the HKSAR, effectively underpinning the long-term peace, stability and development of Hong Kong.  HONG KONG POISED FOR BRIGHTER FUTURE  With the new electoral system put into full practice, the national security law in Hong Kong thoroughly implemented, and rectification carried out in key areas, Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order is further advanced, said the office. It added that the Hong Kong society now shows greater solidarity and harmony, and its business environment has been improved.  As long as the new HKSAR government and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong seize the historical opportunities, and endeavor against all odds, Hong Kong is certain to embrace an even brighter tomorrow, the office noted.  The conditions are in Hong Kong's favor. With the new electoral system in place, more patriots with outstanding capabilities are entering the administration structure of the HKSAR, forming a patriotic, responsible and united administrative team that serves the people.  Hong Kong maintains its outstanding advantages. The Chinese central government unswervingly implements the principle of "one country, two systems" and opens up wider to the world. In this process, Hong Kong's unique status and functions are certain to be strengthened, instead of being weakened.  Hong Kong has great opportunities. By integrating itself more into the overall national development, Hong Kong will see more space for development. The central government fully supports Hong Kong in participating in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road cooperation. In the meantime, the country's 14th Five-Year Plan specifically underscores the support for Hong Kong in elevating its position as an international center of finance, shipping and trade, and an international air traffic hub, among others.  Hong Kong's development is safeguarded by the central government. Whenever Hong Kong faces difficulties, the motherland always reaches out a helping hand. For instance, in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, the central government fully supported Hong Kong's battle against the virus with decisive measures.  Hong Kong's new starting point coincides with the country's new journey toward the second centenary goal of building a modern socialist country in all respects, said the office. It noted that this will surely create great synergy for development.  In China's journey toward national rejuvenation, Hong Kong can not and will not be absent, stressed the office.  "The 'Pearl of the Orient' will definitely shine brighter and adorn the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation," the office added. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The election of the sixth-term chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) was held on Sunday with John Lee declared as the winner of the election.

(Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)  "I will faithfully and resolutely undertake this historic mission and shoulder the great responsibility to unite and lead the 7.4 million Hong Kong residents to open a new chapter for Hong Kong," Lee said when meeting the press after the election.  He still awaits the appointment by the Central People's Government before being sworn in as the HKSAR chief executive on July 1, also the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.  PATRIOTS ADMINISTERING HONG KONG  Polling for the election ran from 9:00 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) to 11:30 a.m. on Sunday. Members of the Election Committee cast their secret ballots on a one-person-one-vote basis at the main polling station at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.  The smooth running of the chief executive election marked the further implementation of the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," said Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.    John Lee communicates with a fisherman in Hong Kong, south China, May 3, 2022. John Lee was elected as the sixth-term chief executive designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Sunday. (Xinhua)  In 2021, the HKSAR made systematic amendments and improvements to its electoral system according to the decisions of the NPC and the legislation of the NPC Standing Committee, and successfully held elections of the Election Committee and the seventh-term Legislative Council of the HKSAR, a solid step forward promoting the development of democracy in line with the reality of Hong Kong.  Under Hong Kong's amended electoral laws, the expanded Election Committee comprises 1,500 members from five sectors, and candidates for the office of the chief executive shall be nominated jointly by not less than 188 members of the Election Committee, among whom the number of members of each sector should not be less than 15.  Tam said such stipulations ensure that the Election Committee is widely representative and the result of the chief executive election is sound under the improved electoral system.  Lau Siu-kai, vice president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, said the Election Committee fully represents the positions and interests of the growing patriotic forces of different sectors and groups.

(Xinhua)  The sixth-term chief executive election has further enhanced the unity of the patriotic forces and the implementation of the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," Lau said.  Tse Hiu-hung, a member of the Election Committee, said it is the committee's responsibility to elect a chief executive who can fully and accurately implement "one country, two systems" and lead Hong Kong toward better development.  NEW CHAPTER FOR HONG KONG  Announcing his decision to run for the election a month ago, the 64-year-old Lee said if he wins the election, his administration will work on three goals: first, to address different issues with a result-oriented approach; second, to enhance Hong Kong's overall competitiveness; and third, to lay a solid foundation for Hong Kong's development.

John Lee was elected as the sixth-term chief executive designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Sunday. (Xinhua)  Chan Yung, a member of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of the HKSAR, said the three goals outlined by Lee fit Hong Kong's actual situation and accurately capture the key to Hong Kong's future development.  With the support from the central authorities and the efforts from the Hong Kong society, Hong Kong will surely usher in a new chapter in the coming five years, Chan said.  Lee said that he wishes to lead Hong Kong in opening a new chapter which is from order to prosperity in the next five years.  His election manifesto contains four tenets of vision: to strengthen governance capability and tackle pressing livelihood issues together; to streamline procedures and provide more housing and better living; to enhance overall competitiveness and pursue sustainable development; and to build a caring and inclusive society and enhance upward mobility for youths.  Joseph Chan, a member of the Election Committee of the HKSAR, said Lee has made clear and unambiguous proposals on strengthening patriotic education for youths in Hong Kong, promoting better integration of Hong Kong youths into the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and initiating targeted measures to solve housing problems.  Chan, who is also the president of the Hong Kong Youth Association, said that Lee's proposed policies will allow more Hong Kong youths to live a peaceful and prosperous life.  Zhi Zhenfeng, a researcher with the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Lee's election manifesto further expands the space for Hong Kong's development and provides a path for Hong Kong to maintain and enhance its international competitiveness.

(Xinhua)  This year marks the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. The governing team of the new term of the HKSAR government shoulders responsibilities in ensuring the implementation of "one country, two systems" without being bent or distorted.  In the eyes of Chan Yuet-lan, a local resident, Hong Kong has seen a lot of ups and downs in the past two years. "Only when the social environment is stable and harmonious can our families be happy and healthy," she said.  Amid the increasingly complicated international environment, Hong Kong faces multiple security threats. It has always been the primary duty of those administering Hong Kong to do everything possible to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests as well as Hong Kong's interests, said Zhang Jian, director of the Hong Kong and Macao research section of the Shanghai Institute of International Studies.  Lee said the next five years will be a crucial period for Hong Kong in which Hong Kong will transform from order to prosperity amid opportunities and challenges.  The new HKSAR government will act to win confidence with actions, narrow differences with results, and build mutual trust with achievements, so as to work together to build a more livable, open and harmonious Hong Kong that is full of hope, opportunities and vitality, said Lee.

The return of Hong Kong to the motherland marked the opening chapter of its democracy.  　　However, for a certain period of time, anti-China agitators sabotaged the rule of law in Hong Kong, disrupted constitutional and social order, and attempted to put Hong Kong's democracy on a wrong path.  　　The central authorities have promptly improved the electoral system of Hong Kong in accordance with its conditions. It represents the continued improvements to Hong Kong's democratic institutions, and has laid a solid foundation for the healthy development of democracy in the region.  　　The election of the HKSAR's sixth-term chief executive was held in full accordance with laws and regulations, as well as in a fair, impartial and open manner, fully demonstrating the advantages of the new electoral system.  　　The restructured Election Committee has a wider social basis. It is more representative, with more balanced participation by all sectors of society. It thus will enable the chief executive elected under the new system to better represent the overall and fundamental interests of Hong Kong.  　　John Lee received 786 valid nominations from Election Committee members during the nomination period and won the election with 1,416 votes, showing that he has won the approval of the majority of Election Committee members and carries expectations of Hong Kong residents.  　　With the full implementation of the new election system, a number of talented patriots with ideals, a broad mind, a strong sense of responsibility, and competence will enter the governance structure of the HKSAR. They will be tasked with the great mission of facilitating the steady and sustained development of "one country, two systems."  　　Assuming such important roles when Hong Kong is going through a transition from stability to further prosperity, they must unite various sectors to serve the people faithfully, safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintain prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.  　　Under the leadership of the sixth-term chief executive and his team, Hong Kong will surely overcome difficulties and continue to forge ahead, writing a new chapter in the successful practice of "one country, two systems."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.  U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL  Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.  Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.  "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."  The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."  Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."  Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.  Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.  "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.  As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.  "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.  "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.  From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.  A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."  This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."  ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE  Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.  With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.  The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.  "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."  The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.  Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.  "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.  Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.  "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.  "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.  VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN  It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.  Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.  "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.  Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."  "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Najib Balala, the cabinet secretary of the Ministry for Tourism and Wildlife, told journalists in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, that trial runs by motorists are expected to commence on the facility from Saturday.  "The future is bright for the tourism sector because the Nairobi expressway is expected to reduce travel time from the airport to various tourism destinations across the city," Balala said Thursday evening during the fifth-anniversary celebration of Park Inn Hotel, Nairobi.  He observed that tourists have been facing delays in moving between the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Nairobi's central business district.  "With the expressway, tourists will take about ten minutes from arrival at the airport to the city center, instead of taking more than two hours currently," he added.  The 27.1-km Nairobi Expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model and consists of four-lane and six-lane dual carriageways.  The Kenyan official said the Nairobi expressway will ensure tourists can enjoy the city's beautiful scenery due to seamless connectivity. "We want tourists to enjoy a seamless travel experience from their arrival so as to enhance their tourism experience in Kenya."  According to the Ministry for Tourism and Wildlife, the Nairobi expressway will also attract more international hotel brands to set up operations in Kenya's capital city as the level of traffic congestion reduces.  A trial run of the expressway will be launched Saturday.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to a query about a joint statement issued by Japan and the EU at a summit on Thursday, which expressed "concerns" over the situation of the Diaoyu Islands, East China Sea, South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, as well as so-called human rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.  Japan and the EU have hyped up China-related issues, made smearing remarks against China, interfered in China's internal affairs and instigated regional confrontation, Zhao said. "China is firmly opposed to such practice, and has lodged stern representation with relevant parties."  Zhao said the Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands have always been an inherent part of the Chinese territory, adding no matter what is said or done, the fact can never be altered that the islands belong to China.  Regarding maritime issues, Zhao said China will firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and at the same time is ready to settle differences with relevant countries via consultations.  As for issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, Zhao said they all fall within China's internal affairs, which brook no interference by any external forces. "We urge relevant countries to focus on putting their own house in order."  China's development means important opportunities for the world, Zhao said, citing facts that China's economy has contributed 30 percent to the world economic growth, and China's achievements in COVID-19 response have helped stabilize the global supply chain. The Belt and Road Initiative has benefited more than 180 countries and international organizations.  "The so-called China threat theory has gone bankrupt in face of facts," Zhao said.  Noting the world needs unity and cooperation more than ever before in face of challenges such as the resurgences of COVID-19 and lackluster economic recovery, Zhao urged Japan and the EU to abandon seeking ideological confrontation and a zero-sum game mindset, to practice real multilateralism and inject more positive energy into the world.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Zardari made the remarks during his virtual address to the 2nd Global COVID-19 Summit co-hosted by the United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal.  Every country and region will have to devise its own anti-virus strategy, and one-size-fits-all approach cannot be used to battle such pandemics, he said, adding that China's dynamic zero-COVID approach is rooted in China's realities.  Zardari also lauded China for providing COVID-related assistance to countries that needed it, besides Pakistan.  Talking about measures to control the virus, he said that any approach to deal with the pandemic must be grounded firmly in scientific evidence and logic, and responses, monitoring and evaluation should be guided by established methods of epidemiology and community medicine.  The top Pakistani diplomat also said that international cooperation and coordination are of fundamental importance to the success of national efforts.  "It has been evidently clear in the last two years that our survival hinges on our ability to work together," he said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

In May 1992, China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, recognized and established diplomatic relations with Croatia, which was of great significance because Croatia was still fighting for statehood and international recognition at that time, Josipovic said, adding that bilateral relations have developed well since the establishment of diplomatic ties, and practical cooperation has been continuously deepened.  "Today, I think we have very good relations. We do not have any open issues, probably we should be more intensively engaged in establishing more cultural and economical cooperation," he said.  Josipovic noted that bilateral contacts should be strengthened, not only between the two governments but also between businesses and cultural institutions, and that more projects should be launched for both sides.  According to the former president, Croatia has always valued cooperation with China, the world's second largest economy, with the Chinese-built Peljesac Bridge serving as an example of bilateral cooperation.  Josipovic also supports closer high-level political and economic ties and cooperation between China and the European Union, noting that global peace and stability, in which China has played a positive role, require cooperation among all countries.  "Croatia is always in favor of it, and I am sure that our government will support the idea of better cooperation between the European Union and China," he said.  China and Croatia established diplomatic relations on May 13, 1992. In 2005, the two countries established a comprehensive cooperative partnership, marking a new stage in the development of bilateral ties. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a daily news briefing when asked to comment on a U.S. Interior Department report that at least 500 native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died while in boarding schools operated or supported by the U.S. government.  "Such a report is long overdue," Zhao said. Prior to that, the U.S. government had never kept official statistics on the real conditions of these schools, or verified the number of Indigenous children who went to the institutions, died there or were missing.  In fact, the United States was reluctant to admit the existence of the history at first, and even tried to cover it up, Zhao added.  Zhao said that the report shows from 1819 to 1969, indigenous children went through unfair treatment including whipping, sexual abuse, forced labor and severe malnourishment in more than 400 federal Indian boarding schools, and more than 500 children died as a result.  Noting the United States is founded on the atrocious massacre and persecution of the indigenous population, Zhao said the maltreatment of Native Americans is the U.S. original sin convicted by the Indian boarding schools.  Native Americans used to be the dominant population in North America, but their population has shrunk to represent only 2 percent of the current U.S. population after massacre and eviction, Zhao said.  The United States adopted cultural assimilation and occupied Indian reservation with forced separation and resettlement of indigenous children, the spokesperson said, adding the trauma generations have gone through persists even till today.  Native Americans are still under discrimination with worrying health conditions and destitution. Among all the ethnic communities of the United States, Native Americans have the lowest life expectancy, the highest poverty rate, the highest rate of youth alcohol abuse, and the lowest community doctor-to-patient ratio. In 2019, about 25 percent of Native Americans lived in poverty, which is 2.5 times that of the national average, Zhao said.  "The dark history of Indian boarding schools is only a tip of the iceberg of the U.S.' systemic racial discrimination and human rights problems," he said.  Noting racial minorities including Americans of Asian, African, Latin American descent and Muslims still cannot breathe or gain security, Zhao said statistics from U.S. research institutions revealed that anti-Asian hate crimes surged by 339 percent in 2021.  From the "Tulsa Massacre" to George Floyd, and to Patrick Lyoya of Michigan who died of police violence not long ago, the list of African American deaths only grows amid racial discrimination, Zhao said.  People of Latin American descent, accounting for 19 percent of the U.S. population, only possess 2 percent of the country's wealth. Up to 93.7 percent of Muslims in the United States are living in the shadows of Islamophobia, he added.  "The United States should fulfill its commitment of 'all men are created equal' with concrete actions, and adopt serious measures to truly help ethnic minorities get over their trauma," Zhao said.  More importantly, the United States should learn from history, treat the social endemic of racism, and avoid repeating the human tragedies time and again, he added.

In 2021, compared with the previous year, Ethiopia's exports to China increased by 8 percent as new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from Chinese companies to Ethiopia grew by 346 percent, the official said.  Zhao made the remarks during the China-Ethiopia Investment and Trade Cooperation Forum that was co-hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Investment Commission (EIC) and the Investment Promotion Agency of the Ministry of Commerce of China on Thursday in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.  The value of newly signed contract projects by Chinese companies in Ethiopia was up by 25 percent in the same period, Zhao said.  According to the Chinese ambassador, Chinese FDI in Ethiopia and other main indicators of bilateral commercial cooperation has maintained good momentum during the first quarter of the current year.  Zhao said for consecutive years, China has been Ethiopia's biggest trading partner, the top source of FDI and the largest project contractor, as the two countries deepen cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative.  "Practice has proved that no matter how the international situation changes, the overall direction of China-Ethiopia practical cooperation and long-term friendship will never change," Zhao told forum.

Ethiopia and China on Thursday held the investment and trade cooperation forum that aimed at further augmenting trade and economic ties. (Xinhua/Wang Ping)  ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and China on Thursday held an investment and trade cooperation forum that aimed at further augmenting trade and economic ties.  The China-Ethiopia Investment and Trade Cooperation Forum was co-hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Investment Commission (EIC) and the Investment Promotion Agency of the Ministry of Commerce of China in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.  During the forum, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Investment Cooperation was signed between the two countries, which will serve as a new cooperation mechanism to promote investment cooperation and inject new impetus to the collaboration of the two countries.  The forum, which was held in a hybrid format, brought together senior Ethiopian government officials, the business community from the two countries, as well as the Chinese diplomatic community in Addis Ababa. Senior Chinese government officials also took part in the high-level investment and trade forum virtually from China.  While addressing the forum, Ethiopia's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen emphasized that the East African country has become one of the largest recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa, in which Chinese engagement has injected a much-needed momentum to the country's drive.  He said Chinese investment in communication technologies, large-scale infrastructure, industrial parks and manufacturing sectors have certainly augmented the efforts of the Ethiopian government to create a competitive and sustainable industrial development base.  "Indeed, China has proven to be our most-trusted economic and political partner, and its support continues to reinforce the impressive growth trajectory of Ethiopia," Mekonnen said, declaring that the newly signed cooperative instrument "will play a unique role by developing institutional capacity of the EIC in promoting and facilitating Chinese investment inflows to new heights."  The forum, among other things, aimed at implementing the Nine Programs of China-Africa cooperation announced by China at the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), promoting China's Initiative for Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa, and facilitating development plans such as the joint building of programs under the Belt and Road Initiative.  It further envisaged facilitating the implementation of the China-Africa Cooperation Vision 2035 as well as Ethiopia's Homegrown Economic Reform while further deepening China-Ethiopia comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership.  Vice Minister Qian Keming of Commerce of China, in addressing the forum via video link, on his part emphasized that since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries more than 50 years ago, the political mutual trust between the two countries has been continuously deepened, and the cooperation in various fields such as economy and trade has achieved practical and fruitful results.  "China and Ethiopia need to strengthen solidarity, deepen friendly cooperation, achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, and promote steady progress in economic and trade cooperation between the two countries," he said.  He emphasized that the two countries need to implement the Nine Programs of China-Africa cooperation, deepen the synergy of development strategies, promote the healthy development of economic and trade cooperation, and enrich the exchange and cooperation mechanism.  Qian affirmed that China is willing to join hands with Ethiopia to uphold the spirit of China-Africa friendly cooperation and jointly advance bilateral economic and trade cooperation to a new level, so as to bring more tangible benefits to the two peoples.  China has been Ethiopia's largest trading partner and biggest source of investment for many consecutive years.  In 2021, bilateral trade volume reached 2.66 billion U.S. dollars, of which, China imported commodities of nearly 370 million U.S. dollars from Ethiopia, a year-on-year increase of 8.1 percent.  EIC Commissioner Lelise Neme also echoed the Ethiopian deputy prime minister's comments as she emphasized that the newly signed MOU will lay down a foundation for a strong economic relationship between the two countries.  "China is not only a reliable development partner and consistent supporter of Ethiopia's development efforts but also a role model and exemplary on how to formulate and implement development policies and eliminate poverty to achieve inclusive and sustainable development," Neme said. "The growing Chinese investment in Ethiopia is a continuation of the generous development support that China provided through various channels, including the Belt and Road Initiative."  Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia Zhao Zhiyuan said the Investment and Trade Cooperation Forum is "highly timely and relevant" to promote the development of businesses between the two countries toward creating a more favorable business environment.  "I am confident that, the signing of the MoU today to promote investment cooperation will create a new cooperation mechanism and inject new impetus to our collaboration," the ambassador said.

Stephen Par Kuol, the minister of Peace Building, said there is a need to portray South Sudan in a positive light globally after years of conflict ended with the signing of the 2018 revitalized peace deal.  "South Sudan is emerging out of war and the war has been with us for a very long time, we just ended the conflict that resulted in the independence of this country then afterward we ran into another war," Par said during the launch of "My Peace" project in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.  Par said embracing a peace agreement is key to transforming the mindsets of the South Sudanese population who have been traumatized by decades of war.  "I think it is a progressive step in the right direction that the media is not only reporting the crisis in South Sudan, war and conflict but also positive developments," said the minister. He disclosed that the council of ministers recently passed a resolution to promote peace in South Sudan, adding that the media will be the vehicle for the dissemination of peace messages.  Oyet Patrick Charles, the president of the Union of Journalists of South Sudan (UJOSS), encouraged media organizations to set the agenda for peace promotion in order to reach out widely to the public.  "There are positive things happening and it is our duty to set an agenda, I would be very happy to see every media house having a program designed specifically on peace implementation," said Oyet.  He disclosed that the dissemination of positive news on the peace process will inform people at the grassroots and also encourage them to participate in the process.  Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan Hua Ning said the world's youngest nation has witnessed positive progress in the peace process that in turn has led to relative economic recovery.  "The past three years have witnessed the positive outcomes of the peace process one after another. I have seen the gradual recovery of South Sudan's economy and the improvement of people's lives," Hua said.  He stressed that despite persisting challenges in the peace process, the positive changes are obvious to all.  "As a supporter, participant and contributor to the peace process of South Sudan, the Chinese embassy hopes that 'My Peace' project could enhance South Sudanese people's confidence and belief in peace, encourage them to better participate in the country's economic and social development to realize the country's long-term stability while improving their livelihoods through hard work," said the Chinese ambassador.

"Achieving peace is the best protection for children. Dialogue and negotiation is the most realistic and feasible way to reach a cease-fire," said Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations. "The international community should encourage Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiation track and to keep accumulating political conditions for the restoration of peace."  China welcomes the presidential statement adopted by the Security Council on Ukraine on Friday, which calls for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and voices support for the UN secretary-general's efforts to promote peace, he told a Security Council meeting on the issue of children and education in Ukraine.  Sanctions will not bring peace, but will only accelerate the spillover of the crisis, triggering sweeping food, energy, and financial crises across the globe, and making children around the world suffer the bitter consequences. Children living in conflict situations in Afghanistan, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, as well as the Sahel region are bearing the brunt of the humanitarian impact, he warned.  "China once again calls on all parties to stay rational and exercise restraint, transcend prejudice and divisions, and make unremitting efforts for the early resolution of the crisis in Ukraine and for children to enjoy a peaceful future," said Dai.  The conflict in Ukraine is inflicting on children pains foreign to their age. Protecting children from harm is an obligation under international law that must be fulfilled by parties to the conflict. China reiterates its call for securing children and the civilian infrastructure on which they depend, and to give priority to children in evacuation and humanitarian relief operations, he said.  The conflict has uprooted more than half of the Ukrainian children. Millions of children have taken refuge in neighboring countries. China appreciates the safe shelter, humanitarian assistance, and psychological support provided by Ukraine and neighboring countries, as well as various UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations for those children. China calls on the international community to continue to step up relief efforts to ensure that every child in need can receive effective assistance, he said.  Dai also called for efforts to reduce the risk of human trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse faced by Ukrainian children seeking refuge, especially those separated or unaccompanied.  China supports the World Health Organization in cooperating with Ukraine and the countries concerned to ensure that children can get routine immunization. China supports the UN Children's Fund in helping the Ukrainian government to provide educational supplies and learning opportunities for internally displaced children, and encourages host countries to integrate refugee children into their own education systems, in order to ensure that children's right to education is not disrupted, he said.

In particular, power supply is a major bottleneck delaying the continent's industrialization.    Photo shows a China-constructed 50MW solar power farm in Garissa, Kenya. (Photo courtesy of the IT Electronics Eleventh Design &amp; Research Institute Scientific and Technological Engineering Corporation Limited)  According to World Bank statistics, 51.6 percent of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa did not have access to electricity in 2020, and an estimated 660 million people in the world would lack access in 2030, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa.  To vigorously develop clean energy and build a modern energy system is an inevitable choice for Africa as it is facing the dual challenges of industrialization and low-carbon transition.  As a staunch supporter and important partner of Africa on the path of green development, China has implemented over 100 clean energy and green development projects under the framework of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), to support African countries in the better use of solar, water, wind, methane, and other clean energy resources and contribute to the sustainable development of Africa.  Chinese constructors have built a 50MW solar power farm in Garissa, Kenya, the largest of its kind in East Africa. The plant, which was put into operation in 2019, produces over 76 million kWh of electricity each year on average, supplying power for over 380,000 people from 70,000 families and effectively relieving the pressure of power shortage in the African country.    Photo shows the De Aar wind farm in Northern Cape, South Africa. (Photo courtesy of China Energy Investment Corporation)  The De Aar wind farm in Northern Cape, South Africa, which went into operation in 2017, is the first wind power project in Africa that was invested, constructed and operated by China. The wind farm generates 760 million kWh of clean electricity each year, which is equal to the power produced by burning 215,800 tons of standard coal and reducing emission of 619,900 tons of carbon dioxide. While contributing to South Africa's low-carbon transition, the wind farm also creates jobs for the local community and drives the development of surrounding neighborhoods.  Apart from major clean energy projects, medium- and small-sized new energy power generation and storage projects funded by China are also sprouting across Africa.  A China-aided maintenance program for solar-powered street lamps in Central African Republic kicked off in Bangui, capital of the African country on April 8. The program provided the country with 100 sets of spare street lamps and also repaired damaged lampposts. It is a follow-up to a 2016 aid program in which China erected 200 street lamps for the main roads in Bangui, which was an outcome of the 10 major cooperation plans announced at the 2015 FOCAC Johannesburg Summit.  It’s good to feed a man fish, but better to teach him to fish. The fund, technology and knowledge brought by China to Africa has further accelerated the green transition of the continent. On Feb. 18 this year, the 10th Luban Workshop, a Chinese-aided skill and technology training project, was launched in Madagascar. The project, implemented since 2018, has trained a batch of technical talents for African countries.  In recent years, both China and Africa have taken new energy and green development as a focus of their cooperation.  African Union's Agenda 2063 aims to enhance the abilities to respond to climate change and achieve sustainable development, and has launched a series of flagship projects of new energy. Many African countries also rolled out relevant policies.    Shan Chenglin, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Central African Republic hands over a batch of materials at the launching ceremony of a China-aided maintenance program for solar-powered street lamps in the African country held in Bangui, capital of Central African Republic, April 8, 2022. (Photo courtesy of the Chinese Embassy in Central African Republic)  Last November, China issued a white paper titled "China and Africa in the New Era: A Partnership of Equals," stressing that it will strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Africa on climate change, clean energy, and other ecological and environmental fields.  In the run-up to the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the FOCAC, China and Africa jointly prepared the China-Africa Cooperation Vision 2035, which proposed a new model for common eco-development of China and Africa by transforming to clean and low-carbon energy cooperation. The two sides also signed a declaration on climate change cooperation.  Clean energy is a new common ground and a new area of growth for China-Africa cooperation. As the Belt and Road Initiative goes deeper and the FOCAC keeps releasing its potential, China and Africa will continue expanding their clean energy cooperation, innovating cooperation models and enriching the cooperation, so as to realize the vision of a green Africa.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Martin Mbangweta)  LUSAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Du Xiaohui, the new Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of Zambia, presented the Letter of Credence to Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema in Lusaka, capital of Zambia on Thursday.  The two sides held long and friendly talks afterward.  Du said that it is a great honor and responsibility to be posted to Zambia.  The China-Zambia all-weather friendship was personally forged by the older generation of leaders of our two countries. Carried forward through generations, it has taken deep root in our peoples' hearts, said Du.  Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and Zambia have always followed the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, accommodated each other's core interests and major concerns, advanced cooperation to the benefit of the people of our two countries, and upheld international fairness and justice and the common interests of developing countries, Du said.  He said China attaches great importance to its relations with Zambia and stands ready to work with Zambia to make good use of the two platforms of Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to broaden friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries and bring China-Zambia relations to a higher level.  Hichilema said that Zambia and China enjoy a time-honored friendship with close ties of interests and fruitful cooperation in the fields of economy, culture and security.  He thanked China for its great help in fighting COVID-19 and expressed his willingness to learn from China's development experience and conduct economic cooperation between the two countries.  Hichilema said that there is no limit to Zambia-China cooperation. Zambia will continue to maintain sound relations between the two countries and the two peoples and further consolidate the foundation of friendship.  Attaching great importance to the all-weather friendship between the two countries, the Republic of Zambia arranged a separate presentation ceremony for the Chinese ambassador, which is the first time that President Hichilema graced a separate presentation ceremony for a foreign envoy after taking office.  The ceremony was solemn, warm and friendly. Stanley Kakubo, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and senior diplomats of the Chinese Embassy in Zambia attended the ceremony.

"The United States should not use cooperation as a cover to force others to pick sides, or play with fire on issues concerning China's core interests," said Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson.  It was reported that Kurt Campbell, the White House's Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, said that the United States hopes to take measures to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.  The United States continues to follow the one-China policy, does not support "Taiwan independence," and has no intention of taking provocative actions. But it "wants clarity about the desire to deter steps that would be provocative," according to Campbell.  In response, Zhao said the one-China principle is a universal consensus of the international community and an established basic norm governing international relations.  The United States should abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, the political commitments made to China on the Taiwan question, and U.S. President Joe Biden's statement that the United States does not support "Taiwan independence," Zhao said.  The United States should stop exploiting Taiwan-related issues to engage in political manipulation in an attempt to contain China, he added. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Xi pointed out that since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties 30 years ago, China and Slovenia, treating each other with respect and as equal, have achieved positive results in mutually beneficial cooperation and witnessed increasing cultural and people-to-people exchanges, which brings tangible benefits to the people of the two countries.  In the face of COVID-19, the people of the two countries have supported each other, demonstrating the profound friendship between China and Slovenia, he said.  Xi stressed that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Slovenia relations, saying that he is ready to work with Pahor to take the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties as a new starting point, seize the historic opportunity of jointly building the Belt and Road, strengthen the alignment of development strategies of the two sides, and deepen practical cooperation, so as to inject new impetus into the development of bilateral relations for the benefits of the two countries and their people.  In his message, Pahor earnestly congratulated China on its leapfrog development in various fields, saying that bilateral relations between Slovenia and China enjoy a long history and have seen rapid development since diplomatic ties were established 30 years ago.  He added that economic and trade cooperation has been fruitful and the fields of cooperation are growing, among which ice and snow sports have become a new highlight of cooperation.  As a member of the European Union, Slovenia actively supports enhancing Europe-China relations and is committed to delivering the fruits of cooperation to both sides and the international community, said the president.

(Graphic: Zero-sum or zero-carbon/People's Daily Online)  The Glasgow climate summit held last year was largely viewed as a chance for redemption. After the grim outcome of the (2°C) mitigation target set at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, humanity's "last chance" to save the planet, nations were nudged to give climate cooperation another shot. Few world leaders are more zealous and vocal on the matter than US president Joe Biden, who has proposed a portfolio of ambitious goals and called for joint collaboration between major players and, in particular, the US and China.  Then, last February, in a surprise move, the Biden administration announced that it would extend the Trump-era Section 201 tariffs slapped on solar panels, in a bid to "continue facilitating positive adjustment to competition" from imported photovoltaic cells. Though the administration did offer some clues on the "positive adjustment," almost four years after the tariffs were levied, experts argued that America's solar industry remained nascent in its development despite full-blown trade barriers and that the decision came at an emissions cost.  In an opinion essay published earlier this month in The Hill, John Paul Helveston, an American researcher, debated that tariffs won't help the US build a "robust solar industry." He contended that China's tremendous R&amp;D efforts on photovoltaic (PV) innovations, which helped slash the prices of most PV panels from $2,000 per kilowatt to just $300 per kilowatt, cannot be simply duplicated. It is highly unlikely that another nation will be able to "replicate China's skills in the time frame needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change," he cited an article he co-wrote in Science back in 2019, adding, "Rather than continuing the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese solar panels, the US and others should be partnering with Chinese firms to obtain low-cost technologies and components to increase domestic deployment of renewables as fast as possible to meet the narrow window left to decarbonize."  Low-cost solar technologies and components, however, have been the very items subject to Washington's ongoing investigation.  The New York Times reported on April 29 that, amidst an investigation by the US Commerce Department targeting Chinese-made PV parts, the US solar industry has been "frozen," with over 300 solar projects being "canceled or delayed." American energy enterprises, big and small, have all been dragged into the quagmire of self-censorship over Chinese solar parts. "The investigation is having a catastrophic negative impact on the renewable energy sector and driving up electricity prices. With each day the tariff investigation continues, the country is falling further behind in achieving our climate goals," said Nick Bullinger, COO of a Chicago-based solar company, in an interview that appeared in the Times article.    U.S. President Joe Biden (R) speaks during an event, at the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, on May 9, 2022. Biden said that the administration is "discussing" whether to drop hiked tariffs on Chinese products. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  From the perspective of environmental benefits or from the standpoint of economic interests, Washington's 4-year-long-and-counting solar clampdown is cost-ineffective, as it collides with even Biden's own climate agenda.  US president Joe Biden attended the Glasgow summit with high hopes—100% renewable energy by 2035; but the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), an NGO, estimated that America's current production capacity only makes up 15% of its demand. Neither will taxing and purging Chinese solar panels or PV parts help "bring jobs back home," since even with heavy tariffs the US remains heavily dependent on imported PV products.  Besides, the volume of jobs generated by solar installations in the US is ten times larger than the manufacturing jobs created by the nation's entire solar sector, according to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). As a letter sent to President Biden last January by eight American senators (from both parties) stated, the Section 201 tariffs had "led to the loss of more than 62,000 American clean energy jobs and 10.5 gigawatts of foregone solar deployment." It is difficult then to tell who the tariffs and investigation are designed to punish: overseas solar producers or the American labor force?    Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  But it's not hard to detect what formula is being applied in America's zero-carbon solution—its default zero-sum fixation. After all, the one-nation's-gain-representing-another's-loss mindset takes various shapes in the China-US relations from Washington's point of view.  On the global stage, it is reflected in Washington's unreasonable belief that China's global presence, such as donating COVID-19 vaccines to developing nations, will undermine the superpower's global influence.  In the economic sphere, it is manifested in America's obsession with punitive tariffs, which it deems will help reverse trade deficits and boost domestic industry, even though the burden will ultimately be shifted towards American consumers in the form of rising prices.  In the technological and academic realms, it is showcased in America's year-long crackdown on Chinese tech companies and its unjustified witch-hunt targeting Chinese academics and students.  ... ...  The aforementioned aspects of Washington's zero-sum practices are epitomized by its now-stagnant solar industry, which in turn has demonstrated why such a mindset won't work. Internationally, it will risk hindering the joint cause of emissions reduction; economically, it will impede the low-hanging fruits and long-term benefits brought by the should-be full-fledged solar sector; and, from the perspectives of innovation and technological progress, it will further dampen the outlook of cooperation on green innovations.    Aerial panoramic photo taken on April 21, 2022 shows the Dalad Photovoltaic Power Base in Dalad Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Liu Lei)  Dwelling on a planet that is currently plagued by a global pandemic (accompanied by inflation and a possible recession), haunted by continuous wars and conflicts, and overshadowed by the looming threat of global warming, we all know that a zero-sum fixation and a Cold-War mindset won't help fix any of these global problems. On the contrary, they are destined to make the planet warmer, wars deadlier, and other global puzzles more insoluble.  For Washington, it needs to face the reality that it cannot achieve technological hegemony or climate leadership by setting up a new Iron Curtain to deter and isolate China. Returning to a rational and pragmatic China policy is the sole way to nurture healthy and sustainable China-US ties and encourage the two sides to work together on issues of common and global concern. Conversely, the zero-sum mindset is bound for a lose-lose path.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Yue Yuewei)  BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday met with Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari via video link, calling on the two sides to thwart any attempt to undermine bilateral ties.  Wang said that China and Pakistan are unique and time-tested all-weather strategic cooperative partners. The friendship between two sides will be passed on from generation to generation and will not be shaken or changed by a single incident.  "China will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and dignity and in its commitment to national development and rejuvenation," Wang said, adding that China believes that Pakistan will also firmly stand with China on all issues concerning China's core interests.  Bilawal said he was glad to have his first official bilateral activity since taking office as meeting with Chinese foreign minister.  Bilawal said that both the ruling and opposition parties in Pakistan firmly support the bilateral friendship, which is the consensus shared by Pakistani people. Pakistan firmly upholds the one-China policy and supports China's positions on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and the South China Sea. And Pakistan fully supports the Belt and Road Initiative, especially the construction of the Pakistan-China Economic Corridor.  The two sides also exchanged views on the safety of Chinese citizens and institutions in Pakistan.  In regard to a series of terrorist attacks targeting Chinese nationals in Pakistan over a period of time, Wang said China and Pakistan should take immediate action and take firm and effective measures to deal with it.  "The pressing task is to speed up the investigation of the perpetrators and punish them as soon as possible. We should take targeted measures to improve security protection for Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan, give timely security warnings, and plug security loopholes so as to prevent similar incidents from happening again," said Wang.  China will continue to support Pakistan in enhancing its counter-terrorism capability and is ready to join hands with Pakistan to thwart any attempt of undermining China-Pakistan relations, Wang added.  Bilawal said that Pakistan condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attack on the Confucius Institute at the University of Karachi. Pakistan firmly opposes all terrorist acts and will bring all criminals to justice.  Pakistan is ready to strengthen cooperation with China to enhance its counter-terrorism capability and ensure the safety of all Chinese citizens in Pakistan, added Bilawal.

According to media reports, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne recently met her Solomon Islands counterpart Jeremiah Manele in Brisbane, Australia. Payne said that Australia holds concerns about the China-Solomon Islands security agreement, including the lack of transparency.  "Since Australia declares its 'respect for Solomon Islands' sovereign decision-making,' it should act like it said," spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily news briefing, noting the Pacific Island countries, including the Solomon Islands, are sovereign and independent countries, not a backyard of anyone.  Zhao said that China has briefed on its security cooperation with the Solomon Islands on many occasions. He once again defended the signing of the inter-governmental framework agreement on security cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands as a right of two sovereign states.  "It is normal cooperation in law enforcement and security, and consistent with international law and international customary practices," Zhao said, adding the security cooperation between the two countries is open and transparent and does not target any third party. It proceeds in parallel with the Solomon Islands' existing cooperation with other partners and regional mechanisms and conforms to the common interests of the Solomon Islands and the South Pacific region.  "What we really need to worry about is the fact that Australia, without communication and consultation with the Pacific Island countries, pieces together military blocs and stimulates the arms race together with countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, and brings nuclear proliferation risks to the South Pacific region," Zhao said.  "It is the deeds of Australia that is neither open nor transparent, which countries in the region are deeply concerned about," Zhao said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"During the Vietnam War, the United States used cluster bombs and bio-chemical weapons and committed heinous crimes in Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia," Zhao told a regular press briefing.  According to Cambodian media reports, a U.S.-made explosive device weighing almost one tonne and containing more than 500 kg of explosives was recently uncovered opposite the Royal Palace in the capital Phnom Penh. In April this year alone, at least five unexploded U.S. aerial bombs were discovered in Cambodia, each weighing more than 200 kilograms.  In response to a question on the topic, Zhao said that the United States released more than 15 million tonnes of bombs, landmines and shells in Vietnam, of which about 80,000 tonnes are unexploded and remain scattered over nearly 20 percent of the country's territory, which has killed more than 40,000 people and wounded more than 60,000 since the end of the Vietnam War.  "In Laos, the U.S. troops dropped 270 million bombs, weighing 2 million tonnes in total, meaning one tonne or 135 bombs for each person in the country," Zhao said.  According to incomplete data from Yale University, from October 1965 to August 1973, the United States dropped 2.7 million tonnes of ordnance on Cambodia, said the spokesperson. Statistics from the Cambodian government show that from 1979 to 2021, nearly 20,000 people were killed and more than 45,000 people were crippled by unexploded ordnance including landmines.  "History has proven that the United States is a destroyer of rules and order, a maker of violence and conflict, and a perpetrator of coercive diplomacy," Zhao said.  He said it is a typical U.S.-style double standard for the United States to pin the labels of "coercion" and "militarization" on others while forming small cliques and instigating confrontation in the name of democracy, human rights and rules.  "What the United States defends is its own hegemony and the 'rules of the gang' at the expense of the fundamental interests of small and medium-sized countries," the spokesperson said.  It is the common aspiration of regional countries and the shared hope of the international community to seek peace, solidarity and cooperation rather than turmoil, division and confrontation, Zhao said.  Noting that attempts to provoke bloc confrontation and create turbulence and tension will gain no support, Zhao said Asian countries will never allow the region to be used as a chessboard for major power rivalry or a chess piece for major power confrontation.

Dialogue and consultation is the only correct way to resolve the Korean Peninsula issue. The United States is a direct party to the issue and holds the key to breaking the deadlock. As such, it should take concrete actions to respond positively to the reasonable concerns of the DPRK and create conditions for an early resumption of dialogue, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations.  Although the U.S. side claims to be willing to engage in unconditional dialogue, when it comes to actions, it is continuing to tighten sanctions and exert pressure. This is clearly not constructive, he told the Security Council. "The new draft resolution proposed by the United States, evoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, is centered on furthering sanctions, which is not an appropriate way to address the current situation on the peninsula."  The Security Council, over the years, has adopted numerous resolutions on the issue, which, while authorizing sanctions, have also stressed the need for a peaceful, political, and diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. All these deserve equal attention, said Zhang.  "Sanctions are but a means to an end, and should always serve the overall goal of political settlement. Equating sanctions to or replacing diplomatic efforts is completely putting the cart before the horse, and will not achieve the desired result," he said. "Despite the fact that sanctions have already had a negative humanitarian impact and collateral damage to other countries, the countries concerned are still in total denial, which is inconsistent with the conclusions of various international humanitarian agencies and the 1718 (DPRK Sanctions) Committee's panel of experts."  In response to the latest situation, China and a number of Security Council members have all put forward reasonable proposals to explore ways to take strong actions and promote the political solution to the Korean Peninsula issue, in a way that best garners the consensus of council members. The draft resolution tabled by China and Russia is for this very purpose. Regrettably, the United States, which is the penholder of the DPRK non-proliferation issue, has turned a blind eye to the reasonable proposals of China and other relevant council members, and remains enamored superstitiously with the magic power of sanctions, said Zhang.  "We believe that if the United States changes its negative attitude, it is possible for council members to reach a consensus. We hope that the council members will give serious consideration to the joint China-Russia draft resolution," he said.  The issue of the Korean Peninsula should be looked at historically and comprehensively so as to understand the causes and consequences of the matter at hand. After 2018, there had been a general de-escalation of the situation. The DPRK took a series of measures to denuclearize and de-escalate the situation. The leaders of the DPRK and the United States met in Singapore and reached agreement on establishing a new type of DPRK-U.S. relations, building a peace mechanism on the peninsula, and advancing the denuclearization process. Regrettably, the U.S. side later reneged on its position, and did not reciprocate the DPRK's positive initiatives in accordance with the action-for-action principle, leading to an intractable impasse in the DPRK-U.S. dialogue, adding to the mutual distrust between the two countries, and stalling the denuclearization process, said Zhang.  As a close neighbor, China is highly concerned about the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and has always insisted on maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula, denuclearizing the peninsula, and resolving problems through dialogue and consultation, he said. "We advocate that all parties concerned should prioritize the overall peace and stability on the peninsula, adhere to the direction of dialogue and consultation, meet each other halfway, resume meaningful dialogue at an early date, and explore effective ways to resolve each other's legitimate concerns in a balanced manner."  China is seriously concerned about some recent negative developments, he said.  Some countries are calling for the denuclearization of the DPRK, while they themselves are promoting cooperation on nuclear submarines, which carries serious risks of nuclear proliferation. Some countries profess their concerns about the DPRK's military development, while at the same time developing with much fanfare their own offensive weapons system such as hypersonic weapons. A certain politician in a certain country concerned even went so far as to openly advocate discussing nuclear sharing under the pretext of addressing security threats, he noted.  China's Global Security Initiative is an important guide to resolving the issue of the Korean Peninsula. Security is indivisible. The security of one country cannot be based on the insecurity of another country. Such a concept works anywhere, anytime, he said.  China once again calls on all parties concerned to jointly cherish and maintain peace and stability on the peninsula, work together to promote the establishment of a peace mechanism and denuclearization process on the peninsula, and play a constructive role to this end, Zhang said.

Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to a recent update to the "Taiwan fact sheet" displayed on the website of the U.S. Department of State, which removed wording on not supporting "Taiwan independence" and acknowledging China's position that Taiwan is part of China.  Zhu said some people in the Taiwan region are playing up this issue, in an attempt to garner U.S. support for independence. "Such a move will not change the fact that Taiwan is a part of China."

The theme of this conference is “BRICS Cooperation and Global Development: New Era, New Mission, New Plan”, which was hosted by China Council for BRICS Think-tank Cooperation(CCBTC), the Chinese coordinator for BRICS think tank cooperation, and organized by Sichuan International Studies University, the vice-chairman organization of CCBTC. Think tank scholars and business representatives from BRICS countries carried out in-depth exchanges and discussions under the theme.  Jin Xin, Secretary-General of CCBTC, director-general of the Research Office of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, Ma Ranxi, Deputy Director-General of Publicity Department of Chongqing Committee of CPC and Director of Information Office of Chongqing Municipal Government, and Dong Hongchuan, President of Sichuan International Studies University delivered speeches respectively. Jin Xin said that at present, the shadow of a once-in-a-century pandemic and the conventional security risks are intertwined. Adjustments over the global governance system and the international landscape have gathered pace. The recovery of the world economy is weak and faltering, and the global development gap is widening. Amidst the great changes of the world, the era and the history, the international community, especially developing countries, is in dire need of economic recovery and common development, and generally hope to emerging market countries including BRICS to play a greater role in promoting economic recovery and common development. As China holds the rotating chair of the BRICS this year, it takes “Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development” as the theme of 2022 BRICS cooperation, with the hope to work with all BRICS countries to respond to the major concerns of the international community and build a more comprehensive, closer, more practical and more inclusive BRICS partnership to jointly achieve stronger, greener and sounder global development. Under new circumstances, in order to further deepen BRICS cooperation and promote common development: first, we should give priority to development and jointly promote economic recovery; second, we need to commit ourselves to inclusive development and focus on bridging the development gap; third, we should uphold innovation as the driver of growth and work together to achieve leapfrog development; fourth, we must adhere to green development and accelerate transformation towards green and low-carbon development.    Ma Ranxi said that local-level cooperation among BRICS countries is of great significance. Cooperation at the local level is counted as an important and specific means to promote BRICS practical cooperation, and can provide new ideas and suggestions from the bottom up to national-level cooperation. Chongqing, as a strategic stronghold of China’s western region development and a connection between “Belt and Road” initiative and the Yangtze River Economic Belt, will further expand pragmatic cooperation, people-to-people and cultural exchanges with other BRICS members, and provide more and stronger drivers for BRICS cooperation and global development by promoting local-level exchanges.  Dong Hongchuan said that Sichuan International Studies University is an important base for foreign language education, foreign-related personnel training, as well as foreign language and culture, foreign economic and trade, and international studies in southwest China. It will continue to deeply involve itself in BRICS think-tank international exchanges and cooperation, build a base for think tank consultation, personnel training, and people-to-people exchange for BRICS research in western China, and make due contributions to promoting BRICS cooperation.     Zhu Chaowei, vice president of Sichuan International Studies University, Xu Xiujun, researcher of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhu Jiejin, professor of Fudan University, Sun Yiran, researcher of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, Jiang Shixue, distinguished professor of Shanghai University, Miao Jun, deputy general manager of Power China International Group Limited, Zhang Zhengping, rotating chairman of Chongqing Sokon Industrial Group Co., Ltd, and other Chinese think tank and business representatives believe that in the past 16 years, BRICS countries have made remarkable achievements in establishing New Development Bank and BRICS PartNIR innovation center, and formulating Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025. In the future, BRICS countries should continue to strengthen coordination in various fields of global governance, lead cooperation with development, promote security with development, raise their voice with development, and realize the role change from participants to leaders of global development , from hitchhikers to defenders and builders of international order , and from global public goods demanders to suppliers.      Think tank scholars and representatives from international institutions, such as Applied Economic Research of Brazil, Higher School of Economics of Russia, Observer Research Foundation, Gateway House of India, University of Johannesburg of South Africa, and ECLAC/UN Office in Brasilia, believe that in order to achieve the sustainable development goals, BRICS countries need to further deepen cooperation, conduct dialogue and exchanges with a more open mindset, mobilize their own resources, and work in synergy. On the one hand, BRICS countries should carry out domestic structural reforms, strive to change development modes, policies and models, vigorously develop human capital and social capital, coordinate competition objectives, and achieve fair development on the basis of law and regulations. On the other hand, BRICS countries should always adhere to multilateralism, promote effective global economic governance, and jointly counter the downward pressure and risks of the economy by improving mutual investment complementarity and carrying out scientific and technological innovation cooperation.  （Source: International Department. Central Committee of CPC) Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks when asked to comment on a recent update to the Taiwan fact sheet displayed on the website of the U.S. Department of State, which removes wording both on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging China's position that Taiwan is part of China.  "There is but one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, with the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China," Zhao said, noting that these facts are the consensus of the international community and are universally recognized norms governing international relations.  "The U.S. has made solemn commitments on the Taiwan question and the one-China principle in the three China-U.S. joint communiques," Zhao noted, saying that changing the wording on Taiwan is an act of political manipulation and an attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which will backfire and the U.S. itself will get burnt.  Zhao urged the United States to abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, as well as the political commitments it made to China on the Taiwan question.  "The U.S. side should put into practice President Biden's statement that the U.S. does not support 'Taiwan independence,' and cease all political manipulation on Taiwan-related issues or any attempt to contain China with the Taiwan question," Zhao said.

As Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, Wang attended the inauguration ceremony of Yoon earlier in the day. (Xinhua/Li Tao)  SEOUL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan and South Korea's newly sworn-in President Yoon Suk-yeol agreed on Tuesday to further bilateral ties and pragmatic cooperation.  As Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, Wang attended the inauguration ceremony of Yoon earlier in the day. During the meeting with Yoon, Wang conveyed Xi's cordial greetings and best wishes to him.  China and South Korea, as close neighbors and important partners, have witnessed all-round and rapid development in bilateral relations with increasing common interests since the establishment of diplomatic ties, Wang said, adding that in the face of a changing world and a pandemic unseen in a century, it's of greater importance for both sides, the region and the whole world to strengthen China-South Korea cooperation.  China is willing to work with South Korea to continuously lift the China-South Korea strategic cooperative partnership to a higher level and in keeping with the times, he stressed.  Wang proposed a five-point proposal on the next development of bilateral relations.  Firstly, China and South Korea should enhance strategic communication and high-level exchanges, as well as further invigorate dialogue and exchanges at all levels.  Secondly, the two sides should deepen pragmatic cooperation, strengthen the alignment of development strategies of the two countries, and deepen cooperation in key areas and third-party markets to upgrade bilateral cooperation.  Thirdly, as China and South Korea are geographically linked, their peoples are connected by kinship and cultures enjoy a natural affinity, the two countries should give full play to this advantage and take the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the China-South Korea Year of Cultural Exchanges as an opportunity to plan and implement more activities conducive to enhancing people-to-people friendship, so as to continuously inject positive energy into the growth of bilateral ties.  Fourthly, the two countries should strengthen communication and coordination in international and regional affairs, be committed to upholding multilateralism and the free trade system, and promote regional and global development and prosperity.  Fifthly, the two sides should jointly boost coordination and cooperation in the Korean Peninsula affairs and properly handle sensitive issues. China sincerely supports the two sides of the Korean Peninsula in improving relations and promoting reconciliation and cooperation, and stands ready to cement communication with South Korea to advance the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and promote lasting peace on the peninsula.  For his part, Yoon asked Wang to send his best regards to President Xi.  Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries have witnessed rapid progress in the development of bilateral relations, and the two-way trade has reached an all-time high despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Yoon said.  He noted that the South Korean government, on the basis of mutual respect, is ready to take the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties as an opportunity to promote closer high-level strategic communication and exchanges at all levels, further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in all areas and enhance the people-to-people friendship, so as to usher in a new era for bilateral relations.  South Korea is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to jointly promote peace, stability and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, he added.

Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a daily press briefing when asked to comment on the issue. Initial results show that presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and vice presidential candidate Sara Duterte-Carpio are poised to win.  China hopes and believes that all political forces in the Philippines will continue to work together for national renewal and development, Zhao said.  Calling the two countries "good partners of mutually beneficial cooperation," Zhao said under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, bilateral relations have been steadily upgraded and have taken on a new look of vigorous development, benefiting the two peoples and making positive contributions to regional peace and stability.  China is ready to work with the Philippines to continue to uphold good-neighborliness and friendship, focus on post-pandemic development, expand win-win cooperation, and bring more tangible benefits to the two peoples, the spokesperson said.

Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a regular press briefing when answering a query about Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela possibly being excluded from the summit that will be hosted by the United States in Los Angeles in June.  "The summit cannot solely apply American standards or serve U.S. self-interest. It cannot be reduced to an American summit," Zhao said.  "Next year will mark the 200th year since the U.S. proposed the Monroe Doctrine," Zhao added, noting that the United States has not been a supporter of Latin American countries and has bullied them at will.  The spokesperson said that not only has the United States failed to benefit Latin American countries, but it has also exploited them, imposed sanctions against them, exported inflation to them, engaged in political interference, regime subversion and political assassination in them, and even launched armed aggression against them.  Despite opposition from the international community and regional countries, the United States insists on maintaining unilateral and illegal sanctions against some Latin American countries, smears the legitimate actions of Latin American countries to cooperate with other countries to seek development, and lacks basic respect for Latin American countries, Zhao said.  "We hope the U.S. side will earnestly respect the sovereignty and dignity of Latin American countries, and earnestly abide by the basic norms governing international relations," Zhao said, adding that there is no market for the Monroe Doctrine in Latin America, or anywhere in the world.

"We strongly oppose those unfounded criticisms and misleading comments on the chief executive election contained in the two statements," said a spokesperson for the HKSAR government, adding that they reflect a blatant interference in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs, and are clearly out of line with international norms.  Any allegation that the improved electoral system has weakened democracy in the governance of Hong Kong is misguided. On the contrary, the electoral system has broadened representation in the electorate for the chief executive election through expanding the Election Committee from 1,200 members from four sectors to 1,500 members from five sectors, the government spokesperson added.  Likewise, under the improved electoral system, the Legislative Council's representativeness has been boosted. Its members are now returned by the Election Committee constituency, the functional groups in the functional constituencies, and direct elections in the geographical constituencies. This enables all social sectors to be represented in a fair and balanced manner, according to the spokesperson.  "We strongly believe that improving the electoral system, ensuring 'patriots administering Hong Kong' and safeguarding the overall interests of society are conducive to the stable development of Hong Kong's democracy," the spokesperson said.

The 18th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit kicked off on Sep 10, in Nanning, highlighting the building of a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future. Photo: Xinhua  While China-related topic is expected to dominate the upcoming US-ASEAN summit, a recent survey showed that nearly 80 percent of Chinese respondents said the US is the biggest disruptor of the sound relations between China and ASEAN members but about 90 percent considered the China-ASEAN ties as friendly and over 75 percent hold a positive attitude toward their future.  The survey was jointly conducted by the Global Times Research Center and Centre for Chinese Foreign Strategy Studies, Renmin University of China between March 15 and April 15 in 31 Chinese provinces, regions and municipalities among the general public aged 18 to 69 and college students. It collected 2,012 valid questionnaires from the general public and 1,150 from college students.  About 61.8 percent of the respondents said they have a good impression of ASEAN, and those who have visited ASEAN members share high scores in terms of the impression about the region. On average, the level of affection of the Chinese public toward ASEAN, with a 3.8 score, is much higher than the other blocs and countries. The level for the EU is 3.2 and that for the US is 2.4.  Most of the college students are impressed by the ASEAN's rich resources and culture. They also share a higher level of affection for the region than for the US, EU, Australia, Japan and other countries and regions.  "Those results showed that China and ASEAN have developed very successful relations in the past two to three decades," Lü Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. This results from the ramped-up efforts of China's diplomacy toward Southeast Asia.  The survey also shows that although fewer Southeast Asian countries share divergences with China on questions like the South China Sea, those conflicts are under control, and have not become "the mainstream tone" for bilateral ties. The Chinese public supports and trusts China's policy and its relations with ASEAN, Lü said.  Positive momentum  Although 10 ASEAN members share vast differences, China has been handling the relations with them pretty well, either from diplomatic efforts or the infrastructure cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, which all laid the foundation for the positive momentum in China-ASEAN ties, experts said.  Over 90 percent of the respondents said they are interested in ASEAN, and nearly two-third of them share very high interests. For example, the culture and arts of the region have become a great attraction for the Chinese public. The region's business and trade, technology, nature, history and sports attract about 40 percent of the respondents, according to the survey.  Among the surveyed college students, 54.3 percent said they know ASEAN and over 50 percent said they know the region's politics, geography, culture and economy.  Some 90.4 percent of the respondents said China-ASEAN relations are "friendly" and over two-thirds took it as "very friendly" and "relatively friendly."  "Those survey results are in line with Chinese people's objective perception of the development of China-ASEAN relations," Xu Liping, a research fellow on Southeast Asian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times recently.  In China's neighboring diplomacy, ASEAN occupies a very important position, Xu said, noting that ordinary Chinese will have a higher degree of favorability and affinity for ASEAN, compared with Europe and the US.  "This objectively shows that there is a strong internal driving force for the development of China-ASEAN relations, and strengthening cooperation and friendly people-to-people exchanges will continue to be the mainstream of bilateral relations," he said.  While over 75 percent of the respondents hold a positive view toward the future development of China-ASEAN ties, the question of the South China Sea has become a major focus of China-ASEAN ties, which has been hyped and manipulated by countries like the US and Japan in stirring conflicts between China and ASEAN. And nearly 80 percent of the public surveyed said that the US is the biggest disruptor of the development of China-ASEAN relations.  While the Chinese public shares high interests in ASEAN members, Singapore has become the country that attracted them the most. The average score of affection and interest for Singapore is above 4, with the highest score of 5, followed by Malaysia and Thailand , which both scored 3.8.  Chinese students are most attracted by Singapore, and then Thailand and Malaysia.    How Chinese view China-ASEAN relations Graphic: Deng Zijun/GT Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

Observers have predicted some adjustment and challenges in China-South Korea relations after the power transition in Seoul, considering the US' activities to sow discord and Yoon's remarks of enhancing South Korea's alliance with the US during the election campaign.  US President Joe Biden will stop first in South Korea on May 20 during his first Asian trip since taking office to "highlight the US focus on Indo-Pacific," said White House official Kurt Campbell on Monday. Biden will then visit Tokyo and attend a QUAD summit there.  The US has been putting much effort on winning over South Korea and engaging Seoul into its geopolitical camp, said Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences.  Knowing South Korea won't easily join the security pact of QUAD and serve US interests at the expense of its ties with China, the US offered the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) to attract South Korea, while South Korea is interested in more platforms to communicate with Southeast Asia in regard to trade and supply chains, Da told the Global Times on Tuesday.  The IPEF was proposed by the US in October 2021 and is expected to formally launch later this month. The South Korean government has decided to join the IPEF, a decision reflecting its intention to take a leading role in regional trade as an initial member of the framework, Business Korea reported Tuesday.  The US' blueprint in the Asia-Pacific is to contain China's development by involving as many regional countries as possible to marginalize China in politics, economy and security. Yet other countries will prioritize their national interests rather than solely serve the US' needs, said Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing.  China welcomes all its neighbors to develop balanced relations with other countries on an equal basis, as long as such relations do not harm China's interests, experts said.  Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that China doesn't need to form its own camp to counter US' small cliques, but should maintain strategic confidence. "China is committed to building a better model -- a global system featuring equality, openness and win-win cooperation."  China and South Korea are facing challenges and opportunities internally and externally, and should forge closer ties to jointly cope with those challenges, contributing Asian wisdom to global governance, experts said.  For the new government, the major test is how to make best use of the diplomatic legacy of the Moon Jae-in administration, managing South Korea's foreign relations amid the US-China rivalry, properly handling the increasingly complicated geopolitical realities to maximize South Korea's interests, observers said.  Vice President Wang met with Yoon after attending the latter's inauguration. Wang delivered President Xi Jinping's greetings to Yoon and raised suggestions on bilateral relations in the next phase.  The two sides should enhance strategic communication and high-level exchanges, deepen practical cooperation in key fields and with third party market, hold more activities to enhance people-to-people friendliness, strengthen communication and coordination on regional and international affairs to safeguard multilateralism and free trade, and cooperate on the Korean Peninsula issue and properly handle sensitive topics, Wang said.  Yoon asked Wang to deliver his greetings to Xi. Yoon said South Korea is willing to increase high-level exchanges, enhance cooperation of different areas, and push bilateral relations into a new chapter.  Da noted the attendance of such a high-level Chinese official to the inauguration is unprecedented in China-South Korea relations, and fully demonstrates China's sincerity in further developing ties.  Yoon's tone on many topics in his inauguration speech was softer than in his election campaign. It may take one to two months to observe Yoon's policy based on not only his remarks but also the new government's deeds, Da said.  But as long as the two countries uphold the principle of mutual respect, wisely handle sensitive topics and push forward cultural exchanges to enhance mutual understanding, relations will remain stable, the expert said.

John Lee, 64, former chief secretary for administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, on Sunday won the first chief executive election since the improvement of the region's electoral system in 2021.  "Certain Western countries and institutions are conspiring with each other to slander the election and grossly interfere in China's internal affairs. China expresses firm opposition to this and strongly condemns it," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing.  Some countries have ignored the fact that Hong Kong's democracy has improved and that mainstream public opinion seeks unity and prosperity, Zhao said.  "They sound like 'preachers of democracy' when they point fingers at Hong Kong's democratic elections, its high degree of autonomy, and its human rights and freedoms, which only exposes their double standards and their attempt to bring chaos to Hong Kong and contain China," he said.  "Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong. What kind of electoral system Hong Kong implements and what kind of democratic development path it explores are issues that fall entirely under the scope of China's internal affairs, and no external forces have the right to interfere," Zhao said.  He said the Chinese government is resolved to fully and faithfully implement the "one country, two systems" principle and develop high-quality democracy suited to Hong Kong's reality, and any attempt from external forces to undermine this will be in vain.  He expressed confidence that Hong Kong will usher in a new era of good governance that leads to prosperity. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Xi noted his close contact with Macron over the past five years, which has helped guide the two countries in sustaining the positive momentum of bilateral ties, conducting fruitful cooperation, and fulfilling the responsibilities of major countries on climate change, biodiversity conservation and other issues.  In a world undergoing changes unseen in a century, China and France, two permanent members on the United Nations Security Council and independent major countries, should uphold "independence, mutual understanding, strategic vision and win-win cooperation," a commitment the two sides made when establishing diplomatic relations, stick to their close and enduring comprehensive strategic partnership, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and strengthen coordination and cooperation in the bilateral, China-Europe and global contexts, he said.  Xi added that China will keep close exchanges with France at all levels to promote the healthy growth of China-France relations and maintain world peace and stability.  Xi stressed the need to identify, through bilateral dialogue mechanisms, cooperation priorities in the coming five years. He called on the two sides to step up cooperation in emerging areas including artificial intelligence and clean energy, while advancing cooperation in traditional areas like civilian nuclear energy, and aerospace.  The Chinese president said China is ready to import more quality products from France, welcomes French financial and hi-tech companies to China for business cooperation, and hopes that the French side will provide a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises that conduct investment and cooperation in France.  Xi said that it is important that China and France make good use of big occasions like the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic relations and the Paris Olympics, both to take place in 2024, as important opportunities to further increase people-to-people and cultural exchanges and enhance mutual understanding.  He added that the two sides should follow true multilateralism, uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law, support multi-polarity and economic globalization, and deepen cooperation on climate change and biodiversity.  Xi stressed that the two sides need to increase communication and coordination at the Group of 20 and on global food and energy security, expand trilateral cooperation in Africa and other regions, and explore cooperation on the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative.  The Chinese president pointed out that the steady and sound growth of China-EU relations serves the interests of people in China, in Europe and in all other countries, adding that China appreciates France's commitment to strategic autonomy, and hopes that France will encourage the EU to keep a right perception of China and work with China in the same direction by managing differences properly and building on converging interests for closer cooperation in economy and trade, green and digital development, and people-to-people exchanges.  Xi also expressed his hope for France, who holds the rotating presidency of the EU, to play a positive role in promoting the sound development of China-EU relations.  For his part, Macron commended the open spirit with which the two sides have developed their relations since establishing diplomatic ties.  Over the past five years, the two sides have carried out fruitful cooperation across the board, Macron said.  For the next five years, France will work with China to deepen cooperation in areas including agriculture, aviation, civilian nuclear energy and culture and to scale up cooperation in climate change and biodiversity, with a view to greater achievements in France-China relations, said the French president.  France is willing to play a positive role in the development of EU-China relations, he added.  The two leaders also exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine and agreed that relevant parties should support Russia and Ukraine in restoring peace through negotiations.  Xi stressed that China has been working in its own way to promote peace talks, and that China supports European countries in keeping the security of Europe in their own hands.  He urged vigilance against bloc confrontation, which poses a bigger and more persistent threat to global security and stability.  Macron noted the many common understandings between France and China on the issue of Ukraine, adding that France stands ready for closer coordination and cooperation with China at both bilateral and multilateral levels.  France and the EU are committed to strategic autonomy and will not endorse or take part in bloc confrontation, he said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Their statement smeared the HKSAR's sixth-term chief executive election, and attacked the Chinese central government's policies towards Hong Kong, said a spokesperson for the office.  The ministers and the EU high representative have turned a blind eye to the structural flaws of their own democratic systems, and wantonly attacked the HKSAR's chief executive election and the Chinese government's implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy, said the spokesperson, calling their statement a serious violation of international laws and the basic norms of international relations.  The statement is full of arrogance and prejudice, ignoring the fact that the chief executive election was conducted in accordance with the law and that the result of the fair election is in line with Hong Kong people's aspirations, the spokesperson noted.  The success of the sixth-term chief executive election has further implemented the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," fully demonstrated the advantages of HKSAR's new electoral system, and proved the new system is a good one that follows the "one country, two systems" principle and suits Hong Kong's realities, the spokesperson said.  A Hong Kong with enduring stability and prosperity is not only in the interest of all Hong Kong people but also in the interest of the international community, according to the spokesperson.  Any political manipulation and arbitrary intervention by external forces will not shake the Chinese central government's firm determination to comprehensively and accurately implement the "one country, two systems" principle, nor will they undermine the overall situation of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the spokesperson stressed.

During the meeting, Xi also expressed his hope that Germany will play a positive role in developing a steady and sound China-EU relationship.  On various occasions, Xi has elaborated on the importance of strengthening China-Germany relations as well as China-EU ties. The following are some highlights of Xi's remarks in this regard.  May 9, 2022  In the virtual meeting with Scholz, Xi said both China and Germany are major countries with important influence.  Under the current circumstances, it is particularly important for the two countries to maintain sound and steady growth of bilateral ties and better harness the stabilizing, constructive and steering role of this relationship, Xi said.  This not only serves the interests of the Chinese and German peoples but will also contribute significantly to world peace and tranquility, Xi added.  Xi underscored that China and the EU are comprehensive strategic partners and each other's opportunity, and that the two sides have far more common interests than differences.  It is important that the two sides, with a dialectical and long-term view, with mutual respect and with the right perception, increase communication and enhance mutual trust, Xi said.  March 8, 2022  During a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and Scholz, Xi noted that China and the EU share much common understanding on promoting peace, seeking development and advancing cooperation.  Xi said it is important for the two sides to enhance dialogue, stay committed to cooperation, and promote steady and sustained progress of China-EU relations.  China's development will create broader space for China-EU cooperation, Xi said, adding that the two sides must, under the principle of mutual benefit and win-win, further deepen green and digital partnerships as well as practical cooperation in various fields.  Dec. 21, 2021  In a phone conversation with Scholz, Xi said China attaches great importance to its relations with Germany, noting that the two countries should chart the general course of bilateral relations from a strategic perspective.  Over the past half century, China-Germany relations have demonstrated ample vitality, endurance, resilience and potential, Xi said, adding that for the next 50 years, the two countries should embrace a global vision from a long-term perspective, forge ahead and strive for new development of China-Germany relations.  Dec. 8, 2021  In a congratulatory message to Scholz on his election as German chancellor, Xi said he is willing to work with Scholz to promote the bilateral ties to a new level.  China and Germany are all-round strategic partners, Xi noted, adding that over the years, they have been adhering to mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and pursuing win-win cooperation, which has yielded results benefiting the two countries, their people and the world.  Facing the major changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, China and Germany have strengthened communication and cooperation, jointly supported the global fight against COVID-19 and promoted economic recovery, demonstrating their sense of responsibility as major countries, Xi said.  Oct. 13, 2021  During a virtual meeting with then German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Xi and Merkel reviewed the development of China-German and China-EU relations in recent years.  Noting that 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, Xi said that keeping bilateral ties on the right course is of crucial importance.  "China always views its relationship with Germany from a strategic and long-term perspective, and is ready to maintain high-level exchanges with the German side, promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples, tap the potential for cooperation in traditional fields, while exploring new areas of pragmatic cooperation in energy transition and the green and digital economy, among other areas, to further advance bilateral ties," Xi said.

Speaking at the distribution ceremony held in the Afghan capital Kabul, Economic and Commercial Counselor of the Chinese embassy in Afghanistan Hu Guo'ai said China and Afghanistan are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers, with exchanges between the two countries dating back to more than 1,000 years ago. The Chinese government has been highly concerned about the Afghan people who are suffering from a humanitarian crisis, and has continuously provided them with humanitarian assistance such as food, clothing, vaccines, tents and medicines.  China's South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund provided funds for buying emergency relief supplies and supporting local education for vulnerable groups in Afghanistan. The batch of supplies purchased and distributed by the UNHCR includes kitchenware, blankets and gas tanks, the counselor said.  All the supplies have been distributed all over Afghanistan, Hu said, adding the needy Afghans will get relief with the supplies.  Kari, the representative of the recipient party and head of the Kabul Education Department, expressed his sincere gratitude to China for its long-term assistance to Afghanistan.  Kari noted that China's assistance has greatly improved the learning conditions of Afghan students and will inspire them to study with more enthusiasm.  Some 19.7 million Afghans were facing acute hunger, according to an analysis conducted in January and February by Food Security and Agriculture Cluster partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and many non-governmental organizations.  The FAO and the WFP said on Tuesday that they have provided humanitarian assistance to millions of people in Afghanistan, and are scaling up their programs to assist and support needy families.

China has been Germany's most important trading partner for six years in a row, starting from 2015, Germany's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) said. In just 10 years' time from 1980 to 1990, China surged from the 35th to 14th place among the most important importers for Germany.  "China's importance for German imports is growing steadily," Destatis noted.  China is one of the world's most important growth markets and also an important partner for Germany in tackling global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, said Juergen Friedrich, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Germany Trade &amp;Invest, the country's foreign trade and inward investment agency.  The aggregate volume of bilateral trade reached a new record in 2021, Friedrich said, adding that German companies in China "continue to express investment intentions, including the localization of production and research and development" in China.  Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of China-Germany diplomatic relations, Oliver Zipse, chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, said, "Our experience in China is a good example of successful collaboration between the two countries and between China and Europe."  "From our perspective, collaboration and mutual trust are key to addressing the ongoing challenges that lie ahead for all of us. And they are key to creating growth and prosperity," he added.  The future prospects are further brightened by China's policy decisions, said Zipse. "Looking ahead, we are encouraged by China's pledge to further open its market, as well as its efforts to promote green development and innovation."  German companies attach great importance to practical and mutually beneficial cooperation with China and derive tangible benefits from their cooperation with China, said Wang Weidong, chief of the Economic and Commercial Department at the Chinese Embassy in Germany.  Wang told Xinhua that German companies have a great interest in expanding and deepening their economic and trade cooperation with China.  "China and Germany have made important achievements in their cooperation over the past 50 years for the benefit of the people of both countries and the world, and this mutually beneficial cooperation is particularly valuable in the turbulent situation facing the world today," Wang said.

In a keynote speech delivered virtually, Wang called for an equal and balanced global development partnership and for support of the United Nations' overall coordination function in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Guterres, in a video message, called for joint efforts to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  "We can't lose more ground. It's time to rescue the SDGs and give sustainable development a fighting chance -- for people, for planet, for our common future," he said.  Participants in the high-level segment spoke highly of China's leading role in promoting sustainable development, and expressed their strong support for the GDI and the hope that the Group of Friends members will work together to deepen cooperation in priority areas so as to facilitate global development.  In the discussion segment, representatives of the Group of Friends appreciated the convening of the high-level meeting and expected the group to expand and deepen practical cooperation.  In concluding remarks, Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, said the high-level meeting has not only pointed the way for future cooperation, but also strengthened confidence in the development of the group.  "With today's meeting, the GDI has taken another step forward at the United Nations. Next, the group will continue its work centered around the three key areas of strengthening policy dialogue, sharing best practices, and promoting practical cooperation," he said.  At the same time, he said, in light of the new situation, the group will also focus on the four areas of effectively addressing global crises, facilitating the implementation of the UN development agenda, deepening South-South cooperation, and tapping the potential of resources.

While addressing the high-level virtual meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI on Monday, Zardari expressed concerns over the reversal of progress in the implementation of SDGs, owing to multiple crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and geopolitical conflicts, according to the Foreign Ministry of Pakistan.  He urged the Group of Friends of the GDI to address the challenges faced by the developing world and support emergency actions to increase cooperation in public health and vaccine equity, ensure food security, enhance energy production, promote a global green economy, stimulate trade and industrialization, and eliminate the digital divide, the ministry said in a statement.  Multiple crises have enlarged the gap in financing for development, he said, adding that the international community should mobilize adequate resources for SDGs and fulfill the commitment of providing at least 100 billion U.S. dollars annually in climate finance.  In his address, Zardari reaffirmed his country's resolve to further strengthen its all-weather strategic cooperative partnership with China, including through the rapid implementation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative, the statement added.  "Pakistan will continue its efforts to enhance cooperation with China through CPEC, to advance its national implementation of SDGs, in addition to participating actively in the work of the GDI Group of Friends to promote the common aspiration of a peaceful, prosperous and shared future for all mankind," he said.

Wang, Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, arrived here to attend the inauguration ceremony of President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol. (Xinhua/Li Tao)  SEOUL, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan met with South Korea's outgoing President Moon Jae-in on Monday, saying China-South Korea relations have made significant progress over the past five years.  Wang, Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, arrived here to attend the inauguration ceremony of President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol.  Noting that this year marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations, and the China-South Korea Year of Cultural Exchanges, Wang said the two countries have maintained close high-level exchanges, deepened practical cooperation and maintained smooth multilateral communication and coordination.  The Chinese and South Korean economies are highly integrated, Wang said, adding that in particular, economic cooperation between the two countries managed to grow amid the sluggish global economy last year, demonstrating the resilience and great potential of bilateral economic cooperation.  Wang said China and South Korea are close neighbors and major cooperative partners with broad common interests.  "No matter how the international and regional situation changes, the fundamentals of China-South Korea friendly cooperation will not change and cannot be changed, which is an important inspiration from the history of bilateral relations," he noted.  Wang said China is willing to join hands with South Korea in pushing forward the China-South Korea strategic cooperative partnership to benefit people of the two countries.  China appreciates South Korea's important contributions to improving inter-Korean relations and promoting the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue, Wang said, noting that China stands ready to enhance communication and coordination with South Korea to make joint efforts to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region at an early date.  For his part, Moon said that over the past five years, South Korea-China relations have overcome difficulties and achieved development, expressing his hope that the next government will maintain such a momentum.

Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a regular press briefing when asked about the Fact Sheet on the National Endowment for Democracy released by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.  The fact sheet, with about 12,000 words in six sections, lays bare the true face of NED through hundreds of specific incidents gathered from public reports, Zhao said.  He said the United States has long used democracy as a tool and a weapon to undermine democracy in the name of democracy, to incite division and confrontation, and to meddle in other countries' internal affairs, causing catastrophic consequences.  "NED, as one of the U.S. government's main 'foot soldiers' and 'white gloves', has subverted lawful governments and cultivated pro-U.S. puppet forces under the pretext of democracy," Zhao said.  NED was seen behind color revolutions instigated and orchestrated by the United States, including the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the Arab Spring, Zhao said, adding that NED has been stirring up protests and demonstrations in Thailand, inciting the opposition parties in Nicaragua to seize power by force, funding anti-Cuba forces to manipulate public sentiment against the government, and long interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs through various means.  "Hellbent on disrupting the world, NED has not brought social stability and development or contented lives and good work to other countries. On the contrary, it has caused a host of issues including withered livelihood, languishing economy and social confrontation," Zhao said.  NED also extends its evil hand to China and invests heavily in anti-China programs every year to incite "Xinjiang independence," "Hong Kong independence," and "Tibet independence" activities by various means, said the spokesperson.  "It also colludes with 'Taiwan independence' forces and attempts to incite division and disrupt stability across the Taiwan Strait, which has been met with indignation and opposition from the Chinese people on both sides of the Strait," Zhao said.  Noting NED is actually the "second CIA" of the United States, Zhao said it is by no means an NGO that provides support for democracy abroad.  "We believe the international community will see its true face more and more clearly, and more countries will expose its ugly track record in various forms," said the spokesperson.  Noting peace and development remains the theme of our times, Zhao said those that meddle in other countries' domestic affairs are doomed to fail no matter what disguise they use.

Wang, as the special representative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, made the remarks via video link at a leaders' meeting on drought and sustainable land governance.  He said that since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, developing countries have faced severe challenges in their economies and people's livelihoods, and the task of coordinating development and environmental protection is arduous.  "Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and desertification and truly realizing the harmonious coexistence of man and nature requires the concerted efforts of the international community to find a better solution," Wang said.  He listed solutions in three areas, as suggested by the Chinese side.  First, international cooperation should be enhanced, Wang said, adding that developing countries, especially African countries, are facing more severe drought and desertification, and the international community should lend a helping hand.  Second, green development should be firmly promoted, he said. Food security, climate governance and green development are the key areas of cooperation in the Global Development Initiative proposed by President Xi, which calls for efforts to alleviate drought and achieve sustainable land governance. China welcomes the active participation of all parties, said Wang.  Third, international rules should be effectively improved, Wang said.  "We should actively respond to the drought issues that African countries are concerned about, continuously develop and improve drought-control rules, and build a fair and reasonable desertification-control system," he said.  Wang stressed that China is committed to jointly building a green Belt and Road, and through mechanisms such as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and South-South cooperation, China will work with African countries to promote the construction of a green Africa.

Their comments smeared the HKSAR's sixth-term chief executive election, the Chinese central government's policies towards Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's new electoral system, said a spokesperson for the office.  The spokesperson pointed out that John Lee's winning of the HKSAR's six-term chief executive election by an overwhelming majority of votes fully reflected the great support for him by Hong Kong society.  This successful election showed the new atmosphere under the new electoral system, displayed an upbeat mood of Hong Kong seeking unity and progress, and once again demonstrated the superiority of the new electoral system, the spokesperson said.  Noting that more than 1,400 representatives, elected by various sectors, cast their votes in the election, and they widely represented different industries and interest groups, the spokesperson said the election is a whole-process democratic practice that fits Hong Kong's reality and features Hong Kong characteristics.  The spokesperson said that the new electoral system of the HKSAR fully and faithfully implements the policy of "one country, two systems" and the HKSAR Basic Law, enforces the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," and develops quality democracy with Hong Kong characteristics.  The spokesperson pointed out that the so-called "democratic elections" in some Western countries are essentially "elite" elections and political shows in which money talks.  These countries only care about the election cycle, political party interests, and group interests, the spokesperson said.  "They know how to look good during campaigning but fail to govern effectively after being elected," the spokesperson said. "They don't have in mind the fundamental and long-term interests of their people, which usually result in short-sighted policies and inefficient governance."  Ignoring the structural deficiencies of their own democratic system and claiming to be "models of democracy," these pretentious countries are obsessed with pointing a finger at the democracy and human rights situation of others, and engaging in "wolf-pack tactics" to interfere in others' internal affairs, according to the spokesperson.  "We fully believe the patriotic governance team elected under the new electoral system will unite and lead all sectors of Hong Kong society to open a new chapter for the city, and Hong Kong will certainly embrace new glory at a new starting point," the spokesperson said.  "Any attempt to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will be in vain," the spokesperson stressed.  The office urged the G7 politicians to respect the historical trend, abide by the principles of international law such as non-interference in others' internal affairs and the basic norms governing international relations, discard ideological prejudices and hypocrisy, stop interfering in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs in any form, and no longer damage Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

The just-concluded election of the sixth-term chief executive of the HKSAR represents a new success of Hong Kong in developing democracy that is suitable to its own conditions, said a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council in a statement.  The winner of the election received widespread trust and support of the general public in Hong Kong, said the spokesperson, noting that the groundless accusations by some Western countries will never distort solid facts.  Certain politicians from a few Western countries have been pointing fingers at Hong Kong, which is nothing but an attempt to disrupt Hong Kong and contain China, said the spokesperson.  However, these nonsensical talks will never stop Hong Kong's turnaround from chaos to stability and prosperity, the spokesperson added. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Wang made the remarks when addressing the high-level virtual meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI).  Noting that more than 100 countries expressed support, and as many as 53 countries have joined the Group of Friends, Wang said it fully shows that the GDI responds to the call of the times and meets the needs of various countries.  Implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the biggest consensus on global development, Wang said, adding that it should therefore continue to be a priority on the international cooperation agenda.  Wang said all parties must honor their pledges and realize the 17 Sustainable Development Goals on schedule, oppose the politicization and marginalization of the development issue, continue to focus on the key areas most important to developing countries, and redouble efforts to raise living standards across the world.  Wang called for creating a favorable environment to accelerate global development, improving the global governance system at a faster pace, increasing the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries, and building an open world economy.  "It is important to uphold the right of people of all countries to choose their own development paths, and oppose interference in other countries' internal affairs and unilateral sanctions without basis in international law," Wang added.  On building an equal and balanced global development partnership, Wang said developed countries should fulfill their development assistance pledges and scale up support in financing and technology.  Developing countries need to deepen South-South cooperation and realize leapfrog development, Wang added, calling for more effective help from multilateral development institutions.  Wang also called on all parties to support UN in giving full play to its overall coordination function in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.  China will enhance consultation with other emerging markets and developing countries, and hold a high-level meeting on global development at a proper time to discuss ways to promote development, Wang said.  Wang also said that China will increase input in development, and further ramp up support for the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund and the China-UN Peace and Development Fund.  China will also build on the consensus to establish a pool of GDI projects to be participated by all parties, and release a Global Development Report in due time to promote international exchanges and sharing of development knowledge, Wang added.

Harish Chandra Shah, President of Nepal China Cultural and Educational Council, delivers a speech at an activity held by the council to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, March 2018.  Harish was voluble on topics about China. “I took all these photos in China. There is a story behind each of them,” he said, pointing at dozens of photos displayed in a bookcase in his office.  Harish, his father and children have all forged a special bond with China. “My father paid a visit to China when I was little. After he returned home, he told me that the Chinese people are kind and hospitable and that China is the most reliable and a true friend of Nepal, which greatly influenced me. I always wanted to visit China since I was young,” he said.    Harish Chandra Shah, President of&nbsp;Nepal China Cultural and Educational&nbsp;Council.  In 1977, then 20-year-old Harish went to study in China. In the following seven years, he lived and studied in Beijing, and toured Hebei and Sichuan provinces and other places in China, witnessing how China took its first steps in implementing reform and opening-up.  After he got back home, Harish chose a job that promotes friendly exchanges between Nepal and China. Because of his influence, Harish’s son and daughter also studied in China, and his wife has taught herself Mandarin. “Our family can speak with each other in fluent Mandarin,” Harish told People’s Daily.  Harish shared with the reporter his visit to a village in southwest China’s Yunnan province.  “In 2019, I took an investigation tour of a village near Kunming, capital city of Yunnan province, as a member of an investigation group. The local people have become better off by growing vegetables and flowers, some of which are sold to Malaysia and Indonesia. As the village speeds up development, new school, clinic and elderly care center have been built and residents have lived a better life,” Harish noted.  Harish learned from local residents that the village was really poor just a few years ago and that it has been with the help and under the guidance of resident officials sent to the village for poverty alleviation that the village has taken on a new look.

(Photo/Beijing Daily)  “When I was there, I felt villagers’ heartfelt support for these resident officials and for the Communist Party of China (CPC). Only such a political party that adheres to a people-centered approach and leads the people to a better life can be popular with and supported by the people,” Harish pointed out.  Three volumes of the English edition of “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China” were placed in a conspicuous spot in the bookcase in Harish’s office. The book series by Chinese President Xi Jinping have answers to all the questions related to the miracles in modern China, according to him.  “I joined in the translation of the book series into Nepali. During the process, I consulted a large number of materials, from which I gained a better understanding of the Chinese leader’s foresight in governance and how he always keeps the people close to his heart,” Harish said.  Harish pointed out that the lasting friendship between Nepal and China has been built on the basis of mutual respect and assistance.

(People’s Daily Online/Xie Jiang and Lu Wenkai)  After a major earthquake hit Nepal in 2015, China stood firmly with the Nepalese people in Nepal’s disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction. While overcoming difficulties and fulfilling its commitments to Nepal, China helped the latter achieve positive results in earthquake relief.  During the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, China has also lent a hand to Nepal and provided COVID-19 vaccines for the country just when it was in need of them.  “China has provided vaccines for and donated anti-epidemic supplies to us. Such timely and heart-warming help truly demonstrates the close friendship between our two countries,” Harish noted.  According to Harish, China has not only provided vaccines for other developing countries including Nepal to close the “immunization gap”, but carried out win-win cooperation with many other countries in the joint construction of the Belt and Road to stabilize global economic development and actively practice the idea of building a community with a shared future for mankind.  “I believe that with the joint efforts of the two governments and peoples, the Nepal-China friendship will bear more fruits,” he said.

Now 52, Huang is able to look back with satisfaction at what followed: a place at college and a career that has made good use of his skills and enthusiasm. He says he owes a great debt of thanks to the college principal who decided to enroll him at the time.  The principal who gave him "a new lease of life" was Xi Jinping.  Born in 1970 in the county of Minqing, east China's Fujian Province, Huang had both of his arms amputated after he accidentally touched a high-voltage wire. He stayed in hospital for over half a year, and after returning home, he felt everything had changed.  "All the joy had disappeared along with my arms," he recalled.  Huang went on to senior middle school, and officials at a local welfare institution offered him a job after graduation.  "However, deep in my heart, I still cherished a dream," he said. "I wanted to go to college and continue my studies."  He decided to carry on at school, writing with his feet, a practice that required him to go barefoot. Without shoes or socks, the winters were difficult. His feet turned "as red as carrots" in the cold air.  He took the college entrance exam in 1988 and 1989 but failed to gain admission on both occasions. Although Huang got decent scores in the exams, he was rejected due to his physical limitations. At that time, no universities or colleges enrolled students without arms.  Huang tried for a third time in 1990, but his past failures hung over him like a dark cloud. What he didn't know was that better times were just around the corner.  In that year, Xi took up the position of Communist Party of China (CPC) chief of the city of Fuzhou, Fujian's capital, as well as principal of Minjiang Polytechnic College (now known as Minjiang University). On learning of Huang's story, Xi decided to admit Huang on the basis of exceptional enrollment.  Huang thus became the first "armless student" in his college, and in the province.  Huang joined the CPC during the college years, and after graduation he became a staff member at the local disabled persons' federation in Minqing, aiming to help more people with disabilities embrace their "rebirth."  Over the years, Xi, as the country's top leader, has given "particular care and attention" to disabled people. He has pointed out that people with disabilities are equal members of the community as a whole, and has pushed for society-wide efforts to support them.  In 2016, during a visit to a paraplegic rehabilitation center in Tangshan, north China's Hebei Province, Xi talked with residents, saying, "If people with a sound physical condition can have a brilliant life, people with disabilities can do likewise."  During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), more than 60,000 students with disabilities were enrolled in higher-education institutions. In 2020, a total of 8.62 million people with disabilities were employed across the country. The government subsidizes over 400,000 handicapped people's vocational training annually.  Several years after his graduation, Huang met Xi at a local meeting to commend role models for disabled people and those who have made outstanding contributions in helping the disabled.  "I wanted to tell him in person of my gratitude for the college admission," Huang said. However, he was too shy to express his feelings.  "I decided instead to keep that thankfulness deep in my mind, and use it to drive the sense of responsibility in my work, and my devotion to the cause of helping disabled people," he said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has made various important remarks on that theme. The following are some highlights:  -- A family is the smallest unit of a nation while a nation is a myriad of families put together.  -- Parents should influence their children by precept and example. They should impart knowledge and foster children's virtues, helping their children establish moral values that steer them forward in their future adult life.  -- We should promote filial piety and family harmony, encourage people to take on family responsibilities, cultivate fine family traditions, and take care of the elderly.  -- Filial piety at home and loyalty to the country are among the fine traditions of the Chinese nation.  -- The prosperity and strength of the country and the rejuvenation of the nation must be ultimately reflected in the happiness of myriads of families and the continuous improvement of the lives of hundreds of millions of people.

They made the denouncement at a press briefing held Friday in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.  Cao Wei, an associate professor at Lanzhou University, said that out of fear of sanctions from the United States, some enterprises dare not employ workers of Uygur ethnicity, which will result in rising unemployment rate and declining living standards of the Uygur population.  Those anti-China politicians in the United States are the culprits who are depriving Xinjiang residents of their development opportunities under the guise of human rights, said Cao.  Ildos Murat, vice chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Xinjiang, said that in fact, the United States is the country where forced labor is still deeply rooted in the 21st century, with the immigrants being the main victims, and the U.S. government has evaded its obligations to protect them.  "According to research by academic institutions in the U.S., at least 500,000 people in the U.S. are subjected to modern-day slavery and forced labor," said Ildos Murat. "No matter how viciously anti-China forces in the U.S. smear Xinjiang over labor issues, they can never cover up the ironclad proof that the United States has violated labor rights."

In 1969, 15-year-old Xi was sent to Liangjiahe, a small rural village in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, as an "educated youth" -- urban youth sent to remote rural areas to "learn from farmers" during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). Upon learning this, his mother, Qi Xin, who was then working at a farm in central China's Henan Province, carefully made a sewing kit for him.  On the coarse cloth of the kit bag, Qi used red threads to stitch the words "niang de xin (mother's heart)" on it.  "From the threads a mother's hands weaves, a gown for parting son is made. Sown stitch by stitch before he leaves, for fear his return be delayed," Xi once quoted the poem "Song of the Parting Son" by Meng Jiao in Tang Dynasty (618-907) to explain how the Chinese tradition of strong family ties remains unchanged throughout history.  Xi kept the gift from his mother throughout the seven years he spent in Liangjiahe, where he overcame numerous challenges -- from the infestation of fleas and strenuous labor to perplexing challenges that required a great deal of thought. Xi learnt to do all kinds of farm work -- reclaiming wasteland, farming, hoeing, herding, hauling coal, mounding, and carrying manure -- and came to understand what reality, seeking truth and the masses meant. In his own words, Liangjiahe is the place where he "stepped out the first step of my life."  Meng's poem goes on to say "such kindness is like young grass that receives warmth from the vernal sun and can never be repaid," indicating the immense love the child owes to their parents.  As a filial son, Xi has always tried to spend time with his mother when possible. Despite a tight work schedule, he would always find time to go for a walk with her.  However, sometimes, for the sake of the greater good -- the interests of the people, he is unable to stay by her side, and Qi, in those cases, has always showed unwavering love and support for her son.  A TV documentary recorded a tender moment from 2001, where Xi, serving as the governor of east China's Fujian Province at the time, told his mother over the phone that he might not be able to make the family reunion during that year's Spring Festival.  "It doesn't matter if you come or not," Qi told him, "you doing your job well is the greatest piety for your father and mother... Son, I have thousands of thousands of words for you, but in one sentence, I hope you carry your responsibility, heavy as it may be, well."  At the end of the call, Qi said to Xi "I'll also give my best wishes to you, and wish you, Liyuan (Xi's wife)... and my little granddaughter a happy Spring Festival, a happy family life... and have all your dreams come true."  Xi often recalls a moment from when he was five or six years old, where Qi bought him picture books about Yue Fei, a patriotic military commander of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279). Qi would read to him the story of how Yue's mother tattooed four Chinese characters on Yue's back to remind him of devoting himself to the country: "Jing Zhong Bao Guo," or serving the country with total loyalty.  "Jing Zhong Bao Guo: I have long remembered these four characters. It is the pursuit of my entire life," Xi said, reaffirming his commitment to living up to the expectations of his mother, as well as the people of his motherland. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Following an apparently random yet violent murder of a young Korean-American woman in a Chinatown apartment here in February, mourners placed flowers, candles, photos, and cardboard signs condemning anti-Asian hatred around a tree outside the residential building where Christina Yuna Lee was stabbed to death.  While the shock of Lee's death had yet to wear off, mourners were outraged that the makeshift memorial for Lee had been repeatedly vandalized.  The temporary memorial was first vandalized in the middle of the night just three days after Lee's death, and it continued to be vandalized even in broad daylight.  "So five times last month, and it just keeps increasing. It is very sad," Brian Chin, Lee's former landlord, told Xinhua.  According to video clips from a surveillance camera shared by Chin, a man kicked at the flowers, candles, and signs in the early morning on March 2, and another pedestrian pulled down a cardboard sign about a week later.  Every attack on the memorial is pretty much anti-Asian and "it is very scary right now," said Chin, whose family came to the United States from China over 60 years ago.  "They're doing it with hate. They see her picture. They see the flowers and candles," Chin added.  Lee's tragic death followed the fatal shoving of Asian American Michelle Alyssa Go onto subway tracks by a man at Times Square station on Jan. 15 and the death of Yaopan Ma in January in a racially motivated attack in East Harlem.  "Her (Lee's) death is part of an alarming pattern of unchecked, hateful violence against women, namely women of Asian descent and women of color that can no longer stand without consequence," said one of Lee's relatives in an appeal on Gofundme.com.  For Chin, a middle-aged man, the continued anti-Asian hate crimes had brought about unprecedented depression.  "I think everyone is terrified right now that they will be attacked on the subways, on the streets, and then the guy will be out on the same day," he said.  According to Chin, this wave of anti-Asian hatred began with very vitriolic language which claims COVID-19 as the so-called "Chinese flu" or "Wuhan flu."  Kathleen Flynn-hui, whose husband originally came from Hong Kong, said that anti-Asian prejudice affects her family on a daily basis.  "We've kind of always felt it, but not as strongly as now," said Flynn-hui, adding that she "dealt with discrimination against my husband because he was Asian the whole time."  Chin said the situation is deteriorating due to a combination of politics, the impact of new laws, and the new Manhattan District Attorney's lenient stance on crime.  "The cops are doing their job, but they arrest them, and they're free the next day due to the laws," said Chin.  Right now, much stronger laws are needed to protect the Asian community, Chin said, calling on lawmakers, the city council, and the mayor to take stronger and more enforceable action.  The Committee of 100, a non-profit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans, recently called on U.S. elected officials, law enforcement, and responsible media to address racism, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders immediately with actionable and concrete results.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"To influence domestic policies in recipient countries ... the U.S. has provided assistance to serve its goals and achieve its interests," Ayman Okeil, general manager of the Cairo-based Maat for Peace, Development, and Human Rights, told Xinhua in a recent interview.  THE NED AS A PROXY  Among all the proxies Washington uses to serve its political agenda in other countries, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was founded in 1983 as a bipartisan, non-profit institution by the U.S. government, is one of the most active.  Nominally a non-governmental organization that provides support for democracy abroad, the NED in fact relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the U.S. Congress, and takes orders from the U.S. government.  Okeil described the NED as one of Washington's "soldiers" for interfering in other countries' decision-making process.  The NED has worked as a substitute for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cultivating pro-U.S. opposition activists for subverting lawful governments and provoking uprisings in the Arab countries under the pretext of promoting democracy, he said.  According to Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, the NED was founded as a tool for projecting political influence in different sovereign states that the U.S. government has labeled as "non-democratic, totalitarian, authoritarian and anti-American."  The NED supported opposition groups in other countries, which were trained to represent Washington's interest, rather than the vital interests of their own nations and states, Rawashdeh pointed out.  Echoing Rawashdeh's point, Okeil said that the NED has spent millions of U.S. dollars to support political parties, labor unions, dissident movements, and media in dozens of countries.  The organization has been employed as the "mastermind" behind separatist riots, color revolutions, and political crises around the world, with the aim of toppling legitimate governments and creating U.S. puppets in targeted countries, said Ahmad Ashqar, a Syrian journalist and political expert.  The NED makes sure that nations across the globe do what the United States wants them to do and in no way feel confident and capable of pursuing their own political/ideological agendas, Rawashdeh said. "And this is also what the U.S. foreign policy is doing for decades."  A NEW TYPE OF IMPERIALISM  The United States, unfortunately, has created a new type of imperialism, by occupying foreign countries with money and forces and interfering in their choice of leaders and party compositions, Okeil told Xinhua.  Unlike the funds that came from some countries like China, which help improve health, education and development sectors, the U.S. economic aid is always with conditions attached, he noted  Okeil's words are not groundless. According to a study by the American University in Cairo in November 2021, the NED has allocated more than 606 million dollars in "democracy assistance" to Egypt in the period between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the U.S. government provided 415 million dollars in economic assistance to Egypt, which includes 55 million dollars to support programs for promoting democracy.  However, as Tariq Fahmy, a political science professor at the Cairo University, noted, the U.S. mode of democracy has not been successful in the Middle East, and it contradicts many countries' unique conditions.  "We all saw the disgraceful role in provoking the Arab Spring via funding the protesters" under the cover of democracy and human rights, Fahmy said, explaining that such kind of imposed democracy couldn't breed stability.  After the Arab Spring, many people in the Middle East have started to see the real objectives behind the U.S. aid when knowing that Washington had a role in inciting the Arab Spring uprisings via supporting, training and funding young protesters, Okeil noted.  The U.S. model of democracy is not suitable for the world, and based on that model, the U.S. policies led to real crimes, Fahmy said.  It's a fact that the United States has distorted the positive meaning of democracy and emptied such a notion of anything useful and beneficial for other countries, Ashqar argued.  "We have seen several examples like in Syria, where the United States used democracy as a pretext to support separatist forces and radical ones to destabilize the legitimate government," he said. "The U.S. presence in Syria has achieved all but the so-called democracy."  "Under the pretext of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy, the U.S. has stolen key areas in Syria rich with oil and gas, do you call that democracy?" asked the Syrian journalist.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The fire broke out inside the building on Friday evening at 4:40 p.m. (local time) near the city's Mundka metro station, and the death toll became clear only by night.  Reports said the fire started from the first floor of the building at an office of a CCTV cameras and router manufacturing company.  Officials said the firefighting and rescue operations continued until early morning on Saturday. Police are yet to identify the deceased, and the injured have been admitted to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital.  Firefighters used heavy cranes to reach the top floor of the building, and 27 fire tenders were sent to contain the blaze when smoke surrounded the entire building.  Video clips showed people trying to escape the building using a rope and hanging from broken windows. Many people could be seen trying to jump to another building.  "There was only one staircase and because of that people could not go out. I think the building did not have a proper no objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department," Satpal Bhardwaj, divisional officer of the Delhi fire department told media.  Police said they have arrested the owners of the company, but the owner of the building who did not have safety clearance from the fire department is on the run.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed grief over the deaths in the fire.  "Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a tragic fire in Delhi. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery," Modi wrote on social media.  Chances of fire in Indian buildings are usually high as people often ignore safety standards vis-a-vis fire.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"Different countries and civilizations may prosper together on the basis of respect for each other, and seek common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences," he added.  Xi's remarks elaborated on "Xiconomics," or the economics philosophy of the Chinese president, demonstrating China's commitment to building a harmonious world, promoting common development and enhancing the common interests of mankind.  OPENING WIDER  "We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges," Xi said in his special address, giving insight into a world battered by both the COVID-19 pandemic and sluggish economic growth.  In the past two years, under the guidance of Xi's economic thought, China has struck a fine balance between pandemic control and economic development.  In 2020, China has emerged as the only major economy with positive growth. In 2021, its gross domestic product saw a year-on-year increase of 8.1 percent, contributing around a quarter to world economic growth and beating most market expectations. The country has also played a crucial and irreplaceable role in supporting the global supply chains.  Alexander Petrov, a professor at St. Petersburg State University, said China's success has proved that in a socialist market economy, it is possible to coordinate the efficiency of economic development and social governance, which is needed for global economic recovery in the post-pandemic era.  China has once again become one "driving force of the global economy," said Jochen Goller, president and CEO of BMW China, who spoke highly of China's concerted efforts and strong resilience in both successfully fighting against COVID-19 and boosting economic recovery.  China's steady growth has served as a stabilizer for the world economy amid the pandemic. It has been implementing a development philosophy featuring openness and cooperation, which helped strengthen global solidarity for economic recovery.  "Countries around the world should uphold true multilateralism. We should remove barriers, not erect walls. We should open up, not close off. We should seek integration, not decoupling. This is the way to build an open world economy," Xi said, urging countries worldwide to "make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, and to fully unleash the vitality of the world economy."  Humphrey Moshi, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam of Tanzania, said that "China has been on the front line of encouraging multilateralism among global countries, and it has been doing that through cooperation on the principles of a win-win situation."  "As a staunch supporter of globalization, China has been actively participating in and promoting international cooperation against COVID-19, providing medical equipment and COVID-19 vaccines to many countries," Moshi said.  "China stands ready to work with all countries to build an open world economy so that the spring breeze of openness will bring warmth to all parts of the world," Xi said at the opening ceremony of the fourth China International Import Expo in November 2021, reiterating China's resolve to open wider and with a high standard.  From shortening the negative list for foreign investment and improving the business environment to expanding institutional opening-up, China has honored its commitments by offering more opportunities to other countries, which injected fresh momentum into global economic recovery.  Honson To, chairman of KPMG China and Asia Pacific, said China has kept opening wider to the world, upheld and acted on multilateralism, as well as actively pushed for a more inclusive global cooperation, sending a positive signal that China is willing to work together with other countries for a better future.  BENEFIT FOR ALL  At a time when the international community is struggling to reduce the development gap and secure equal opportunities for all, China has offered its solution to the problem by underlining the people's desire for a happy life.  "No matter what difficulties may come our way, we must adhere to a people-centered philosophy of development, place development and livelihoods front and center in global macro-policies, realize the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build greater synergy among existing mechanisms of development cooperation to promote balanced development worldwide," Xi said at January's forum.  In the eyes of Raphael Tuju, secretary-general of Kenya's ruling Jubilee Party, this people-centered philosophy of development Xi emphasized is well manifested in the Chinese president's famous remarks that "for the good of my people, I will put aside my own well-being."  By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.  Its own people's well-being is not the only thing China cares about. As Xi noted, "on the road to the well-being of all mankind, no country or nation should be left behind."  From China's growth to inclusive and common development of countries worldwide, Xi's economic thought addresses the need of the development of mankind through a variety of cooperation frameworks, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  The Mombasa-Nairobi Railway is a mega project under the BRI. It boosted Kenya's economy by significantly improving freight transportation, brought substantial benefits to local people, and at the same time protected the local ecological environment.  This is the beginning of the transformation, which will create jobs, hope, opportunities and prosperity for all Kenyans, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said during a test ride of the railway.  Another landmark project of Belt and Road cooperation is the 1,035-km China-Laos Railway, which has opened the landlocked country in Southeast Asia and connected it to markets as far away as in Europe since the railway's operation on Dec. 3, 2021.  Sommad Pholsena, vice president of the National Assembly of Laos, said while China was not the first country to express a willingness to build a railway in Laos, it was the only one to turn it into reality.  Xi's proposal to enhance interconnectivity and promote common development provides an opportunity for cooperation among developing countries, Pholsena said.  According to the World Bank, BRI transport projects could, by 2030, help lift 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million people out of moderate poverty globally.  "The more we study the BRI and witness its continuous advancement, the more we can appreciate the vision and the wisdom of President Xi's economic thought on world development," said former Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf.  DEVELOPMENT FOR GOOD  To tackle global challenges and seek sustainable development, the Chinese president has been promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.  Mankind was presented with two choices -- one is vicious competition or even armed conflict for power and self-interest, which may well lead to a disastrous crisis, Xi said when addressing the CPC (the Communist Party of China) in Dialogue with the World Political Parties High-Level Meeting in 2017.  "The other is for us to go along with the tide of the times and rise to challenges through global collaboration," he said. "This, in turn, will create favorable conditions for building a community with a shared future for mankind."  For Khalid Taimur Akram, executive director of the Center for Global and Strategic Studies in Islamabad, the notion of building a community with a shared future for mankind bears significance for today's global development.  China has provided a platform for all to turn this vision into reality, as the international community is searching for ways to advance cooperation and resolve differences, Akram said.  In his speech in September 2021 at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly via video, Xi said "we must revitalize the economy and pursue more robust, greener and more balanced global development. Development holds the key to people's well-being."  He then urged countries around the world to "work together to steer global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth," and proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) to this end.  Speaking highly of the GDI, Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Liberata Mulamula said the pandemic serves as a reminder that the world is a community and no country should be left behind.  Since Xi brought up the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind in 2013, China has been enriching it to reflect the hope of people from all countries for a better world.  "We should follow the trend of history, work for a stable international order, advocate common values of humanity, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We should choose dialogue over confrontation, inclusiveness over exclusion, and stand against all forms of unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony or power politics," Xi said at the WEF meeting in January.  The notion of a community with a shared future is the right path for human development, which could help reduce global inequality, said Ronnie Lins, director of the China-Brazil Center for Research and Business.  The Chinese president's philosophy is of profound theoretical significance, said Maxim Rybachuk, leading researcher at the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  "We are talking about development concepts such as inclusive growth and dual circulation that have benefited both the Chinese people and people in other countries," Rybachuk said.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The fire broke out at around 4:40 p.m. local time in the building located near the Mundka metro station in outer Delhi.  "A total of 16 bodies were recovered from the three-storey commercial building which had caught fire this evening near Delhi's Mundka metro station," Atul Garg, director of the Delhi fire service, told local media.  According to Garg, the third floor of the building was yet to be searched.  Police officials said the death toll was likely to rise as many people were feared trapped in the building.  "Rescue operation is underway in the building," a police official said.  Officials said 24 fire tenders were at the spot to contain the blaze.  "It's a massive fire and heavy cranes are being used to go up and douse the fire," a fire service official said.  The cause of the fire is not immediately known. However, reports said the fire started from the first floor of the building which hosts an office of a CCTV camera and router manufacturing company.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Ren Chao)  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- As of Friday, the worldwide count of COVID-19 cases has exceeded 520 million, with over 6 million related deaths.  As the world is plagued by major challenges, not least a pandemic unseen in a century, Chinese President Xi Jinping has on multiple occasions called on the international community to take concerted actions against the virus.  The following are some highlights of his remarks on how cooperation can help the world survive.  April 21, 2022  In his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, Xi stressed that we need to work together to defend people's lives and health.  For humanity to clinch a final victory against the COVID-19 pandemic, more hard efforts are needed. It is essential that countries support each other, better coordinate response measures and improve global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic, said Xi.

(Rouelle Umali/Xinhua)  Jan. 17, 2022  At the virtual session of the 2022 World Economic Forum, Xi pledged to embrace cooperation on jointly overcoming the pandemic and champion economic globalization.  As COVID-19 is resurging with more variants and spreading faster than before, Xi stressed the importance of fully leveraging vaccines as a powerful weapon and ensuring the equitable distribution of vaccines to close the global immunization gap.  Xi called on countries to strengthen international cooperation against COVID-19, carry out active cooperation on the research and development of medicines, jointly build multiple lines of defense against the coronavirus, and speed up efforts to build a global community of health for all.  Dec. 31, 2021  China has provided 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations for the global COVID response, Xi said in his 2022 New Year Address.  "Only through unity, solidarity and cooperation can countries around the world write a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind," he said.

On fighting COVID-19 with solidarity, Xi stressed the need to truly ensure the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in Africa.  Oct. 31, 2021  While addressing the 16th G20 Leaders' Summit via video link, Xi said that at present, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered multiple crises.  The development achievements made by the international community over the years have been seriously eroded and developing countries are facing unprecedented challenges and tests, Xi pointed out.  The COVID-19 pandemic has once again shown that all countries, with high stakes in each other's future and converging interests, form a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi said, noting that promoting sustainable development in developing countries will benefit the people of the countries concerned, and also affect the future and destiny of the whole mankind and the Earth.  Sept. 24, 2021  While delivering a speech via video at the opening ceremony of the 2021 Zhongguancun Forum, Xi called on all countries to strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology.  Xi noted that nowadays profound changes unseen in a century are evolving rapidly in the world and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far-reaching, presenting severe challenges for the recovery of the global economy.  All countries in the world need to strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology, explore ways and means of jointly solving important global issues through sci-tech innovation, address the challenges of the times together, and promote the noble cause of peace and development for all, said Xi.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  *The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements.   *The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House is peddling its so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" against China and ramping up its pressure campaign of the Russia-Ukraine conflict during a two-day summit in Washington with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  But its hope to pull ASEAN members into its camp will shrivel, as ASEAN countries have already woken up to Washington's typical hegemony, hypocrisy and egomania.  The arrangement of the summit itself has laid bare Washington's double-dealing nature. Its disrespect for ASEAN members concerning scheduling issues despite its pledge of "enduring commitment" has sparked a wave of complaints among ASEAN members, resulting in a postponement of the summit from late March to May.  Cambodian Minister attached to the Prime Minister Kao Kim Hourn said before the summit that if Washington was serious about improving its ties with ASEAN, it should have arranged bilateral meetings between the United States and ASEAN countries. ASEAN leaders "should be treated with respect and equality," he noted.  The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements. The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  Many sober minds in ASEAN have seen through this duplicity and bullying. Indonesia and Malaysia warned that AUKUS could lead to a major arms race in the region. A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."

(Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)  Meanwhile, the White House will attempt in vain during this summit to talk ASEAN into imposing sanctions against Russia. Ever since the escalation of the current Ukraine crisis, Washington has been trying to exert pressure on ASEAN to take sides, but most of ASEAN members did not follow suit.  On April 7, six of the 10-member bloc abstained from voting in favor of a resolution to remove Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and two voted against it. Long adhering to an independent foreign policy, ASEAN members have urged solving the crisis through negotiation and dialogue.  Moreover, some ASEAN members have been well aware of Washington's unspoken calculations to turn bloody sufferings of others into golden opportunities for profits in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during his visit to China in early April, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said he appreciates China's objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, that "Asian countries should maintain peace and stability in the region, jointly resist unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law, and prevent attempts to create tensions and replicate crises in the region."  Playing small clique politics and forcing others to take sides -- Washington's old tricks to gain geopolitical interests -- work against ASEAN's will to uphold regional peace and stability and to realize sustainable economic development. Launching trade wars and breaking pacts -- Washington's classical acts of unilateralism -- severely disrupt normal trade exchanges and supply chains in the region and deal a heavy blow to ASEAN's economy. All those wrongdoings have tarnished Washington's credit and influence as the world's sole superpower, and driven it further apart from ASEAN members.  The long arc of history teaches each and every country that acting without scruples almost always results in the reverse of what one desires. It is time for Washington to learn this lesson, abandon its old dream of Cold War hegemony, uphold an open and inclusive mindset, and play its due role in maintaining regional and global peace, stability and development.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The country's renewed calls for infrastructure investment were reiterated at recent high-profile meetings chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission.  During the meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs on April 26, Xi, also head of the committee, urged all-out efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction in the country's endeavor toward a modern infrastructure system.  From traditional infrastructures, such as water conservancy and transportation networks, to the new infrastructures led by cloud computing and artificial intelligence platforms, the meeting discussed a wide range of infrastructure development topics and gave full consideration to the various needs related to China's future development.  Later that week, on April 29, a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, chaired by Xi, reiterated the need to comprehensively reinforce infrastructure construction.  These high-level announcements made during the two consecutive meetings highlighted the pivotal role of infrastructure in the national economy, said Sun Chuanwang, a professor at Xiamen University.  The moves will further stimulate investment potential in the infrastructure sector and bring opportunities for the relevant industries and enterprises, Sun added.  A flurry of pledges to ensure solid implementation followed. The Ministry of Transport, for instance, planned to advance infrastructure investment with a moderately proactive approach. Meanwhile, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) urged to expand infrastructure investment in the fields of industrial upgrades, urban and rural construction and national security.  Infrastructure serves as a pillar for economic and social development. Under Xi's leadership, China has made great advances in infrastructure construction, ranging from water conservancy and transportation projects, to information infrastructure, with the overall level improving in leaps and bounds.  Concerned about people's well-being in border areas, Xi urged efforts to advance the construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway project with high quality, in an instruction made ahead of the construction of the Ya'an-Nyingchi section of the railway in November 2020.  Describing the project as a vital step in facilitating the Party's general plan for governing Tibet in the new era, he stressed the project's important role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.  A few months later, aboard a train from Nyingchi Railway Station to the regional capital Lhasa, Xi inspected the construction along the railway and hailed the railway as a major move to boost Tibet's development and improve people's living standards.  With the country's modernization drive high on his agenda, Xi met with the main scientists and project leaders of China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, during his inspection trip in southwest China's Guizhou Province in February last year.  Noting that the FAST is a major national scientific and technological infrastructure, Xi stressed the importance of science and technology in China's pursuit of building a modern socialist country.  In addition to leveraging infrastructure investment to spur economic growth in the short term, China has also been striving to build technological and digital infrastructure as a part of its long-term goal to optimize the overall economic layout.  As part of the digital information infrastructure, the number of 5G base stations in the country increased by 81,000 during the first quarter of the year, bringing the total to over 1.5 million.  In the country's latest steps to ride the digitalization wave amid a surge of demand for computing capacity, China initiated works earlier this year on a mega project to establish eight national computing hubs and 10 national data center clusters in a bid to improve overall computing power and resource efficiency.  "Computing power has already become an important infrastructure for the national economic development," the NDRC stated on its website, estimating China's demand for computing power to surge by over 20 percent annually in the coming years.  As the Chinese economy enters into its critical stage of transformation and upgrading, a modern infrastructure system with a focus on shoring up weak links and fostering new growth drivers will lay a solid foundation for the country's medium and long-term development, said Fan Ruoying, a researcher with the Bank of China.  Looking ahead, efforts should be made to improve cross-regional and cross-department coordination in organizing infrastructure investment, lift restrictions on market access for private enterprises, and further innovate investment and financing methods, Fan noted.

President Xi Jinping quoted this line from an ancient Chinese poem to encourage young Chinese to strive for progress.  The poem was written by Fan Peng, a Chinese poet in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, cited the line while addressing a ceremony held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) on Tuesday.  Speaking at the ceremony on Tuesday, Xi called on CYLC members to be models of hard work and dedication, take the lead in remaining committed to standing on the side of the people, and be realistic, pragmatic, and down-to-earth.  Realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is a relay race of history in which today's young people should strive for excellent performance, said Xi, adding that the times have always endowed young people with historical responsibilities.  "We believe a nation will be strong only when its young people are strong and a nation will make progress only when its younger generations make progress," said Xi. "We have always believed that the future of our nation rests on youths."  The CYLC was founded on May 5, 1922, under the direct leadership of the CPC. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Xi shared her story during a speech at a meeting of the United Nations (UN) in 2020, expressing his admiration for medical workers, including nurses.  Liu was among the 40,000-plus health workers from across the country who rushed to the central province of Hubei in 2020 when it was fighting a fierce battle against the COVID-19 epidemic.  "The moment I put on the protective suit, I am not a kid anymore." -- Xi cited Liu's words from a TV interview when she was told by a journalist that she is still very young, and needs to be taken care of.  "Those words moved the whole nation," Xi said while sharing Liu's story at the meeting marking the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.  Coming from the city of Huizhou, Guangdong Province, about 1,000 km south of Hubei's capital Wuhan, Liu was the youngest member of the medical-assistance team dispatched by the province to assist with Wuhan's fight against the novel coronavirus.  She volunteered to join the team during the Lantern Festival in February 2020. It was the furthest distance she had ever traveled from home, and the month she spent there was the longest time she had ever been away from her parents.  At the UN meeting, Xi spoke highly of Liu and medical workers like her, saying "their courage and hard work have shown the very best of the medical profession" and "their devotion and sacrifice have kept the nation intact through difficult times."  At a time when multiple Chinese cities are battling a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, a large number of nurses again threw themselves into the battle without hesitation.  "They proved worthy of the great trust placed in them," as Xi rightly said in his greetings to nurses in 2020 ahead of International Nurses Day, which falls on May 12.  The number of registered nurses in China had reached 5.02 million at the end of 2021, and there were about 3.56 nurses for every 1,000 people, according to official statistics.  Xi hailed them for exemplifying the noble spirit of respecting and protecting life, healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, and being dedicated to the cause, and asked governments at all levels to care about nurses, focus more efforts on strengthening the nursing workforce, and improve the incentive mechanisms.  Nursing is an important part of health care, Xi noted, calling on all members of society to show their appreciation and support for nurses. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Xi pointed out that since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties 30 years ago, China and Slovenia, treating each other with respect and as equal, have achieved positive results in mutually beneficial cooperation and witnessed increasing cultural and people-to-people exchanges, which brings tangible benefits to the people of the two countries.  In the face of COVID-19, the people of the two countries have supported each other, demonstrating the profound friendship between China and Slovenia, he said.  Xi stressed that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Slovenia relations, saying that he is ready to work with Pahor to take the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties as a new starting point, seize the historic opportunity of jointly building the Belt and Road, strengthen the alignment of development strategies of the two sides, and deepen practical cooperation, so as to inject new impetus into the development of bilateral relations for the benefits of the two countries and their people.  In his message, Pahor earnestly congratulated China on its leapfrog development in various fields, saying that bilateral relations between Slovenia and China enjoy a long history and have seen rapid development since diplomatic ties were established 30 years ago.  He added that economic and trade cooperation has been fruitful and the fields of cooperation are growing, among which ice and snow sports have become a new highlight of cooperation.  As a member of the European Union, Slovenia actively supports enhancing Europe-China relations and is committed to delivering the fruits of cooperation to both sides and the international community, said the president.

(Graphic: Zero-sum or zero-carbon/People's Daily Online)  The Glasgow climate summit held last year was largely viewed as a chance for redemption. After the grim outcome of the (2°C) mitigation target set at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, humanity's "last chance" to save the planet, nations were nudged to give climate cooperation another shot. Few world leaders are more zealous and vocal on the matter than US president Joe Biden, who has proposed a portfolio of ambitious goals and called for joint collaboration between major players and, in particular, the US and China.  Then, last February, in a surprise move, the Biden administration announced that it would extend the Trump-era Section 201 tariffs slapped on solar panels, in a bid to "continue facilitating positive adjustment to competition" from imported photovoltaic cells. Though the administration did offer some clues on the "positive adjustment," almost four years after the tariffs were levied, experts argued that America's solar industry remained nascent in its development despite full-blown trade barriers and that the decision came at an emissions cost.  In an opinion essay published earlier this month in The Hill, John Paul Helveston, an American researcher, debated that tariffs won't help the US build a "robust solar industry." He contended that China's tremendous R&amp;D efforts on photovoltaic (PV) innovations, which helped slash the prices of most PV panels from $2,000 per kilowatt to just $300 per kilowatt, cannot be simply duplicated. It is highly unlikely that another nation will be able to "replicate China's skills in the time frame needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change," he cited an article he co-wrote in Science back in 2019, adding, "Rather than continuing the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese solar panels, the US and others should be partnering with Chinese firms to obtain low-cost technologies and components to increase domestic deployment of renewables as fast as possible to meet the narrow window left to decarbonize."  Low-cost solar technologies and components, however, have been the very items subject to Washington's ongoing investigation.  The New York Times reported on April 29 that, amidst an investigation by the US Commerce Department targeting Chinese-made PV parts, the US solar industry has been "frozen," with over 300 solar projects being "canceled or delayed." American energy enterprises, big and small, have all been dragged into the quagmire of self-censorship over Chinese solar parts. "The investigation is having a catastrophic negative impact on the renewable energy sector and driving up electricity prices. With each day the tariff investigation continues, the country is falling further behind in achieving our climate goals," said Nick Bullinger, COO of a Chicago-based solar company, in an interview that appeared in the Times article.    U.S. President Joe Biden (R) speaks during an event, at the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, on May 9, 2022. Biden said that the administration is "discussing" whether to drop hiked tariffs on Chinese products. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  From the perspective of environmental benefits or from the standpoint of economic interests, Washington's 4-year-long-and-counting solar clampdown is cost-ineffective, as it collides with even Biden's own climate agenda.  US president Joe Biden attended the Glasgow summit with high hopes—100% renewable energy by 2035; but the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), an NGO, estimated that America's current production capacity only makes up 15% of its demand. Neither will taxing and purging Chinese solar panels or PV parts help "bring jobs back home," since even with heavy tariffs the US remains heavily dependent on imported PV products.  Besides, the volume of jobs generated by solar installations in the US is ten times larger than the manufacturing jobs created by the nation's entire solar sector, according to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). As a letter sent to President Biden last January by eight American senators (from both parties) stated, the Section 201 tariffs had "led to the loss of more than 62,000 American clean energy jobs and 10.5 gigawatts of foregone solar deployment." It is difficult then to tell who the tariffs and investigation are designed to punish: overseas solar producers or the American labor force?    Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  But it's not hard to detect what formula is being applied in America's zero-carbon solution—its default zero-sum fixation. After all, the one-nation's-gain-representing-another's-loss mindset takes various shapes in the China-US relations from Washington's point of view.  On the global stage, it is reflected in Washington's unreasonable belief that China's global presence, such as donating COVID-19 vaccines to developing nations, will undermine the superpower's global influence.  In the economic sphere, it is manifested in America's obsession with punitive tariffs, which it deems will help reverse trade deficits and boost domestic industry, even though the burden will ultimately be shifted towards American consumers in the form of rising prices.  In the technological and academic realms, it is showcased in America's year-long crackdown on Chinese tech companies and its unjustified witch-hunt targeting Chinese academics and students.  ... ...  The aforementioned aspects of Washington's zero-sum practices are epitomized by its now-stagnant solar industry, which in turn has demonstrated why such a mindset won't work. Internationally, it will risk hindering the joint cause of emissions reduction; economically, it will impede the low-hanging fruits and long-term benefits brought by the should-be full-fledged solar sector; and, from the perspectives of innovation and technological progress, it will further dampen the outlook of cooperation on green innovations.

(Xinhua/Liu Lei)  Dwelling on a planet that is currently plagued by a global pandemic (accompanied by inflation and a possible recession), haunted by continuous wars and conflicts, and overshadowed by the looming threat of global warming, we all know that a zero-sum fixation and a Cold-War mindset won't help fix any of these global problems. On the contrary, they are destined to make the planet warmer, wars deadlier, and other global puzzles more insoluble.  For Washington, it needs to face the reality that it cannot achieve technological hegemony or climate leadership by setting up a new Iron Curtain to deter and isolate China. Returning to a rational and pragmatic China policy is the sole way to nurture healthy and sustainable China-US ties and encourage the two sides to work together on issues of common and global concern. Conversely, the zero-sum mindset is bound for a lose-lose path.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Adhering to the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind, China continued to play a vital role in global growth, development and security while promoting authentic multilateralism, rejecting a Cold-War mentality, and maintaining a policy of non-interference, Farhat Asif, president of the Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies, an Islamabad-based think-tank, told Xinhua in a recent interview.  "There is a lot more potential in the new initiative ... providing a vision of comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security will help the countries who would be part of the initiative to grow further in a secure and peaceful environment," the expert said.  Asif said that China has been working on global economic development and launched several initiatives, including the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Global Development Initiative, which have enabled people across the world to reap the benefits of win-win cooperation. After all, sustainable peace and security are based on prosperity.  More than 140 countries of different religions, cultures, languages and socio-economic statuses are part of the BRI, showing inclusiveness and a harmonious relationship between them, she said.  The expert noted that the Global Security Initiative proposed by China is more people-centric which seeks safety and security for everyone in the world as opposed to some Western countries' unilateral pursuit of their own safety based on hegemonic designs.  The containment and Cold-War mentality of the West has severely undermined global peace and security, creating a grim humanitarian crisis and security challenges internationally, she said.  The recent Russia-Ukraine conflict is a "classic example" in this case which arose when certain groups of countries ignore security demands of other countries while ensuring absolute security for themselves, the expert said, adding that "there is a requirement for these countries to opt for dialogue and diplomacy instead of fueling it further."  The expert said that technological innovations and the development of social media have strengthened interconnection and interdependence among countries. The world has become a global village that needs real multilateralism and enhanced cooperation rather than unilateralism to combat challenges, including the pandemic, climate change and food security.  As the security of one country is linked with the security of another, the new initiative proposed by China, which is more focused on human development and security, will allow an inclusive participation of every country, she said.

Facing complex changes in the international landscape and various challenges to world peace and development, the leaders of the two countries have been guiding bilateral relations from a high level, providing valuable momentum for greater China-Germany and China-EU cooperation.  Today, peace and development are under threat due to rampant hegemonism and exacerbated global divisions. The onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has reignited the flames of war in Europe.  Such an alarming increase in threats to global security and development has led to an urgent call for more stability and certainty in navigating these turbulent times.  In his meeting with Scholz, Xi said that under the current circumstances, it is particularly important for the two countries to maintain sound and steady growth of bilateral ties and better harness the stabilizing, constructive and steering role of this relationship.  This not only serves the interests of the Chinese and German peoples but will also contribute significantly to world peace and tranquility, he said.  There is no change in China's commitment to developing ties with Germany; there is no change in China's sincere wish for closer cooperation with Germany; and there is no change in China's conviction that China and Germany can make greater differences together, Xi emphasized.  These remarks shed light on the value and significance of China-Germany relations, pointing the way to future cooperation and dialogue between the two countries.  Meanwhile, past achievements have laid a solid foundation for the steady development of China-Germany relations. In the past five decades since the two countries established diplomatic ties, the bilateral relationship has shown great vitality, endurance, resilience and potential.  While Germany is China's most important trading partner in Europe, China has been Germany's top trade partner for six consecutive years. The trade volume between them has mushroomed to more than 250 billion U.S. dollars in 2021 from less than 300 million dollars at the very beginning of diplomatic relations.  Nearly 60 percent of German companies in China reported improved business operations last year, and 71 percent plan further investment in the country, according to a report released by the German Chamber of Commerce in China and KPMG.  As for the question of how China and Germany manage to develop together and contribute to each other's success, Xi offered an appropriate answer: It is essentially attributable to a commitment to mutual respect and win-win cooperation, a valuable piece of experience and important principle that should be upheld all along.  There is immense potential remains for the two countries to enrich their relations and deepen their mutually beneficial cooperation regarding climate change, macroeconomic policy, environmental protection, services trade, AI and digitalization.  In addition, China is speeding up its efforts to foster a new development paradigm, which means broader market opportunities for Germany and all other countries.  Xi called on the two sides to stand for true multilateralism, uphold international fairness and justice, defend the UN's central role in international affairs, safeguard basic norms governing international relations, promote an open world economy, and make global development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive.  He also expressed his hope for Germany's active support for and participation in the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, with a view to building a community with a shared future for mankind.  Since Germany is a pivotal country in the EU, the continent's security is closely associated with Germany. Notably, the ongoing Ukraine crisis has pushed European security to a crossroads.  On this issue, China always stands on the side of peace and makes its conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter, working in its own way to promote peace and defuse tensions.  Xi has emphasized during that meeting: "It is important to make every effort to prevent the conflict from intensifying or magnifying to a point of no return."  For that purpose, the European side needs to show historical responsibility and political wisdom, bear in mind the long-term stability of Europe, and promote a solution in a responsible manner, Xi said, stressing that the security of Europe should be kept in the hands of Europeans themselves.  China's appeal for peace and stability has been widely welcomed in Europe and beyond. When reporting on the video meeting, many European media outlets, including Reuters, headlined Xi's call to prevent the Ukraine conflict from intensifying, fully reflecting how the international community supports China's take on this issue.  In an unsettled international situation, sound and steady growth in China-EU relations remains more crucial than ever.  The China-Europe relationship is not targeted at, subjugated to, or controlled by any third party, which is a strategic consensus that both sides must follow in the long run, Xi said.  Therefore, Xi highlighted the importance for China and the EU, with a dialectical and long-term view, with mutual respect and with the right perception, to increase communication and enhance mutual trust.  Deepening China-Germany and China-EU cooperation will serve the interest of both sides and even the whole world. By adhering to mutual respect, openness and inclusiveness; seeking common ground while reserving differences; and cooperating for win-win results, China-Germany and China-EU relations will indeed ride the wave of uncertainty towards a brighter future.

The 2022 China-Europe Seminar on Human Rights was held both online and offline on Tuesday, with separate venues in the Austrian capital of Vienna and the central Chinese city of Wuhan.  More than 100 human rights scholars, officials and representatives from international organizations attended the seminar, themed "Science and Technology and Human Rights."  Heinz Fischer, former Austrian president and president of the Austria-China Friendship Association (ACFA), told Xinhua on the sidelines of the seminar that he had visited China many times since the 1970s and witnessed the country's rapid socio-economic development and progress in human rights cause.  Fischer said China has transformed into a "highly industrialized" and "high-tech" country in decades.  "This is incomparable. This is very impressive," he added.  Hannes Fellner, a linguistics professor at the University of Vienna, said that China's poverty alleviation campaign, which lifted "hundreds of millions of people in China out of poverty," is "one of the greatest human rights feats in the history of humankind."  China has also succeeded in advancing the human rights cause with the help of science and technology, Fellner added.  Delegates at the seminar also applauded the seminar as an important platform to promote dialogue and mutual understanding on human rights issues between China and Europe.  Although China and Europe may have different approaches to human rights, "it is necessary to exchange opinions in such a seminar with high-ranking participants," said Fischer.  Gerd Kaminski, standing vice president of the ACFA, said the seminar helps promote dialogue on an equal basis and improve mutual understanding.  Chinese Ambassador to Austria Li Xiaosi told Xinhua that China and Europe have both attached great importance to the seminar since its inauguration in 2015.  Experts, scholars and officials from both sides have participated actively in the event and engaged in constructive dialogue to find consensus, which is conducive to the joint efforts to promote human rights development, Li said.

The younger generation, according to Xi, should do their best to help realize national rejuvenation -- the greatest dream of the Chinese people since the Opium War of 1840.  Overseas Chinese youth said that they will carry forward their dreams and missions, and forge ahead on the new journey to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.  Lan Tianzhang, deputy captain of the political work of the 20th Chinese peacekeeping engineering detachment to Lebanon, said the young peacekeepers in Lebanon have been taking concrete actions to fulfill their missions and safeguard world peace, adding that they will work hard to make more contributions to realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  Wang Xiaowei, manager of the fifth site office of the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway invested by the China Road and Bridge Corporation, said they, as young workers serving the Belt and Road Initiative, feel proud of their mission and are more aware of the responsibilities of the young generation, adding that they will take roots in the frontline to ensure that the project becomes a high-quality one.  Wang Yuqing, a Chinese teacher at the Confucius Institute at the University of Karachi in Pakistan, said that Xi's words greatly encouraged young teachers working at overseas Confucius Institutes and gave them the confidence to do a better job of telling China's stories.  Miao Danying, a lecturer at the United Nations Visitors Service at Nairobi, said that an increasing number of Chinese people are serving in the United Nations and young faces are constantly emerging, showcasing Chinese culture and contributing Chinese talent in different positions.  Miao believed that with the continuous development of China, the prospects for Chinese youth to realize their dreams will be even broader.  Xia Yang, president of the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars in Japan, said that they must study hard and return home as soon as possible to contribute to China's development and prosperity as well as the rejuvenation of the nation.  Li Feng, who is about to finish his studies at the University of Zagreb in Croatia soon and return to China, pledged to be a young person with lofty ideals and firm convictions, and contribute to the development and prosperity of the country.

From April 3 to May 2, Muslims of various ethnic groups in the region observed Ramadan. They celebrated Eid al-Fitr, which fell on May 3, while enjoying a one-day holiday, said Xu Guixiang, spokesperson for the regional government, during a video conference on Tuesday.  Memet Juma, hatip of the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar Prefecture, said that prayers visited the 550-year-old mosque every day, and thousands of people of different ethnic groups performed their traditional dances on the square in front of the mosque.  Noting that Xinjiang is home to various ethnic groups and religious beliefs, Zumrat Obul, head of the regional united front work department, said that all normal religious activities are protected by law.  In recent years, there has been great misunderstanding about the religious situation in Xinjiang, and the United States in particular has groundlessly claimed that religious freedoms are restricted in Xinjiang.  "These ridiculous lies run completely counter to the facts," Xu said.  "We would like to go on telling Xinjiang's true stories to the international community," Xu said. "We are also looking forward to welcoming more visitors to Xinjiang who can witness the prosperous and comfortable life here." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese leadership has once again underscored what role the youth should play in the nation's rejuvenation drive.  In a speech on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged members of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) to be responsible, have firm convictions and work hard as the 73.7 million-strong organization celebrated its centenary.  The younger generation, according to Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, should do their best to help realize national rejuvenation -- the greatest dream of the Chinese people since the Opium War of 1840.  The destiny of any generation is closely connected with the era they live in. The youth have more opportunities to achieve their dreams when they chime with the cause of the Party and the people.  The pursuit of the Chinese Dream is a relay race. Since completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects in 2021, China has now embarked on a new journey -- building a great modern socialist country in all respects by the mid-21st century.  Standing at a new historical juncture, Chinese youth in the new era should take on their responsibility, and they will be blessed with a spacious and promising platform.  In his speech, Xi urged youth league members to "always stand on the high ground of ideals and convictions."  Ideals and convictions serve as a beacon for life and pursuits. They determine a person's position and direction. Young people need to observe society, reflect on life, and create a future on the strength of wisdom.  Xi said they should aim high at an early age and cultivate the trust in the Party, the confidence in socialism with Chinese characteristics and the belief in Marxism from the bottom of their heart.  The importance of hard work was also highlighted by Xi.  The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no easy task. It will not be achieved by simply "beating drums and gongs." Daunting challenges are inevitable in this new journey.  Chinese youth in the new era must work hard. Xi said the younger generation is the most energetic and enterprising and the least conservative force in society. The cause of the Party and the people could not have developed without the arduous dedication made by generations of young people.  Chinese youth will always be the vanguard force in realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and meeting challenges in a world undergoing changes unseen in a century.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday hailed the contributions made by young communists over the past century, and called on them to offer energy and creativity to push forward national rejuvenation.  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while addressing a ceremony held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC).  Founded in 1922, the CYLC has closely followed the Party's lead and written a "youthful chapter" in the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Xi said.  The ceremony, broadcast from the Great Hall of the People to a national audience, was presided over by Wang Huning, and attended by Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng.

Young people must play a vanguard role and closely follow the Party, He said.  IMPORTANT FEATS  In his speech, Xi enumerated the contributions made by CYLC members in the past 100 years.  League members have accomplished important feats in the victory of the Chinese revolution, the development of the motherland, reform and opening up and socialist modernization, as well as in securing historic achievements and shifts in the cause of the Party and the country in the new era, Xi said.  The CYLC has proven itself to be the vanguard of the Chinese youth movement, he noted.  Using past experience as an outline for the CYLC in the future, Xi said the League achieved success because it upheld the leadership of the Party, reinforced faith in communism and socialism, committed itself to national rejuvenation, and remained rooted in Chinese youth.  Chinese youth in the new era, blessed with a spacious and promising platform, should also shoulder important responsibilities, Xi said.  The pursuit of the Chinese Dream is a relay race, Xi said, adding that young Chinese today should strive to excel in contributing to national rejuvenation.

(Xinhua/Yue Yuewei)  PARTY'S "SCHOOL" AND "BRIDGE"  On his expectations for the CYLC, Xi said the League should educate young people for the Party and always serve as a political school guiding the ideological progress of young people.  The League should always be a vanguard force in mobilizing China's youth in continuous endeavor, he added.  Xi told the League to always serve as the strongest "bridge" and "bond" that connect the Party and Chinese youth, as well as to conduct self-reform.  League members must play exemplary roles in life and work, earnestly attend political training, and strive for the glorious goal of becoming qualified CPC members, Xi said, urging them to build up firm beliefs, and boost their courage and skills to carry out struggles.  They should also be patriotic and innovative, while not being misguided or intimidated by difficulties, he added.  Noting that the CPC is always worthy of trust and to be followed by young people, Xi said the Party always opens its door to young people and warmly welcomes them to become the new blood of the CPC.

Xi noted his close contact with Macron over the past five years, which has helped guide the two countries in sustaining the positive momentum of bilateral ties, conducting fruitful cooperation, and fulfilling the responsibilities of major countries on climate change, biodiversity conservation and other issues.  In a world undergoing changes unseen in a century, China and France, two permanent members on the United Nations Security Council and independent major countries, should uphold "independence, mutual understanding, strategic vision and win-win cooperation," a commitment the two sides made when establishing diplomatic relations, stick to their close and enduring comprehensive strategic partnership, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and strengthen coordination and cooperation in the bilateral, China-Europe and global contexts, he said.  Xi added that China will keep close exchanges with France at all levels to promote the healthy growth of China-France relations and maintain world peace and stability.  Xi stressed the need to identify, through bilateral dialogue mechanisms, cooperation priorities in the coming five years. He called on the two sides to step up cooperation in emerging areas including artificial intelligence and clean energy, while advancing cooperation in traditional areas like civilian nuclear energy, and aerospace.  The Chinese president said China is ready to import more quality products from France, welcomes French financial and hi-tech companies to China for business cooperation, and hopes that the French side will provide a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises that conduct investment and cooperation in France.  Xi said that it is important that China and France make good use of big occasions like the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic relations and the Paris Olympics, both to take place in 2024, as important opportunities to further increase people-to-people and cultural exchanges and enhance mutual understanding.  He added that the two sides should follow true multilateralism, uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law, support multi-polarity and economic globalization, and deepen cooperation on climate change and biodiversity.  Xi stressed that the two sides need to increase communication and coordination at the Group of 20 and on global food and energy security, expand trilateral cooperation in Africa and other regions, and explore cooperation on the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative.  The Chinese president pointed out that the steady and sound growth of China-EU relations serves the interests of people in China, in Europe and in all other countries, adding that China appreciates France's commitment to strategic autonomy, and hopes that France will encourage the EU to keep a right perception of China and work with China in the same direction by managing differences properly and building on converging interests for closer cooperation in economy and trade, green and digital development, and people-to-people exchanges.  Xi also expressed his hope for France, who holds the rotating presidency of the EU, to play a positive role in promoting the sound development of China-EU relations.  For his part, Macron commended the open spirit with which the two sides have developed their relations since establishing diplomatic ties.  Over the past five years, the two sides have carried out fruitful cooperation across the board, Macron said.  For the next five years, France will work with China to deepen cooperation in areas including agriculture, aviation, civilian nuclear energy and culture and to scale up cooperation in climate change and biodiversity, with a view to greater achievements in France-China relations, said the French president.  France is willing to play a positive role in the development of EU-China relations, he added.  The two leaders also exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine and agreed that relevant parties should support Russia and Ukraine in restoring peace through negotiations.  Xi stressed that China has been working in its own way to promote peace talks, and that China supports European countries in keeping the security of Europe in their own hands.  He urged vigilance against bloc confrontation, which poses a bigger and more persistent threat to global security and stability.  Macron noted the many common understandings between France and China on the issue of Ukraine, adding that France stands ready for closer coordination and cooperation with China at both bilateral and multilateral levels.  France and the EU are committed to strategic autonomy and will not endorse or take part in bloc confrontation, he said. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

During the meeting, Xi also expressed his hope that Germany will play a positive role in developing a steady and sound China-EU relationship.  On various occasions, Xi has elaborated on the importance of strengthening China-Germany relations as well as China-EU ties. The following are some highlights of Xi's remarks in this regard.  May 9, 2022  In the virtual meeting with Scholz, Xi said both China and Germany are major countries with important influence.  Under the current circumstances, it is particularly important for the two countries to maintain sound and steady growth of bilateral ties and better harness the stabilizing, constructive and steering role of this relationship, Xi said.  This not only serves the interests of the Chinese and German peoples but will also contribute significantly to world peace and tranquility, Xi added.  Xi underscored that China and the EU are comprehensive strategic partners and each other's opportunity, and that the two sides have far more common interests than differences.  It is important that the two sides, with a dialectical and long-term view, with mutual respect and with the right perception, increase communication and enhance mutual trust, Xi said.  March 8, 2022  During a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and Scholz, Xi noted that China and the EU share much common understanding on promoting peace, seeking development and advancing cooperation.  Xi said it is important for the two sides to enhance dialogue, stay committed to cooperation, and promote steady and sustained progress of China-EU relations.  China's development will create broader space for China-EU cooperation, Xi said, adding that the two sides must, under the principle of mutual benefit and win-win, further deepen green and digital partnerships as well as practical cooperation in various fields.  Dec. 21, 2021  In a phone conversation with Scholz, Xi said China attaches great importance to its relations with Germany, noting that the two countries should chart the general course of bilateral relations from a strategic perspective.  Over the past half century, China-Germany relations have demonstrated ample vitality, endurance, resilience and potential, Xi said, adding that for the next 50 years, the two countries should embrace a global vision from a long-term perspective, forge ahead and strive for new development of China-Germany relations.  Dec. 8, 2021  In a congratulatory message to Scholz on his election as German chancellor, Xi said he is willing to work with Scholz to promote the bilateral ties to a new level.  China and Germany are all-round strategic partners, Xi noted, adding that over the years, they have been adhering to mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and pursuing win-win cooperation, which has yielded results benefiting the two countries, their people and the world.  Facing the major changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, China and Germany have strengthened communication and cooperation, jointly supported the global fight against COVID-19 and promoted economic recovery, demonstrating their sense of responsibility as major countries, Xi said.  Oct. 13, 2021  During a virtual meeting with then German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Xi and Merkel reviewed the development of China-German and China-EU relations in recent years.  Noting that 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, Xi said that keeping bilateral ties on the right course is of crucial importance.  "China always views its relationship with Germany from a strategic and long-term perspective, and is ready to maintain high-level exchanges with the German side, promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples, tap the potential for cooperation in traditional fields, while exploring new areas of pragmatic cooperation in energy transition and the green and digital economy, among other areas, to further advance bilateral ties," Xi said.

Four years ago, Wu and his wife along with their parents, and their three children left their hometown, a remote mountain village in Fenghuang County. As part of the local poverty alleviation program, they relocated to a three-story building in the resettlement area in the center of Heku Township.  In 2018, the local government built 756 new buildings in Heku Township for poor households looking to relocate. A total of 4,784 people from 932 poverty-stricken Miao ethnic households were gradually relocated to Heku from four surrounding townships.  The Heku resettlement area is the largest centralized resettlement area for Miao ethnic group in Hunan Province.  Not long after moving in, Wu's family fell in love with their new residence.  The newly constructed building features yellow walls, grey tiles, and arching eaves, showcasing the popular architectural style of the Miao ethnic group. Schools, hospitals, farmers' markets, and even a basketball court all help make life more convenient for the new communities.  Adapting to the new lifestyle, however, is a significant challenge for people from remote mountainous villages. Local government officials had to teach to them how to use new equipment, such as door locks, windows, gas stoves, taps, and toilets.  Of course, some people still hold a strong attachment to their hometown. They return to the villages where they used to live and work, and visit their relatives, said Shi Chengbang, Party chief of Mituo Village.  Art groups, including ethnic dance and folk music groups, have been organized to preserve the culture of local ethnic minorities. Relocated villagers can also earn some money via the performances presented by these groups.  The government has established clothing and luggage manufacturing industries in the resettlement area to create jobs for the relocated villagers in order to sustainably increase their income. Meanwhile, jobs for public services, such as cleaners and guards, are also available in their new communities.  After the resettlement, villagers have found they have more business opportunities, and some relocated households have started to run small shops or stalls.  Since 2015, the Chinese government has implemented poverty alleviation relocation programs to address the needs of nearly 10 million poor people and help lift them out of poverty. By the end of 2020, a total of 35,000 resettlement areas were built across the country and more than 9.6 million people bid farewell to old villages and embarked on a journey to establish a new life.

Recently, some overseas media outlets have hyped disinformation suggesting China has suspended issuing passports to citizens, or prevented people from leaving the country.  Such disinformation is intended to undermine the country's legal, targeted and effective entry-exit management measures introduced under the backdrop of maintaining regular COVID-19 response approaches, said an NIA spokesperson.  The administration has firmly implemented a strategy to prevent both inbound cases and domestic resurgences since the COVID-19 outbreak, effectively reducing the risk of infection caused by individuals entering or exiting the country, the spokesperson said.  Immigration agencies at all levels across the country have improved entry and exit measures to offer timely passport services for people who need to go overseas for study, business, research, medical treatment or other purposes, according to the NIA.  Authorities have also expedited passport services for people heading overseas to help with the anti-COVID fight or transfer relief supplies.  The spokesperson, however, warned that the global pandemic is far from over and there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning how it will develop. With the risk of being infected still high, the NIA advised people to refrain from non-urgent and unnecessary cross-border travel.  People who need to enter or exit the country can access information from the official NIA website, WeChat account or hotline, the spokesperson noted. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The State Council detailed supportive policies in a document, including subsidies to employers that hire more graduates and guaranteed loans for young entrepreneurs.  Key groups including college graduates are under pressure to secure jobs as there will be a record number of new graduates from universities and colleges this year.  The government vowed to create more jobs in manufacturing upgrades, emerging industries, and services.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises that employ more graduates will get social insurance subsidies, guaranteed loans, interest discounts, and tax and fee reductions. The platform economy will be encouraged to play a more significant role in creating jobs. The state-owned enterprises will also recruit more.  College graduates starting their own businesses will enjoy favorable policies, including one-off subsidies and tax breaks, and government-invested incubators will allocate 30 percent of facilities to them for free.  Those meeting economic hardship can also have their repayment of student loans deferred and interest reduced or exempted, according to the document. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Li Zhen gives a class to students. (Changjiang Daily/Peng Nian)  Li graduated from the School of Music at Central China Normal University in Wuhan, capital city of central China’s Hubei Province in 2010. He won several gold prizes when participating in national dance competitions during his university days. After graduating from the university, he rejected decent offers from employers such as the Hubei Song and Dance Troupe and instead became a teacher at the Wuhan No. 2 School for the Deaf in the provincial capital.  However, Li was very frustrated in the beginning because he was unfamiliar with sign language and was unable to communicate efficiently with his students.    Li Zhen gives instruction to students. (Changjiang Daily/Peng Nian)  To solve the problem, Li began to bury himself in learning sign language and had managed to get a good command of sign language in only two months.  Li teaches his students how to feel the rhythm of the music by putting his hands in the air to clap the rhythm and make gestures.  Over the past years, Li led the school’s art troupe to win 11 national awards. More than 70 of his students were enrolled in their ideal universities thanks to their exceptional skills and his guidance. In 2018, Li’s students defeated other teams comprised of children with no disabilities and took the crown at an international cheerleading open held in Italy.    Li Zhen gives instruction to students. (Changjiang Daily/Peng Nian)  On March 4, 2022, Li used sign language to conduct 50 individuals with hearing impairment, who staged a Winter Paralympic Waltz together with 40 individuals without disabilities at the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games at the Bird’s Nest.  Liu Xin, the headmaster of the school, said that Li has had many opportunities to seek a better career these years, but he has nonetheless chosen to continue on in his role as a teacher at the school.

This may sound like a secluded scene in the wild, but this tranquil environment is actually in an urban area.  Qiu Yu had never thought about camping in the park near Fenhe River, about 10 km north of downtown Taiyuan City, the capital of north China's Shanxi Province.  "Couple of years ago, there was nothing but the river and wild trees, and almost no one would like to come," said the 36-year-old camping-lover.  The change occurred in October 2021 when the ecological restoration project of the 43-km-long Taiyuan section of the Fenhe River was completed, providing a leisure space for citizens to get close to nature.  The Loess Plateau in Shanxi is the largest loess area in the world. In the past, the area was known for its ecological fragility and soil erosion. As a heavy industry base, Taiyuan suffered from heavy air and water pollution.  Since the beginning of this century, a drive for green and sustainable development has swept China, and ecological restoration projects have been carried out in the Fenhe River valley and many other places on the Loess Plateau.  This green transformation has not only given residents more choices for leisure and entertainment but has also been the bread and butter for many.  Lyu Fuqin planted over 1.3 hectares of scholar trees and apricot trees in the past month.  "I used to cut trees to cook and make fire, but now I plant them," said the 52-year-old living in Linxian County, Lyuliang City. He is now a forester, and bid farewell to his former life as an ordinary farmer who struggled to make ends meet.  As a former poverty-stricken area, 91 percent of the land area in Lyuliang City is hilly and mountainous. In the past few years, the city has combined afforestation and poverty alleviation, which has not only significantly improved the environment but also helped a group of poor households increase their incomes.  "As a forest planter, I now earn more than 40,000 yuan (about 5,944 U.S. dollars) yearly," Lyu said, adding that he had built a two-story house, and funded a wedding for his youngest son.  Over the past few years, nearly 100,000 people have participated in the afforestation projects in Lyuliang, including 65,000 former poor households, and their annual per capita income has increased by about 5,000 yuan, the official data showed.  Moreover, the project has elevated the forest coverage rate in the city to 28.6 percent by the end of 2021.  The stereotype of the Loess Plateau as an arid and lifeless place is quietly changing. According to official statistics, the average precipitation in Lyuliang has increased by 81.8 mm annually from 2016 to 2020, and the amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River has reduced by more than 7 million tonnes.  By constructing terraced fields on hillsides to develop agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s, Dazhai Village in Xiyang County was famous worldwide. About 10 million domestic and international visitors have visited the area.  However, the villagers have stopped building terraced fields, and started to return farmland to forests and developing ecotourism.  The former agricultural pace-setter, which once built more than 53 hectares of terraced fields, has returned about 20 hectares of arable land to forests at present.  "I prefer working here rather than in big cities," said 31-year-old native Li Zhenjiang, who used to work in Beijing. He finally settled in the village by running two souvenir shops, earning more than 100,000 yuan a year.  Through the development of ecotourism, the collective income of Dazhai reached 23 million yuan in 2020, and the annual per capita income has reached 26,000 yuan.  "Why should I go out to make a living, when I can make money on my doorstep? As the environment gets better, the village will become more prosperous in the future," said Li.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"We have seen fewer hazy days and black and smelly water bodies, and have enjoyed bluer skies and more lucid waters and lush mountains," Han Wenxiu, a senior official with the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, said at a press conference.  China's afforested land has accounted for about a quarter of the world's total, and its CO2 emissions per unit of GDP have dropped about 34 percent, Han said.  The country has also topped the globe in installed capacity of wind and photovoltaic power and other green energy, and in the production and sales of new energy vehicles, Han said.  As a faithful advocate of the Paris Agreement, China has announced targets of peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060, Han said.  CONCRETE EFFORTS  Ecological protection has been high on the policy agenda of the world's second-largest economy over the past decade as solid actions have been taken to advance ecological development and push the country toward a green future.  Accountability has been ensured as lists of responsibilities have been drawn up by central and local authorities and environmental inspections have been launched and deepened, Ye Min, vice minister of ecology and environment, said at the press conference.  China has enacted or revised 13 laws and 17 administrative regulations covering the prevention and control of air, water and soil pollution, accompanied by meticulous efforts to guarantee the laws are strictly enforced.  The national carbon market has started trading and the national green development fund has been set up. At the end of 2021, outstanding green credit amounted to 15.9 trillion yuan (about 2.36 trillion U.S. dollars).  To encourage the green shift of businesses, China has incorporated more than 3.3 million fixed pollution sources into sewage management and has issued catalogs on products that pose high environmental risks or are crucial to environmental protection.  China has also vigorously improved public awareness of environmental protection and promoted green lifestyles.  To build a beautiful China, Ye said continued efforts have to be made in cutting carbon emissions, fighting pollution and improving environmental governance. He also stressed the importance of local accountability, business participation, public oversight and market-oriented mechanisms.  LOW-CARBON TRANSITION  As China's ecological advance has entered a critical period focusing on carbon reduction, enormous progress has been made in its transformation to green and low-carbon development.  Speaking at the press conference, Hu Zucai, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, listed a series of major achievements from the widespread use of clean power to more efficient energy consumption.  The installed capacity of renewable energy in China has exceeded 1 billion kilowatts, with that of hydropower, wind power, solar power and biomass power all ranking first in the world. The share of clean energy has risen from 14.5 percent to 25.5 percent in the country's energy consumption mix.  Ultra-low emission coal-fired power generation has exceeded 1 billion kilowatts, leading the world in efficiency and emission reduction.  Progress has also been noticeable in energy conservation. China's average annual economic growth of 6.5 percent over the past years was powered by a mere 3 percent annual increase in energy consumption. The energy consumption intensity has dropped 26.2 percent, which is equivalent to saving 1.4 billion tonnes of standard coal or an emission cut of 2.94 billion tonnes of CO2.  Looking forward, Hu stressed that China's carbon reduction push is a profound, systemic reform that cannot be achieved easily or swiftly. "The phasing out of traditional energy must be based on the safe and reliable replacement by new energy sources."  China will step up efforts to develop new energy, Hu said, adding that 450 million kilowatts of hydropower, wind power and solar power generation capacity will be built in deserts, with the first projects totaling 85 million kilowatts having broken ground.  The task of peaking CO2 emissions and achieving carbon neutrality will be advanced in an orderly, forceful and effective manner, and new progress will be made continuously, he said.

However, in the same evening, at 9:20 p.m., the local police station received an emergency call reporting that an elderly person in the compound was suffering from a sudden heart attack and was in urgent need of medical treatment. Two police officers on duty then set off for the compound on short notice.  When they arrived, the patient had already passed out and her husband was desperate for help. In light of the situation, the police called up the hospital to arrange for an emergency room and decided to transfer the patient there in their police car.  The siren sounded and the lights flashed as the police car raced at full speeds on a life-saving mission. An emergency route was made clear for the car, with it only taking 7 minutes for the patient to get to the hospital.  In retrospect, 5 more minutes would likely have made the difference between life and death, said the doctor who successfully completed an emergency surgery for the patient. In the end, one life has been saved and a family has therefore been shielded from tragedy.

In October 2021, China authorized Tianjin University to grant the country's first interdisciplinary master's degree in intangible cultural heritage studies. It marked the relevant talent cultivation entering a new stage and China's intangible cultural heritage preservation undertaking shifting from mere "rescuing" to more scientific approaches.  As an interdisciplinary major, studies on intangible cultural heritage involve humanities, social science, and natural science. The new discipline aims to educate talents able to undertake intangible cultural heritage investigation and identification, inheritance and protection, publicity, transformation, and utilization.  The first edition of the textbooks will be published in three volumes, covering its general theory, studies on folk literature and art, and oral history of the cultural heritage inheritors. The textbooks will likely be compiled within this year.  "The textbooks will establish a complete knowledge system. It would be a rigorous and clear theoretical system for these studies to find a unique educational way and help cultivate research and management talents for intangible cultural heritage education," said Feng Jicai, chief editor of the textbook series and also a renowned Chinese writer.

The 12 districts include all the urban and major suburban districts, namely, Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai, Shijingshan, Fangshan, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Changping, Daxing and Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Xu Hejian, a spokesperson for the Beijing municipal government, told a press briefing on Thursday.  Xu called on locals to reduce personnel flows to cut off the transmission chain of the virus, assuring that the city's routine operation and the supply of daily necessities will not be affected.  Beijing reported 36 new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections between 3 p.m. Wednesday and 3 p.m. Thursday, Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the Beijing municipal disease prevention and control center, told reporters.  Thirty-two cases were detected among people under closed-off management and four were found in mass screening in communities, Pang said, adding that among the new infections, 32 are moderate or mild cases and four are asymptomatic carriers.

The country has planned to temporarily defer the premium payments of old-age insurance, unemployment insurance, and workplace injury insurance for the hard-hit catering, retail, tourism, civil aviation, highway, waterway and railway transportation industries, according to a statement jointly released by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State Taxation Administration (STA).  Individual businesses and workers in flexible employment that have difficulties in paying basic old-age insurance premiums in 2022 are allowed to defer the payments until the end of 2023, Zheng Wenmin, an official with the STA told a press conference Thursday.  The policies are expected to pump up over 80 billion yuan (about 11.89 billion U.S. dollars) of cash flows for firms and individuals, and play an underpinning role in relieving cash strains for smaller firms and stabilizing employment, Zheng said.

The migratory birds began to travel north in late February. However, some wild cranes of the species were still at the lake in May, a relatively rare sight in previous years, said the Jiangxi Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve Administration at a video conference on Thursday.  Researchers will keep an eye on the lingering cranes, said Luo Hao from the administration's scientific research department.  Poyang Lake has an intact ecosystem and is an important wintering spot for waterfowl in Asia. The peak migration period for birds heading to the lake begins in mid-December and continues into early January.  Rated as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, the Siberian white crane, also known as the snow crane, has a global population of around 4,000.  The other end of the migration route, Russia's Kytalyk National Park, has signed a memorandum of understanding on strategic cooperation with Jiangxi Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve Administration to jointly protect the wild birds.  "The white cranes will visit Kytalyk National Park in batches all the way from China's Poyang Lake," said Sargylana Mikhailova with the Kytalyk National Park. "We will pass on the baton of protecting the wildlife, study their breeding conditions and share our research results with China." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The HKSAR government appealed to eligible persons for receiving the third dose of COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible to enhance protection and to prepare for the implementation of stage three Vaccine Pass at the end of this month.  Patrick Nip, secretary for the civil service of the HKSAR government, said that at present, there are about 1 million people who are due to receive their third dose but have not yet done so.  "We need the proactive response from every member of the public in boosting the vaccination rate together and building a stronger protective barrier to cope with the future risks brought about by potential emergence of new mutant strains," Nip said.  Currently, the COVID-19 vaccination rates of persons aged three or above for the first and second doses are 91.5 percent and 85.6 percent respectively, he said.  On Thursday, Hong Kong registered 115 new COVID-19 cases by nucleic acid tests, and 179 additional cases through self-reported antigen rapid tests, official data showed.

Photo: Xinhua  Amid claims circulating that Beijing would be locked down, which led to local residents flooding supermarkets to hoard food, Beijing officials on Thursday clarified that these are just rumors, but local residents are suggested to stay at home and take nucleic acid testing in the following three days as a bid to curb transmission in communities as early as possible.  Beijing reported 36 COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours, among whom 32 were discovered in areas under management and four outside those areas, Pang Xinghuo, an official from the Beijing health authority, said at a press conference.  Cases found in communities are still the biggest risk to and the main target of the zero-COVID strategy in Beijing, Xu Hejian, the spokesperson of the Beijing government, said at the press conference.  In order to curb virus transmission in communities outside managed areas, Beijing will launch another three rounds of nucleic acid testing from Friday to Sunday in 12 districts, including Chaoyang, Haidian and Fangshan, Xu said.  Residents in the these districts are suggested to work from home on Friday and stay home over the weekend, avoiding movement, according to Xu.  Xu refuted rumors circulating on social media platforms, which claimed that officials would announce a citywide lockdown in Beijing. He noted that it is unnecessary to hoard food.  Beijing has adequate supplies of goods and commodities to ensure people's daily lives during the epidemic, and take-away and delivery services would not be stopped, Xu said, calling for residents to stay calm and consume rationally.  Meanwhile, many Beijing residents had dashed to hoard food amid the rumors. When the press conference started at 5 pm, photos circulating online showed that some people stopped shopping and carefully watched the press conference on their hand phones at supermarkets, waiting to find out whether the capital would be locked down.  Beijing, as the capital of China, carries the hope for large Chinese cities to explore a more effective way to fight against Omicron rather than to lock down or launch static management whenever infections are found. The city is receiving some applause.  An expert from the disease prevention and control system spoke highly of Beijing's decisive move to launch mass and frequent nucleic acid testing at an early stage. He told the Global Times on condition of anonymity that nucleic acid testing is the most effective way to find infections as soon as possible.  Beijing had applied precise management in different districts in according to local epidemic situations to reduce the impact of epidemic management measures on people's lives to the lowest level, the expert noted.  The Beijing municipal government also communicated with and released information to the public very promptly, which has helped reduce public fear. These are all experiences that could be followed by other cities in the future, the expert said.  The overall number of COVID-19 cases in Beijing is at a low level, but we must know the low level came from the great efforts Beijing residents made to actively control the pandemic, a Beijing-based respiratory expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Thursday.  Without these efforts, a large number of infections would emerge rather than individual cases, said the expert, emphasizing the necessity of COVID-19 prevention measures for the public to realize.

(Xinhua/Chen Jianli)  BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- In the face of mounting uncertainties due to COVID-19, one thing remains certain -- China will stick to its dynamic zero-COVID policy that has proven pragmatic and effective.  That steadfast commitment, reaffirmed by the Communist Party of China leadership at a high-level meeting last week, came as the COVID-hit city of Shanghai has seen infections fall over the past 10-plus days and many manufacturers, including Tesla, gradually resume operations.  Shanghai's response is a continuation of China's dynamic anti-COVID measures, which the world's most populous country has constantly fine-tuned and optimized according to the fluid reality.  Beijing's attempts to juggle the COVID response and the economic and social development, which the Chinese leaders have stressed since the pandemic began, have proven efficacious.  The country of a 1.4 billion population always upholds the philosophy that protecting health and wealth during a pandemic is by no means a zero-sum game.  All anti-epidemic measures naturally come at a price, and there has been short-term downward pressure on the Chinese economy. However, claiming that this will stifle the expansion of the world's second-largest economy is as shortsighted as it is irresponsible.  Over the longer term, China will benefit economically from the dynamic zero-COVID approach. It has, so far, prevented many deaths at home and seen the country's industries come through the pandemic largely unscathed.  Mass quarantine, large-scale testing, and closed-off management all take a toll on the economy. But once the outbreak is under control, the economy is expected to maintain its resilience and extend its track record of growth with policy support.  That has been demonstrated as Chinese cities once plagued by the pandemic, such as Shenzhen, still registered stable growth in the first quarter after waves of flare-ups died down thanks to China's zero-COVID strategy. In a report on Shenzhen this week, South China Morning Post focused on the factories in the Chinese technology hub running at near or full capacity while adhering to China's dynamic zero-COVID policy. The report said: "it has so far helped the government walk a fine line."  By only sealing off cities or areas that have seen spikes in infections, launching swift screening and massive inoculation encouragement, and pledging ramped-up efforts to stabilize the economy, China has managed the economic side effects of its COVID-fighting measures and made its zero-COVID policy sustainable.  China's war against COVID-19 is by no means an ideological campaign that "sacrifices its economic growth," as some Western media portrayed it. It's essentially a war to protect people's lives -- the foundation for all economic development.  China's scientifically-based and precise reaction to the virus and an array of pro-growth policies explain why the Chinese economy is off to a steady start this year, with its GDP up 4.8 percent year on year in the first three months.  The taming of the virus, a universal challenge facing the world, necessitates customized and responsive solutions that guarantee the best outcomes. The one that China has been adhering to is such a solution that suits itself. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The study published on Thursday in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine revealed that nearly 1,200 participants in China infected with the coronavirus that caused COVID-19 tend to have poorer health and quality of life than the general population.  The researchers from China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College and Tsinghua University School of Medicine evaluated the health of 1,192 participants with acute COVID-19 treated at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan between January 7 and May 29, 2020, at six months, 12 months, and two years.  The group, with a median age of 57 at discharge, is assessed for a six-minute walking test, laboratory tests, and questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life, if they had returned to work, and healthcare use after discharge.  The study showed that six months after initially falling ill, 68 percent of them reported at least one long COVID symptom, and by two years after infection, 55 percent of them reported symptoms, among them such as fatigue, muscle weakness and sleep difficulties.  Also, their complaints included joint pain, palpitations, dizziness, headaches and anxiety or depression, according to the study.  "Our findings indicate that for a certain proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors, while they may have cleared the initial infection, more than two years is needed to recover fully from COVID-19," said the paper's corresponding author Cao Bing with China-Japan Friendship Hospital.  The authors admitted the limitations including the fact that those who did not participate in the study might have fewer symptoms than those who did, which may result in an overestimate of the prevalence of long COVID symptoms.  But there is a "clear need to provide continued support to a significant proportion of people who have had COVID-19," said Cao.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Wang Xi)  CHENGDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Like many other migrant workers on construction sites, He Chuan mixes concrete and lays bricks throughout the day. Unlike most, however, he has taken the trouble to document elements of his daily life through live-streaming. Adopting the online name "Brother Chuan", he has gained considerable online celebrity.  Hailing from Dazhou in southwest China's Sichuan Province, He, 52, has spent many years as a migrant worker on building sites around China. He is not alone in this, with 25 million Sichuan farmers leaving the fields for city jobs across the country.  Now back in his hometown, He continues to intersperse his construction work with vlogging, setting up his camera to live-stream his lunch breaks before an audience of hundreds, sometimes thousands. His wife Tang Wenshu partners up with him during the sessions, which mostly revolve around the food they are eating and comments on construction work.  In one typical session, "Brother Chuan" can be seen serving his wife a bowl of rice and then wolfing down the rest from the rice cooker. Finally, he displays a piece of crispy griddled chicken, making many of his viewers drool.  POPULAR VLOGGER  Without any professional camera or technical training, the couple have recorded their simple daily life since 2018, drawing nearly 2 million followers on social media platforms with over 1,000 vlogs.  "Although I'm neither handsome nor knowledgeable, I am optimistic and love working," said He, who has worked in construction for around 30 years.  The couple's "studios" are always situated in buildings under construction. With bricks as chairs and storage boxes as tables, the two sweaty faces are always seen laughing and gobbling yummy food in front of the camera.    He Chuan and his wife Tang Wenshu wave goodbye to their audiences at the end of an online show held at a building under construction in Dazhou, southwest China's Sichuan Province, April 29, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Xi)  He said he is happy that viewers appreciate his attitude to life and how construction work has paid off.  "Being recognized and learning new things from comments have driven me to share more," He said.  INFLUENTIAL VOICE  "I was nervous about live-streaming on camera initially," he said. However, his followers, the majority of whom are migrant workers and students, give him great support.  From the online comments and private messages delivered to his mailboxes, He has found that viewers are mostly inspired by his devotion to work, as well as caring about his quality of life.  His hard work received wider recognition in 2021 when he was given a vlogging award by Xigua Video, a video sharing platform. In his acceptance speech for "The Best Moment" award, he said, "If you once drew strength from my company, I hope you can hang in there for a little bit longer, and eventually overcome frustration and difficulties."    He Chuan (R) uses a camera to record his colleagues working at a construction site in Dazhou, southwest China's Sichuan Province, April 29, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Xi)  Live-streams of "Brother Chuan" also create a platform where migrant workers can discuss topics that they care about, such as wage calculation, safety measures and retirement.  "It is safer for aged workers to stop working at heights and leave construction sites, but their livelihoods should be taken into consideration," He said when chatting with his wife during a vlog discussing the welfare of aged migrant workers.  Empowered by digital tools, migrant workers like He are making their voices heard and their lives more visible to wider audiences.    He Chuan plasters a wall and his wife Tang Wenshu mixes mortar at a construction site in Dazhou, southwest China's Sichuan Province, April 29, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Xi)  A LIVING WAGE  Plastering brings the couple 600 yuan (about 89 U.S. dollars) per day, while He's new craft, vlogging, yields him 200 yuan per piece on average, contributing more to their household income than construction work.  He started as a plastering apprentice decades back. Along with the rapid development of China's coastal regions, He and Tang joined the migration stream to seek a fortune in east China's Fujian Province in 2003.  The couple dwelled in a 10-square-meter temporary shed and worked on scaffolds high above the ground for years, joining the construction of soaring skyscrapers and modern venues.  As urbanization in western China has accelerated, the couple returned to their hometown of Dazhou in 2019 and are currently working on a construction site for a digital-economy industrial park.  The couple have bought their riverside three-bedroom apartment in Dazhou and live with their two children. The elder son He Songlin edits videos and manages accounts for his father, while the younger son is studying in middle school.  In a vlog recorded at their apartment, He handed his younger son a slice of cake and said, "Happy birthday, and I hope you go to the university of your choice." Tang also presented gifts to the boy.  This modest family scene moved many viewers, who posted comments expressing their appreciation.

(Xinhua/Wang Xi)  BETTER LIVELIHOODS  According to China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of migrant workers in the country reached 292.51 million in 2021, and their average monthly income has risen to 4,432 yuan, exceeding the national average of 2,927 yuan.  Last week, the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council jointly issued a document stating that migrant workers will receive better support at the county level with regard to various public services, including housing, professional training, children's education, pensions and medical care.  Among the countless fancy buildings that He has worked on, he likes building schools the most. Recently, he participated in the construction of a local vocational college. Seeing young people playing basketball on the playground he built, He said he was more than satisfied.  His account profile on one short-video platform sums up the vlogger's constructive attitude: "I work hard to earn money to support my family, and contribute to the construction of our country."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"We have seen fewer hazy days and black and smelly water bodies, and have enjoyed bluer skies and more lucid waters and lush mountains," Han Wenxiu, a senior official with the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, said at a press conference.  China's artificial afforestation has accounted for about a quarter of the world's total, and its CO2 emissions per unit of the gross domestic product have dropped about 34 percent, Han said.  The country has also topped the globe in installed capacity of wind and photovoltaic power and other green energy, and in the production and sales of new energy vehicles, Han said.  As a faithful advocate of the Paris Agreement, China has announced targets of peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060, Han said.

La Hong, a building manager in a community of Shanghai told CGTN her daily tasks for the new role include distributing self-test kits, organizing nucleic acid PCR testing for residents, and distributing supplies to each of them. They also coordinate with the neighborhood committee on chat groups whenever residents have any issues.  The freshness faded away quickly, she said, adding that getting things done are not easy. Sometimes things get complicated, when some residents are reluctant to cooperate. And sometimes, things "pile up."  "I cried. At that time, I was just starting out as head of the building. Then all kinds of things went wrong. The neighborhood committee also felt that I wouldn't be able to do things, and all kinds of negative things accumulated and broke down," she recalled.  But La persisted in her work and in recording her life. Her three episodes of “Serving as a Building Manager” have racked up some 15 million views on the Chinese video-streaming platform, Bilibili.  The 22-year-old was one of the site's top unloaders in 2019, where she already has 2.8 million followers.  "I've been shooting videos for five to six years, and they're just based on my daily life. It's part of my routine. I like documenting my life. This time, I had the opportunity to meet all kinds of people. I also learned about how to communicate with people," she said.  "Everyone has different thoughts. I need to learn more about respect, open-mindedness, and the concept of coexistence," she added.  Based on what she's learned so far, she said she's hoping to do more as a building manager.  "I feel that we've reached a bottleneck period. We've all been at home for a certain period of time, so I'm trying to find ways to engage in some entertaining activities. Otherwise it will be really difficult," La noted.  With more trust from her neighbors and more praise from her viewers, La said she's learned that there are more gains from stepping up to help out. Source: CGTN ]]></full-text></doc>

Thanks to a public-service project named "Ever Shining Cinema," the film about Ne Zha, a devil born into a loving family and eventually emerging as a hero, can find its way into a special-education school in Lhasa, the capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, on Tuesday.  The school is home to around 250 students, including 51 with visual impairments.  "I was filled with excitement. I love the movie," said visually impaired student Lhamo Drolkar. "The project and its barrier-free films enable us to enjoy the silver screen, just like the sighted moviegoers."  The "Ever Shining Cinema" project was initiated at the end of 2017 by the Communication University of China, Beijing Gehua CATV Network Co., Ltd., and Oriental Jiaying Media Co., Ltd. It aims to interpret movies for visually impaired people through dubbing to meet their spiritual and cultural needs.  China has about 17.3 million people with visual disabilities, according to the second national sample survey on disability.  By the end of last year, the project had produced 416 barrier-free movies and one barrier-free TV series and held 254 public welfare screenings nationwide.  In 2019, the "Ever Shining Cinema" project brought a barrier-free movie to Tibet for the first time.  "In the future, we will strengthen ties with the visually impaired in Tibet and send more and better barrier-free movies there. We hope the barrier-free concept can take root in the snowy plateau region," said Zhao Shuping, a professor at the Communication University of China and the project instructor.  The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled came into force in China on May 5.  The treaty aims to eliminate copyright-related obstacles for print-disabled people in obtaining works. Experts believe it will create a broader space for the production and dissemination of barrier-free films and television dramas in China.  "The vivid characters in the movies make me believe that through my efforts, I can create a bright life too," said Lhamo Drolkar. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The bureau released a report on the city's ecological environment situation in 2021 on Wednesday. According to the report, the city's average concentration of hazardous airborne particles PM2.5 last year was 33 micrograms per cubic meter, while the average concentration of PM10 was 55 micrograms per cubic meter.  The PM2.5 reading is a gauge monitoring airborne particles of 2.5 microns or less in diameter, which can penetrate deep into people's lungs.  Data released showed that other key air pollution readings, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, all reached the national standards during the period.  Besides the improving air quality, none of the total 97 sections of Beijing's major water systems were graded Class V in terms of their water quality in 2021. The proportion of surface water at or above Grade III in the country's five-tier water quality system reached 75.2 percent, up 11.4 percentage points compared to the prior year.  Meanwhile, about 116 kinds of phytoplankton, 195 kinds of zooplankton, 207 kinds of benthonic animals and 41 fish species were monitored in Beijing's main streams and tributaries, key lakes and large- and medium-sized reservoirs.  Notably, the city's carbon dioxide emission per 10,000 yuan (about 1,486 U.S. dollars) of GDP last year fell by about 4 percent compared with 2020, said the report.

The HKSAR government launched the third stage of outreach vaccination service on April 15 and set the target of providing outreach vaccination service to unvaccinated RCH residents who have recovered from COVID-19, and those who are due to receive the next vaccine dose after their first or second dose by Tuesday.  With efforts of various parties, the overall first-dose vaccination rate at RCHs based on the total number of RCH residents has risen from 55 percent in mid-March to 84 percent as of Tuesday, while the overall vaccination rates for the second and third doses at RCHs are 56 percent and 14 percent respectively.  Patrick Nip, secretary for the civil service of the HKSAR government, said that under the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly and RCH residents are the most vulnerable groups and are most in need of the protection conferred by the vaccines, urging the public to understand the risk of death faced by the elderly after being infected with COVID-19 and the efficacy of vaccines.  A total of 16 outreach teams have been set up by the HKSAR government to provide health assessments and vaccination to residents of RCHs for the elderly and disabled persons as early as possible, involving a total of over 700 healthcare personnel.  On Wednesday, Hong Kong registered 131 new COVID-19 cases by nucleic acid tests, and 149 additional cases through self-reported antigen rapid tests, official data showed.

From April 3 to May 2, Muslims of various ethnic groups in the region observed Ramadan. They celebrated Eid al-Fitr, which fell on May 3, while enjoying a one-day holiday, said Xu Guixiang, spokesperson for the regional government, during a video conference on Tuesday.  Memet Juma, hatip of the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar Prefecture, said that prayers visited the 550-year-old mosque every day, and thousands of people of different ethnic groups performed their traditional dances on the square in front of the mosque.  Noting that Xinjiang is home to various ethnic groups and religious beliefs, Zumrat Obul, head of the regional united front work department, said that all normal religious activities are protected by law.  In recent years, there has been great misunderstanding about the religious situation in Xinjiang, and the United States in particular has groundlessly claimed that religious freedoms are restricted in Xinjiang.  "These ridiculous lies run completely counter to the facts," Xu said.  "We would like to go on telling Xinjiang's true stories to the international community," Xu said. "We are also looking forward to welcoming more visitors to Xinjiang who can witness the prosperous and comfortable life here." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

A host promotes fishing rods via livestreaming platform at an e-commerce supplies base in Suning county, north China’s Hebei province, June 6, 2020. (People’s Daily Online/Yuan Liwei)  County towns are an important component of China’s urban system. Official data indicated that by the end of 2021, the county towns of 1,472 counties in China had a combined permanent resident population of around 160 million and the urban areas of 394 county-level cities had approximately 90 million permanent residents, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the resident population in China’s urban areas when combined.  Meanwhile, the number of counties and county-level cities made up about 65 percent of the country’s county-level administrative regions.  “Promoting the construction of county towns can help accommodate rural migrants as local residents in cities and towns and improve the spatial layout of urbanization for coordinated development of cities of different sizes and small towns,” said an official with China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).  There are a vast number of county towns in China, each of which has various forms and development paths. The development of many county towns is still confronted with certain constraints. Such problems as unsophisticated industrial platforms, incomplete supporting facilities and ageing public facilities have reduced county towns’ carrying capacity and attractiveness.  According to the guidelines, China will clarify functions of county towns across the country, divide them into five categories according to their characteristics, and determine different development paths for them.    Photo shows workers busy with production at an industrial park for high-end manufacturing in the economic development zone of Dangshan county, Suzhou city, east China’s Anhui province, Dec. 14, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/Cui Meng)  The guidelines stated that efforts will be made to speed up the development of county towns surrounding large cities, actively cultivate county towns featuring professional functions, help county towns in main producing areas of agricultural products enjoy rational development, develop county towns in key ecological function areas in an orderly manner, and guide transformation and development of county towns that are losing population.  The document also set out 25 tasks concerning five aspects of the development of county towns, including cultivating characteristic industries, improving municipal facility system, strengthening the supply of public services, raising the quality of living environment, and promoting the connection and complementarity among functions of county towns, townships, and villages.  Industries serve as the foundation for the construction and development of county towns. China is going to enhance county towns’ capacity to support the development of industries, nurture characteristics, and achieve staggered development, pointed out the guidelines.  The country will focus on developing industries with significant comparative advantages and a large capacity for driving the development of agriculture and rural areas as well as for employment in county towns, and coordinate the cultivation of local industries and receiving industrial relocation, according to the guidelines.  Meanwhile, county towns should also improve the functions of industrial platforms and guide the cluster development of local industries; improve commercial distribution networks, develop logistics centers and specialized markets, and build distribution and transfer centers for industrial and agricultural products; and improve consumption-related infrastructure, enhance vocational skills training, and help migrant workers from rural areas, especially those facing difficulties, elevate their skills, quality, and ability to maintain stable employment, the document stressed.    Photo taken on April 17, 2022 shows picturesque spring scenery of a wetland park along Heihe River in Gaotai county, Zhangye city, northwest China’s Gansu province. (People’s Daily Online/Zheng Yaode)  Efforts will also be made to raise county towns’ carrying capacity and attractiveness, including upgrading municipal facilities, improving public transportation facilities, smoothening channels for better connection and communication with other regions, and advancing digital transformation, according to the document.  The guidelines also demanded deepening institutional innovation to provide a policy guarantee for the construction of county towns. For example, county towns are asked to remove all limits on household registration and establish diversified and sustainable investment and financing mechanisms.  They should formulate reasonable investment and financing plans according to the nature and benefits of projects, noted the document.  Local governments can increase investment in public welfare projects and provide support for eligible projects with the central government budget and their special-purpose bonds, said the document.  The document also encouraged increasing medium and long-term loans and expressed support for the issuance of special corporate bonds by qualified enterprises for new urbanization in county towns.  According to the guidelines, China will achieve important progress in urbanization with a focus on county towns by 2025; and, through a period of efforts after that, it will basically build modern county towns with distinctive characteristics, vitality, livable environment, and sound employment conditions across the country.

(Photo/Ye Xueling)    Photo shows white cranes inside the Nanchang Five Stars Siberian Cranes Sanctuary. (Photo/Zhou Haiyan)  In 2017, Zhou Haiyan, a photography enthusiast, together with other photographers, rented a 200,000-square-meter lotus field in an attempt to use the lotus roots grown there to feed white cranes, which are under first-class state protection in China.  Before taking up this job, Zhou had been a TV hostess. In 2013, she developed a new hobby in the form of photography, and every year since then she would take time to photograph birds at Poyang Lake in Nanchang, east China’s Jiangxi Province. The beautiful white cranes gradually were able to capture her heart.  Growing lotus proved to be an arduous task for Zhou when she started. During the ploughing season, she often got up at 5 a.m. to prepare for the transplanting of lotus seedlings. Slogging through the sticky mud while wearing high-tube rubber boots, she soon found that her legs and feet would get drenched with sweat.  Zhou and her colleagues spent more than 1 million yuan ($148,600) to build the lotus field, which is located near Poyang Lake. They waited several months before the white cranes finally began arriving at the field in November 2017. In the winter during the same year, more than 1,400 white cranes gathered around the lotus field.  For nearly 10 months throughout the year, Zhou will remain at the lotus field, planting lotus seedlings, managing the field, waiting for the arrival of the white cranes and receiving visitors who came to watch the birds.  Bird watchers, photographers and scholars from nearly 40 countries have visited the protection center. Thanks to the joint efforts of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Forestry, the Nanchang Forestry Bureau, and the Nanchang High-tech Industrial Development Zone, the center was listed as a trial site for receiving an eco-compensation fund.  Some people have suggested that Zhou should invite tourists to enter the protection center and charge them admission fees. However, Zhou refused to do so as she was determined to minimize any disturbance to the birds. She even dedicated the money she had been compensated for after the demolition of her home to running the center, despite her family’s opposition.  In November 2018, when white cranes started to show up in the sky above the protection center, a parking lot which had just started construction near the farm scared the birds away. Zhou was sad and worried about this new development. She then reported the situation to the local government and in January 2019 the construction work was suspended.  At the beginning of the same year, six institutes, including the Nanchang Five Stars Siberian Cranes Sanctuary, signed a memorandum of understanding for white crane research and protection.  In August of the same year, Zhou underwent surgery to remove polyps from her stomach. On the fifth day after the surgery, when she was still hospitalized, Zhou got news that officials at the provincial level would inspect preparatory work for the upcoming Poyang Lake International Birdwatching Week. Believing that the event would be an opportunity for the development of the Nanchang Five Stars Siberian Cranes Sanctuary, Zhou immediately discharged herself from the hospital and returned to the sanctuary.  During the Poyang Lake International Birdwatching Week, the sanctuary garnered the attention of increasingly more people, and after some important domestic and international guests visited the protection center, they all spoke highly of it.  In the spring of 2020, the lotus farm was expanded to cover more than 666,666 square meters, and the infrastructure at the protection center was greatly improved. In the winter of the same year, the protection center received more than 2,800 white cranes.  In November 2020, a nature education center and a museum for the popularization of knowledge about white cranes were both established near the Nanchang Five Stars Siberian Cranes Sanctuary.  In 2021, more than 80,000 people visited the white crane protection center, a number that is bound to continue growing in the years ahead. Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Such public interest litigations, which include both civil and administrative actions, shall be filed in specialized maritime courts, according to the document made public Wednesday.  After finding acts detrimental to the marine ecology and resources, a procuratorate may inform the competent authority to bring a lawsuit, the document stated, adding that if the latter fails to do so, the procuratorate may file a civil public interest lawsuit at the maritime court.  When a procuratorate finds that the department responsible has failed to perform its duty to supervise and handle marine-related illegal activities, resulting in an infringement of national interests or public interests, it shall put forward procuratorial suggestions to the department and file an administrative public interest lawsuit in case of the latter's further inaction.  The judicial interpretation also stipulates that procuratorates may initiate incidental civil actions in public interest during criminal proceedings or separate civil public interest lawsuits. ■ Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.  U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL  Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.  Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.  "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."  The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."  Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."  Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.  Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.  "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.  As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.  "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.  "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.  From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.  A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."  This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."  ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE  Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.  With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.  The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.  "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."  The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.  Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.  "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.  Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.  "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.  "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.  VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN  It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.  Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.  "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.  Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."  "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"To influence domestic policies in recipient countries ... the U.S. has provided assistance to serve its goals and achieve its interests," Ayman Okeil, general manager of the Cairo-based Maat for Peace, Development, and Human Rights, told Xinhua in a recent interview.  THE NED AS A PROXY  Among all the proxies Washington uses to serve its political agenda in other countries, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was founded in 1983 as a bipartisan, non-profit institution by the U.S. government, is one of the most active.  Nominally a non-governmental organization that provides support for democracy abroad, the NED in fact relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the U.S. Congress, and takes orders from the U.S. government.  Okeil described the NED as one of Washington's "soldiers" for interfering in other countries' decision-making process.  The NED has worked as a substitute for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cultivating pro-U.S. opposition activists for subverting lawful governments and provoking uprisings in the Arab countries under the pretext of promoting democracy, he said.  According to Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, the NED was founded as a tool for projecting political influence in different sovereign states that the U.S. government has labeled as "non-democratic, totalitarian, authoritarian and anti-American."  The NED supported opposition groups in other countries, which were trained to represent Washington's interest, rather than the vital interests of their own nations and states, Rawashdeh pointed out.  Echoing Rawashdeh's point, Okeil said that the NED has spent millions of U.S. dollars to support political parties, labor unions, dissident movements, and media in dozens of countries.  The organization has been employed as the "mastermind" behind separatist riots, color revolutions, and political crises around the world, with the aim of toppling legitimate governments and creating U.S. puppets in targeted countries, said Ahmad Ashqar, a Syrian journalist and political expert.  The NED makes sure that nations across the globe do what the United States wants them to do and in no way feel confident and capable of pursuing their own political/ideological agendas, Rawashdeh said. "And this is also what the U.S. foreign policy is doing for decades."  A NEW TYPE OF IMPERIALISM  The United States, unfortunately, has created a new type of imperialism, by occupying foreign countries with money and forces and interfering in their choice of leaders and party compositions, Okeil told Xinhua.  Unlike the funds that came from some countries like China, which help improve health, education and development sectors, the U.S. economic aid is always with conditions attached, he noted  Okeil's words are not groundless. According to a study by the American University in Cairo in November 2021, the NED has allocated more than 606 million dollars in "democracy assistance" to Egypt in the period between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the U.S. government provided 415 million dollars in economic assistance to Egypt, which includes 55 million dollars to support programs for promoting democracy.  However, as Tariq Fahmy, a political science professor at the Cairo University, noted, the U.S. mode of democracy has not been successful in the Middle East, and it contradicts many countries' unique conditions.  "We all saw the disgraceful role in provoking the Arab Spring via funding the protesters" under the cover of democracy and human rights, Fahmy said, explaining that such kind of imposed democracy couldn't breed stability.  After the Arab Spring, many people in the Middle East have started to see the real objectives behind the U.S. aid when knowing that Washington had a role in inciting the Arab Spring uprisings via supporting, training and funding young protesters, Okeil noted.  The U.S. model of democracy is not suitable for the world, and based on that model, the U.S. policies led to real crimes, Fahmy said.  It's a fact that the United States has distorted the positive meaning of democracy and emptied such a notion of anything useful and beneficial for other countries, Ashqar argued.  "We have seen several examples like in Syria, where the United States used democracy as a pretext to support separatist forces and radical ones to destabilize the legitimate government," he said. "The U.S. presence in Syria has achieved all but the so-called democracy."  "Under the pretext of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy, the U.S. has stolen key areas in Syria rich with oil and gas, do you call that democracy?" asked the Syrian journalist.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  *The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements.   *The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House is peddling its so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" against China and ramping up its pressure campaign of the Russia-Ukraine conflict during a two-day summit in Washington with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  But its hope to pull ASEAN members into its camp will shrivel, as ASEAN countries have already woken up to Washington's typical hegemony, hypocrisy and egomania.  The arrangement of the summit itself has laid bare Washington's double-dealing nature. Its disrespect for ASEAN members concerning scheduling issues despite its pledge of "enduring commitment" has sparked a wave of complaints among ASEAN members, resulting in a postponement of the summit from late March to May.  Cambodian Minister attached to the Prime Minister Kao Kim Hourn said before the summit that if Washington was serious about improving its ties with ASEAN, it should have arranged bilateral meetings between the United States and ASEAN countries. ASEAN leaders "should be treated with respect and equality," he noted.  The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements. The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  Many sober minds in ASEAN have seen through this duplicity and bullying. Indonesia and Malaysia warned that AUKUS could lead to a major arms race in the region. A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."

(Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)  Meanwhile, the White House will attempt in vain during this summit to talk ASEAN into imposing sanctions against Russia. Ever since the escalation of the current Ukraine crisis, Washington has been trying to exert pressure on ASEAN to take sides, but most of ASEAN members did not follow suit.  On April 7, six of the 10-member bloc abstained from voting in favor of a resolution to remove Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and two voted against it. Long adhering to an independent foreign policy, ASEAN members have urged solving the crisis through negotiation and dialogue.  Moreover, some ASEAN members have been well aware of Washington's unspoken calculations to turn bloody sufferings of others into golden opportunities for profits in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during his visit to China in early April, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said he appreciates China's objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, that "Asian countries should maintain peace and stability in the region, jointly resist unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law, and prevent attempts to create tensions and replicate crises in the region."  Playing small clique politics and forcing others to take sides -- Washington's old tricks to gain geopolitical interests -- work against ASEAN's will to uphold regional peace and stability and to realize sustainable economic development. Launching trade wars and breaking pacts -- Washington's classical acts of unilateralism -- severely disrupt normal trade exchanges and supply chains in the region and deal a heavy blow to ASEAN's economy. All those wrongdoings have tarnished Washington's credit and influence as the world's sole superpower, and driven it further apart from ASEAN members.  The long arc of history teaches each and every country that acting without scruples almost always results in the reverse of what one desires. It is time for Washington to learn this lesson, abandon its old dream of Cold War hegemony, uphold an open and inclusive mindset, and play its due role in maintaining regional and global peace, stability and development.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Large retail companies in Shanghai have started to reopen their supermarkets amid the recent COVID-19 resurgence. (Xinhua/Chen Jianli)  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has exerted downward pressure on the Chinese economy. With an array of pro-growth policies to produce their intended effects, the risk is manageable and the sound fundamentals of the world's second-largest economy in the medium-to-long term will not change.  To cope with the pandemic, China has applied a stringent dynamic zero-COVID policy. As the pandemic is still raging across the world and coronavirus continues to mutate, there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning how the situation will develop. The country has warned against any slackening in its efforts to control the virus.  China's stance has been firm and clear -- unswervingly adhering to the dynamic zero-COVID policy while shoring up the economy and ensuring people's lives are affected as little as possible.  Giving proper consideration to all these aspects is a difficult task. The earnest implementation of this policy is a major test for all regions and departments.  A string of pro-growth policies is in the pipeline. China has already adopted multi-pronged fiscal measures in tax and fee cuts, public budget expenditure and bond issuance to stabilize the economy and ensure its people's wellbeing.  Moreover, China has accelerated the establishment of a unified domestic market, comprehensively strengthened infrastructure construction, and deepened reform and opening-up across the board.  The State Council and relevant departments are also rolling out detailed policies and measures to help industries, individually owned businesses and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises hit hard by the pandemic, and to stabilize market entities.

(Xinhua/Zhang Jiansong)  Chinese authorities have ample space and diversified tools for fiscal, monetary and other policies. They have rich experience in responding to downward pressure on the economy and will further strengthen regulatory control, and will do so when the time is right.  The Chinese economy is off to a steady start this year, with its GDP up 4.8 percent year on year in the first three months. Despite the downward pressure, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, including its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. After pro-growth policies gradually produce their intended effects, China's economic performance will improve.  By contributing approximately 30 percent to world economic growth, the Chinese economy is the largest engine driving global economic growth. The Chinese economy is at a critical moment in overcoming its difficulties. It is only by remaining confident and rising to the challenges that China can turn adverse situations into opportunities, embrace its bright prospects, continue to inject dynamism into the stability and recovery of the global economy and bring broader market opportunities for all countries.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Graphic: Zero-sum or zero-carbon/People's Daily Online)  The Glasgow climate summit held last year was largely viewed as a chance for redemption. After the grim outcome of the (2°C) mitigation target set at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, humanity's "last chance" to save the planet, nations were nudged to give climate cooperation another shot. Few world leaders are more zealous and vocal on the matter than US president Joe Biden, who has proposed a portfolio of ambitious goals and called for joint collaboration between major players and, in particular, the US and China.  Then, last February, in a surprise move, the Biden administration announced that it would extend the Trump-era Section 201 tariffs slapped on solar panels, in a bid to "continue facilitating positive adjustment to competition" from imported photovoltaic cells. Though the administration did offer some clues on the "positive adjustment," almost four years after the tariffs were levied, experts argued that America's solar industry remained nascent in its development despite full-blown trade barriers and that the decision came at an emissions cost.  In an opinion essay published earlier this month in The Hill, John Paul Helveston, an American researcher, debated that tariffs won't help the US build a "robust solar industry." He contended that China's tremendous R&amp;D efforts on photovoltaic (PV) innovations, which helped slash the prices of most PV panels from $2,000 per kilowatt to just $300 per kilowatt, cannot be simply duplicated. It is highly unlikely that another nation will be able to "replicate China's skills in the time frame needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change," he cited an article he co-wrote in Science back in 2019, adding, "Rather than continuing the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese solar panels, the US and others should be partnering with Chinese firms to obtain low-cost technologies and components to increase domestic deployment of renewables as fast as possible to meet the narrow window left to decarbonize."  Low-cost solar technologies and components, however, have been the very items subject to Washington's ongoing investigation.  The New York Times reported on April 29 that, amidst an investigation by the US Commerce Department targeting Chinese-made PV parts, the US solar industry has been "frozen," with over 300 solar projects being "canceled or delayed." American energy enterprises, big and small, have all been dragged into the quagmire of self-censorship over Chinese solar parts. "The investigation is having a catastrophic negative impact on the renewable energy sector and driving up electricity prices. With each day the tariff investigation continues, the country is falling further behind in achieving our climate goals," said Nick Bullinger, COO of a Chicago-based solar company, in an interview that appeared in the Times article.    U.S. President Joe Biden (R) speaks during an event, at the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States, on May 9, 2022. Biden said that the administration is "discussing" whether to drop hiked tariffs on Chinese products. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  From the perspective of environmental benefits or from the standpoint of economic interests, Washington's 4-year-long-and-counting solar clampdown is cost-ineffective, as it collides with even Biden's own climate agenda.  US president Joe Biden attended the Glasgow summit with high hopes—100% renewable energy by 2035; but the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), an NGO, estimated that America's current production capacity only makes up 15% of its demand. Neither will taxing and purging Chinese solar panels or PV parts help "bring jobs back home," since even with heavy tariffs the US remains heavily dependent on imported PV products.  Besides, the volume of jobs generated by solar installations in the US is ten times larger than the manufacturing jobs created by the nation's entire solar sector, according to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). As a letter sent to President Biden last January by eight American senators (from both parties) stated, the Section 201 tariffs had "led to the loss of more than 62,000 American clean energy jobs and 10.5 gigawatts of foregone solar deployment." It is difficult then to tell who the tariffs and investigation are designed to punish: overseas solar producers or the American labor force?    Photo taken on Nov. 19, 2021 shows the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  But it's not hard to detect what formula is being applied in America's zero-carbon solution—its default zero-sum fixation. After all, the one-nation's-gain-representing-another's-loss mindset takes various shapes in the China-US relations from Washington's point of view.  On the global stage, it is reflected in Washington's unreasonable belief that China's global presence, such as donating COVID-19 vaccines to developing nations, will undermine the superpower's global influence.  In the economic sphere, it is manifested in America's obsession with punitive tariffs, which it deems will help reverse trade deficits and boost domestic industry, even though the burden will ultimately be shifted towards American consumers in the form of rising prices.  In the technological and academic realms, it is showcased in America's year-long crackdown on Chinese tech companies and its unjustified witch-hunt targeting Chinese academics and students.  ... ...  The aforementioned aspects of Washington's zero-sum practices are epitomized by its now-stagnant solar industry, which in turn has demonstrated why such a mindset won't work. Internationally, it will risk hindering the joint cause of emissions reduction; economically, it will impede the low-hanging fruits and long-term benefits brought by the should-be full-fledged solar sector; and, from the perspectives of innovation and technological progress, it will further dampen the outlook of cooperation on green innovations.

(Xinhua/Liu Lei)  Dwelling on a planet that is currently plagued by a global pandemic (accompanied by inflation and a possible recession), haunted by continuous wars and conflicts, and overshadowed by the looming threat of global warming, we all know that a zero-sum fixation and a Cold-War mindset won't help fix any of these global problems. On the contrary, they are destined to make the planet warmer, wars deadlier, and other global puzzles more insoluble.  For Washington, it needs to face the reality that it cannot achieve technological hegemony or climate leadership by setting up a new Iron Curtain to deter and isolate China. Returning to a rational and pragmatic China policy is the sole way to nurture healthy and sustainable China-US ties and encourage the two sides to work together on issues of common and global concern. Conversely, the zero-sum mindset is bound for a lose-lose path.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

However, a handful of politicians from a few Western countries launched an unscrupulous smear campaign, taking this opportunity to make malicious attacks on China.  Their obsolete tricks of creating a "trap of public opinion" and grossly interfering in China's internal affairs out of ideological bias again revealed the evil political agenda of some Western forces to make trouble in Hong Kong and contain China.  While issuing groundless and illogical slanders against the democracy in Hong Kong, the politicians ignored the truth that there is no one-size-fits-all democratic model in the world, and a sound democracy fits the reality of a specific region and works to solve its problems.  Over the past few months, three elections in Hong Kong -- the Election Committee election, the election of the Legislative Council, and the election of the chief executive -- have manifested the advantages of the new electoral system of the HKSAR as it ensures broad representation, political inclusiveness, balanced participation, and fair competition. The economic and social development in Hong Kong over the past year also demonstrated the obvious progressiveness and strong vitality of the new system in guaranteeing social stability, developing the economy, and improving people's well-being.  On the other hand, the so-called "electoral democracy" in the United States and some other Western countries is money-tainted votes and political shows by nature, where the interests of political parties and interest groups outweigh the public's long-term welfare.  By avoiding the shortcomings of the Western-style "election games," the new electoral system of Hong Kong has restored the election's role in selecting talented people with integrity and competence. Looking from this perspective, the groundless attacks by Western anti-China forces are, in nature, a shoddy democracy judging a sound one. It is a gross disrespect to the popular will of Hong Kong residents.  While Hong Kong's new electoral system prevents the anti-China agitators from participating in the HKSAR's governance structure, the agendas of the anti-China forces in the West have experienced a massive fiasco. The recent smear campaign exposed their frustration over the failure to install proxies in Hong Kong.  As a result of the implementation of the law on safeguarding national security in the HKSAR and the improvement of its electoral system, Hong Kong has returned to the right track, with the rule of law restored, the business environment improved, and the democratic rights and freedoms enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong in accordance with the law better protected.  This will definitely benefit the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong with significant influence globally. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The devastating 1-million milestone was a once-unimaginable number when the world-changing pandemic broke out more than two years ago and caused America's first known death.  It is a permanent badge of shame on a powerful developed nation to have lost so many lives to the coronavirus, no matter how hard it tries to whitewash its botched response and move on from the public health crisis, which has also reported more than 82 million infections, the highest in the world.  Researchers agree that if American leaders and policymakers had taken seriously early warnings from the international community and public health experts and put science over politics, hundreds of thousands of deaths and many more infections could have been avoided.  The gut-wrenching reality is that a toxic and deadly cocktail of inaction and incompetence resulted in a human rights disaster and led to a "perfect storm" of COVID-19 swirling across the United States, shaking the logistically and morally ill-prepared nation to its core while exposing the full extent of political, economic and social maladies deeply rooted in America.  COVID-19 has hit minority groups much harder in the United States due to their relative lack of access to health care and resources, despite more likely being essential workers required to work on the pandemic frontline.  Consequently, African Americans experienced a downturn in life expectancy of a shocking 2.9 years, compared to 1.2 years for whites, according to a study published by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.  "Racial inequality was baked into the recipe of the creation of the United States of America," Brookings senior fellow Rashawn Ray argued. "When crises like the COVID-19 pandemic occur, inequalities are exacerbated rather than diminished."  The United States irresponsibly allowed infectious cases to spread to other countries and regions, while disseminating conspiracy theories and sowing divisions, severely undermining global efforts to combat COVID-19 at a time when unity and collaboration are more needed than ever.  "With America in the lead, the world was more divided than ever. America's failure to coordinate a response was no mere sideshow," English historian and professor at Columbia University Adam Tooze wrote. "What 2020 showed, in fact, was that America's dysfunctions are the world's problem."  The COVID-19 death rate in the United States is slowing down thanks to a broad rollout of vaccines. However, the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants has mercilessly shaped the curve of daily new deaths like a rollercoaster. Although deaths in the United States continue to fall, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising due to highly contagious Omicron subvariants.  U.S. politicians, however, appear eager to turn the page. The White House declared a "new moment" in the COVID-19 pandemic in March, as restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus were largely lifted, with senior government officials attending high-profile indoor gatherings to demonstrate a return to normalcy, albeit still prematurely.  Top U.S. infectious disease expert and White House chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci reportedly criticized in private the decision to hold the White House Correspondents' Dinner, after which several guests, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, tested positive for COVID-19, warning that it could be a troubling sign that many Americans no longer view COVID-19 as a serious threat.  "We are still in the middle of a pandemic, to be sure -- there's no confusion about that," Fauci said during an interview with American news publication Foreign Policy in early May. "We hope that we don't see a major uptick as we get into the fall, but that remains to be seen. We're going to have to wait and see."  Steven Thrasher, a Scientific American columnist and professor at Northwestern University, tweeted that the United States is "well into an era of willful, collective amnesia" and that "the shame of a million dead is too much to face -- so most won't." American epidemiologist and science communicator Tara Smith echoed the opinion, tweeting that "a million+ deaths and we already want to forget and move on."  The White House asked for roughly 82 billion U.S. dollars for pandemic preparedness in its latest federal budget request. Still, this amount was only about one-tenth of what it sought for military operations in the new fiscal year, much to the chagrin of many. Furthermore, new COVID-19 funding remains stalled in Congress due to partisan gridlock despite repeated administration requests.  Noting some 1 million people have died from COVID in the United States, American writer Robert Jones, Jr. tweeted. "Governments are apathetic. Politicians are indifferent. Our neighbors think they're invulnerable. Families are devastated. Children are orphaned. Stories are gone. Untold wisdom is lost."  A senior administration official has reportedly stated that the White House is preparing for up to 100 million Americans to contract COVID-19 during a wave this fall and winter if Congress does not provide funding for vaccines and tests, referring to the median of a range of models from outside experts, as part of a renewed push to get financial assistance from a divided Capitol Hill.  As the United States moves forward, at least 1 million people and their families and friends will be unable to do so. The blame is placed squarely on the country's failed leadership and policies, which have inscribed an agonizing chapter in its history and the memories of millions of Americans.

Facing complex changes in the international landscape and various challenges to world peace and development, the leaders of the two countries have been guiding bilateral relations from a high level, providing valuable momentum for greater China-Germany and China-EU cooperation.  Today, peace and development are under threat due to rampant hegemonism and exacerbated global divisions. The onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has reignited the flames of war in Europe.  Such an alarming increase in threats to global security and development has led to an urgent call for more stability and certainty in navigating these turbulent times.  In his meeting with Scholz, Xi said that under the current circumstances, it is particularly important for the two countries to maintain sound and steady growth of bilateral ties and better harness the stabilizing, constructive and steering role of this relationship.  This not only serves the interests of the Chinese and German peoples but will also contribute significantly to world peace and tranquility, he said.  There is no change in China's commitment to developing ties with Germany; there is no change in China's sincere wish for closer cooperation with Germany; and there is no change in China's conviction that China and Germany can make greater differences together, Xi emphasized.  These remarks shed light on the value and significance of China-Germany relations, pointing the way to future cooperation and dialogue between the two countries.  Meanwhile, past achievements have laid a solid foundation for the steady development of China-Germany relations. In the past five decades since the two countries established diplomatic ties, the bilateral relationship has shown great vitality, endurance, resilience and potential.  While Germany is China's most important trading partner in Europe, China has been Germany's top trade partner for six consecutive years. The trade volume between them has mushroomed to more than 250 billion U.S. dollars in 2021 from less than 300 million dollars at the very beginning of diplomatic relations.  Nearly 60 percent of German companies in China reported improved business operations last year, and 71 percent plan further investment in the country, according to a report released by the German Chamber of Commerce in China and KPMG.  As for the question of how China and Germany manage to develop together and contribute to each other's success, Xi offered an appropriate answer: It is essentially attributable to a commitment to mutual respect and win-win cooperation, a valuable piece of experience and important principle that should be upheld all along.  There is immense potential remains for the two countries to enrich their relations and deepen their mutually beneficial cooperation regarding climate change, macroeconomic policy, environmental protection, services trade, AI and digitalization.  In addition, China is speeding up its efforts to foster a new development paradigm, which means broader market opportunities for Germany and all other countries.  Xi called on the two sides to stand for true multilateralism, uphold international fairness and justice, defend the UN's central role in international affairs, safeguard basic norms governing international relations, promote an open world economy, and make global development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive.  He also expressed his hope for Germany's active support for and participation in the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, with a view to building a community with a shared future for mankind.  Since Germany is a pivotal country in the EU, the continent's security is closely associated with Germany. Notably, the ongoing Ukraine crisis has pushed European security to a crossroads.  On this issue, China always stands on the side of peace and makes its conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter, working in its own way to promote peace and defuse tensions.  Xi has emphasized during that meeting: "It is important to make every effort to prevent the conflict from intensifying or magnifying to a point of no return."  For that purpose, the European side needs to show historical responsibility and political wisdom, bear in mind the long-term stability of Europe, and promote a solution in a responsible manner, Xi said, stressing that the security of Europe should be kept in the hands of Europeans themselves.  China's appeal for peace and stability has been widely welcomed in Europe and beyond. When reporting on the video meeting, many European media outlets, including Reuters, headlined Xi's call to prevent the Ukraine conflict from intensifying, fully reflecting how the international community supports China's take on this issue.  In an unsettled international situation, sound and steady growth in China-EU relations remains more crucial than ever.  The China-Europe relationship is not targeted at, subjugated to, or controlled by any third party, which is a strategic consensus that both sides must follow in the long run, Xi said.  Therefore, Xi highlighted the importance for China and the EU, with a dialectical and long-term view, with mutual respect and with the right perception, to increase communication and enhance mutual trust.  Deepening China-Germany and China-EU cooperation will serve the interest of both sides and even the whole world. By adhering to mutual respect, openness and inclusiveness; seeking common ground while reserving differences; and cooperating for win-win results, China-Germany and China-EU relations will indeed ride the wave of uncertainty towards a brighter future.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)  BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese leadership has once again underscored what role the youth should play in the nation's rejuvenation drive.  In a speech on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged members of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) to be responsible, have firm convictions and work hard as the 73.7 million-strong organization celebrated its centenary.  The younger generation, according to Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, should do their best to help realize national rejuvenation -- the greatest dream of the Chinese people since the Opium War of 1840.  The destiny of any generation is closely connected with the era they live in. The youth have more opportunities to achieve their dreams when they chime with the cause of the Party and the people.  The pursuit of the Chinese Dream is a relay race. Since completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects in 2021, China has now embarked on a new journey -- building a great modern socialist country in all respects by the mid-21st century.  Standing at a new historical juncture, Chinese youth in the new era should take on their responsibility, and they will be blessed with a spacious and promising platform.  In his speech, Xi urged youth league members to "always stand on the high ground of ideals and convictions."  Ideals and convictions serve as a beacon for life and pursuits. They determine a person's position and direction. Young people need to observe society, reflect on life, and create a future on the strength of wisdom.  Xi said they should aim high at an early age and cultivate the trust in the Party, the confidence in socialism with Chinese characteristics and the belief in Marxism from the bottom of their heart.  The importance of hard work was also highlighted by Xi.  The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no easy task. It will not be achieved by simply "beating drums and gongs." Daunting challenges are inevitable in this new journey.  Chinese youth in the new era must work hard. Xi said the younger generation is the most energetic and enterprising and the least conservative force in society. The cause of the Party and the people could not have developed without the arduous dedication made by generations of young people.  Chinese youth will always be the vanguard force in realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and meeting challenges in a world undergoing changes unseen in a century.

After the end of the Cold War, the U.S. continued to contain and besiege Russia in pursuit of its “global hegemony” and “absolute security.” Fully understanding Ukraine’s importance for Russia’s strategic security, the U.S. has made Ukraine a chess piece in the geopolitical game between itself and Russia.  The U.S.-led NATO alliance has&nbsp;expanded eastward&nbsp;five times, squeezing Russia’s geopolitical space. Meanwhile, it has instigated&nbsp;color revolutions such as&nbsp;the&nbsp;Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, and supported pro-U.S. forces in the country to confront Russia. The U.S. has also made empty promises after&nbsp;admitting&nbsp;Ukraine&nbsp;into the fold&nbsp;to challenge Russia.  According to former U.S. congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Biden can very easily prevent a war between Russia and Ukraine by guaranteeing that Ukraine will not become a member of NATO. But the U.S. has simply rejected that idea.  Hence, the U.S. incitement is indeed the root cause of Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Furthermore, his running mate, Sara Duterte, daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, also won the vice presidential election. Because of their close policy philosophy, Philippine media outlets said the two would form "joined forces" and predicted that the new administration would most likely continue Duterte's relatively pragmatic and balanced style.  US and Western public opinion generally labeled it as "the most important election in the Philippines over the four decades," and believe that the election result will affect the direction of the Philippines on Washington's "Indo-Pacific chessboard." They have tried to interfere and guide the Philippine electoral agenda from the very beginning of the election. For example, they simply and rudely categorize candidates as "pro-US" and "pro-China," underlining that this is a "contest of values," and hyping that all candidates except Marcos Jr. are "in tough stance" on issues of the South China Sea. These "hints" are so stark that they almost lecture Filipino voters how to vote.  Marcos Jr. made it clear that he would not lean to either China or the US, and would only be "pro-Philippines." He has repeatedly expressed his desire to develop relations with China, called for a solution to the South China Sea issue through dialogue and described China as a "friend." These remarks suggesting his reluctance of taking sides have stimulated some forces in the US and the West. As a result, some US and Western media outlets labeled him as the "son of a dictator." After Marcos Jr. secured the win, they warned that "kowtowing to China" would put the Philippines once again "in a weak position."  Frankly speaking, these expressions are quite rude, implying extreme disrespect and even humiliation of Filipinos as well as contempt for the country's sovereignty.  In the eyes of some arrogant people from the US and the West, it seems Filipinos should only care about the "China threat" and US Indo-Pacific Strategy. And if the people of a country don't make the "right choice" as Washington wants, it shows the "fragility" of that nation's democracy.  Calling its allies and partners, Washington is eager to stir up trouble in the South China Sea. But these forces are becoming increasingly "pretentious" in the region. In this year's presidential election, Marcos Jr. was supported by a large number of young Filipinos who care the most about the economy and employment rather than the dogmatic "values" of the US and the West.  Marcos has rich experience in local governance with good record among governors in the Philippines. Some US and Western media portrayed his victory as a "victory for Beijing," pretending not to see Filipinos' desire for national unity and development - such a yearning is strongly supported in Southeast Asia.  It's clear that the US is taking advantage of the Philippines while not giving it the respect it deserves. The US is unwilling to truly spend any money to help the Southeast Asian nation's development, but still constantly interferes in the latter's internal affairs. In fact, Washington has never treated Manila with sincerity. It sometimes has to make the gesture of roping in the Philippines due to its geopolitical value. This makes US policy toward the Philippines erratic, contradictory and hypocritical. Refusing to be a tool for the US to contain China, Duterte eased relations with China after taking office. This has proven to be more in line with the Philippines' national interests. It is also what Filipinos want to see.  It is worth noting that it is a discourse trap that the US and Western media labeled Duterte or Marcos as "pro-China." That word has been twisted by US and Western media into "kowtowing to China." In fact, they want to use the label to hinder and intimidate goodwill and rationality toward China in the Philippines and drive a wedge between the two countries.  China respects the choice of the Philippine people. China-Philippine relations are based on the fact that the two countries share common interests. We hope that both sides will continue to create new opportunities for common development and bring more practical benefits to the people of both countries while enhancing peace and stability in Asia.

(Xinhua/Rouelle Umali)  Against the headwinds of rising global challenges, it is more important than ever for China and the Philippines to consolidate their friendship and cooperation, properly manage their differences, uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and jointly safeguard the hard-won peace and stability in the region.  MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s landslide victory in Monday's Philippine presidential election is expected to ensure the continuity of an independent Philippine foreign policy conducive to the Philippines-China good-neighborly friendship and cooperation.  Last year, the former senator told local media that the Philippines and China are neighbors and consolidating the good-neighborly friendship between the two countries is for the people's benefit. He pledged to strengthen bilateral relations and promote cooperation in economy and trade, education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges.  China and the Philippines enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges. In recent years, the two countries have established a comprehensive strategic cooperative relationship, deepened the synergy between the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and the plan of "Build, Build, Build," and jointly promoted cooperation in major programs, with bilateral trade flourishing.

(Rouelle Umali/Xinhua)  In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, China and the Philippines have stood by each other to keep their citizens safe and healthy.  The two sides' proper handling of the South China Sea issue has laid an important foundation for the China-Philippines friendly cooperation, benefited the two peoples and also effectively safeguarded regional peace and stability.  Against the headwinds of rising global challenges, it is more important than ever for China and the Philippines to consolidate their friendship and cooperation, properly manage their differences, uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and jointly safeguard the hard-won peace and stability in the region.  Looking into the future, there will be greater scope for China and the Philippines to deepen their win-win cooperation in such fields as anti-pandemic, economy and trade, infrastructure, tourism, education and public health.  China, as outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte has said, is a true and reliable friend of the Philippine people. Indeed, building a closer China-Philippines partnership is in the interests of both sides.  Marcos is scheduled to begin his term on June 30. It is a shared hope that China-Philippines relations will become stronger and their cooperation more fruitful.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Multiple parties from the international community have called on the two sides to engage in peace talks, at least apart from the U.S., which has instead been busy providing weapons to Ukraine.  According to the Associated Press, U.S. President Joe Biden on May 3 visited a missile factory in Alabama, where he made a pitch for Congress to approve $33 billion so that the U.S. could continue to rush aid to the Ukrainians.  In fact, the U.S. is clearly the leading instigator of the Ukraine crisis. The eastward expansion of the U.S.-led NATO alliance triggered the current Ukraine crisis, and after the conflict eventually broke out, the U.S. has constantly continued to stir up trouble, added further fuel to the fire, and benefiting from Ukraine’s misfortune. For Washington, Ukraine is nothing but another one of its chess pieces in the game of geopolitics, not to mention a tool for confronting Russia.  All along, what the U.S. has always wanted to do is to maintain its hegemony. In fact, it doesn’t care about the eventual fate of its “chess pieces.”  Related:&nbsp;  True colors of U.S. in Russia-Ukraine conflict: U.S. profits from the crisis; Europe bears the consequences Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Korea should forge closer ties </title><full-text><![CDATA[  BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative Wang Qishan, also Chinese vice president, attends the inauguration ceremony of South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol on Tuesday, at the invitation of the South Korean government.  Back in March following Yoon's election victory, Xi held a telephone conversation with him, during which the Chinese leader pointed out that the two countries are permanent close neighbors that cannot move away, and are also inseparable partners. Those diplomatic moves, particularly as the two countries observe the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year, reflect Beijing's expectation to forge closer and more productive partnership with Seoul.  China-South Korea relations have blossomed over the past three decades, with considerable interaction and exchanges of businesses and people, laying a sound foundation for future cooperation, including in regional and international affairs.  China has become South Korea's largest trading partner, export destination and import source. In 2021, the trade volume between China and South Korea reached 362.35 billion U.S. dollars.  In June 2020, a demonstration zone for China-South Korea cooperation was unveiled in northeast China's Jilin province, where a batch of industrial parks have been planned for bilateral collaboration in medicine, IT, high-end equipment and intelligent manufacturing, among other fields.  This year also marks the China-South Korea Year of Cultural Exchanges. Sharing close East Asian cultural roots, the two sides have seen notable headway in people-to-people exchanges in recent years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the two countries' people-to-people exchanges reached 10 million visits per year. Both sides are also each other's top source of overseas students.  According to Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming, the two governments are planning to take the anniversary of diplomatic ties and the year of cultural exchanges as an opportunity to step up people-to-people exchanges between the two countries and revitalize bilateral communications and cooperation in the fields of press, think-tank, sports and arts.  As a South Korean adage goes: While a house could be bought with a handful of coppers, a good neighbor is worth thousands of pieces of gold. The past achievements in cooperation between the two neighbors have demonstrated that they are partners with converging interests, not adversaries from different camps.  As two important countries in East Asia, China and South Korea shoulder great responsibility to preserve regional peace and stability. And that depends on mutual respect for each other's major security concerns.  In early May, South Korea's National Intelligence Service confirmed the decision to join the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. Also, Seoul's foreign minister nominee Park Jin said recently that South Korea is considering attending a NATO summit in Madrid next month.  These moves do not necessarily mean an actual NATO membership, yet China has made it clear that NATO, a product of the Cold War, has repeatedly violated international law and wantonly waged wars against sovereign countries. Allowing NATO to expand its influence in the Asia-Pacific would only undermine regional security and peace, and provoke confrontation.  In fact, maintaining regional security and stability, which can only be achieved through dialogue and consultation, is in the common interest of both China and South Korea and the whole region. A political settlement to the Korean Peninsula issue, one of South Korea's top security concerns, tallies with China's position.  To that end, China is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with South Korea on Peninsula affairs and provide assistance within its capacity, as Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated on various diplomatic occasions.  Keeping peace and harmony with neighbors is embedded in the Chinese people's long-established values. It is hoped that the new South Korean government can join China in maintaining the hard-earned development momentum in bilateral relations and jointly build a more peaceful and prosperous Asia-Pacific community.

As a product of the Cold War, NATO should have been dissolved when the Cold War ended. However, in order to maintain its global hegemony, the U.S. has stuck to the Cold War mentality, willfully pursued group politics, and continued to use NATO as a strategic tool for controlling Europe and containing Russia.  Europe, caught in the vortex of bloc confrontation, has become one of the main victims of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  The conflict between Russia and Ukraine will exert a serious impact on the European economy. In 2008, the U.S.-originated global financial crisis severely impacted Europe, plunging many European countries, especially countries in Southern Europe, nto austerity due to soaring fiscal deficit and debt.  Fourteen years later, the sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) against Russia and Russia’s counter-sanctions following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have again made a massive impact on the European economy.  Prices have already skyrocketed in many countries in Europe. EU’s policies on decoupling from Russia have increased its reliance on more expensive liquefied natural gas from the U.S., significantly elevated production costs of European companies, and weakened the long-term competitiveness of European industry, which will disrupt Europe’s energy transition and climate policies and once again raise the levels of fiscal deficit and debt in Europe.  The combined impacts of the Ukraine crisis and other structural factors have rendered the long-term economic prognosis for Europe rather bleak. The gaps between Europe and the U.S. in terms of both economic growth rate and size are believed to become wider.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict will escalate Europe’s political and social division. Over the past more than 10 years, Europe has been plagued by increasingly prominent social and political division and polarization besides economic slowdown, which is largely a consequence of unsatisfactory economic conditions and declining living standards.  Europe has lost 10 years to the global financial crisis. Socially and politically, the continent's countries would suffer irreparable harm if the Russia-Ukraine conflict were to drag on for another decade.  Continuation and escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict will pose serious risks to the security of Europe. The U.S. and NATO are currently escalating confrontation with Russia. As they significantly increase military spending, the possibility of a new Iron Curtain in Europe goes straight up.  Many European countries are close neighbors of Russia. Hostility, antagonism, and confrontation between them and Russia can easily spiral up and worsen, which is detrimental to Europe’s security. This can hinder Europe’s development and cause accident and misjudgment that lead to new conflict or even war.  The strategic goal of the U.S. is to maintain its global hegemony. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has severely damaged Europe’s economic and security interests, but served the strategic intentions of the U.S.  If Europe stops getting its energy from Russia, U.S. energy, which was not competitive before, will be able to quickly take over European markets.  Besides, a large portion of the substantial increase in military expenditure in European countries will flow into the U.S. and help improve the capabilities of U.S. military enterprises to develop and produce new equipment and weapons, which eventually increases Europe’s military dependence on the U.S.  With tensions between Europe and Russia mounting, the U.S. can not only use security guarantee as a pretext for further tightening control over Europe, but realize the goal of containing Russia through Europe.  Affected to different degrees by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe have clearly different strategic intentions in responding to the conflict. In the long run, Europe needs to handle its relations with Russia on the basis of its own interests, carry out more active and productive dialogue with Russia and build a new security framework that can truly help realize lasting peace and stability in Europe. Such a new security framework will also enhance Europe’s strategic autonomy to a great extent.  Europe has tried to pursue strategic autonomy for a long time, but the endeavor has been openly or secretly obstructed and opposed by the U.S.  The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not only brought the fact of Europe’s lack of strategic autonomy under the spotlight, but further demonstrated the necessity for it to enhance strategic autonomy.  Facts have shown that hegemonism, power politics, and bloc confrontation pursued by the U.S. will only undermine Europe’s interests, and only a stable UN-centered international system that sticks to multilateralism can serve its interests.  In recent years, many farsighted personages in Europe have become keenly aware that the U.S. is not a reliable ally of Europe. While the extremely selfish “America First” policy advocated by the previous U.S. administration strained the relations between the U.S. and Europe, the current U.S. administration has only changed the wording, rather than the “America First” essence of the country’s foreign policy.  Many of Washington’s actions, including insistence on the restrictive “Buy American” provisions over the past years, the hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and the establishment of the so-called trilateral security partnership with Britain and Australia, have made Europe more alert to the “America First” policy.

However, some forces in the U.S.-led West, though they are in no position to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, have once again thrown mud at the election and China.  By repeating the obsolete cliches about their so-called "democracy," "freedom" and "political pluralism," their real aim is just to smear Hong Kong's electoral system and force the city into their Western system.  There arises a question whether the electoral system in the West is really advanced. And facts have proven that the West's system can by no means be regarded as progressive.  More than 150 years ago, Mark Twain, a famous American writer, wrote the popular classic novel Running for Governor, which vividly depicted the chaos of American elections at that time -- various dazzling episodes like those in the House of Cards.  All kinds of dirty campaign methods popped up, which even can turn the candidates into "perjurer, thief, body-snatcher, delirium tremens, corruptionist, loathsome embracer."  Compared with more than 150 years ago, today's media have evolved and their methods are more advanced. However, there are still frequent election messes in the United States, and partisan struggles and political polarization are increasingly intensifying, which even the American media have exposed from time to time.  In essence, the elections in the United States are a thorough money politics, a game in which the powerful take turns to deal cards, divide the spoils and play with the "revolving door" of power and money, and they have nothing to do with ordinary people. Enough farces in the U.S. elections have been seen over the years.  As a part of China, Hong Kong is perfectly justified to say no to the House-of-Cards game played by Western politicians, and take measures it deems appropriate to avoid the American Running-for-Governor chaos in elections.  Not long before, due to loopholes in the electoral system, some radical separatist forces penetrated into Hong Kong's governance structure, wantonly kidnapped the overall interests of Hong Kong society, and seriously harmed the well-being of Hong Kong's general public, putting national security and Hong Kong's democratic development in peril.  In response, China's central government has taken decisive steps to improve the electoral system of the HKSAR, resolutely enhance the central government's overall governance over the region, and implement the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," making certain that Hong Kong can only be governed by those who love it and the country as a whole.  Generally, practice is the best touchstone for a system. From the Election Committee elections last September and the election of the seventh-term Legislative Council last December to the chief executive election, the series of successful elections has shed light on the advantages and the progressive nature of Hong Kong's new electoral system, which respects the "one country, two systems" principle and is suited to Hong Kong's realities.  Given the socio-economic development of Hong Kong over the past year, the new electoral system, which has shown great vitality, is believed to ensure social stability, economic development and improvement of people's livelihood in the city.  With broad participation, the process of the chief executive election has thoroughly embodied the core values of democracy. Behind Lee's victory with a high number of votes is the support and affirmation from the general public in Hong Kong.  At a time when the new electoral system is taking root and the city's democratic development is under optimization, the United States and its Western allies' smearing and accusations against the election only revealed their malicious intention to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.  As such "democracy countries" as the United States and some of its Western allies are still caught in rampant social messes and chaos, they are in no position to make the irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong.  Hong Kong's democratic path and its electoral system are China's internal affairs, which brook no external interference.  Any attempts to slander Hong Kong's new electoral system, impede Hong Kong's democratic development and prosperity, and contain China's development are doomed to fail.

Pointing toward another potential recession, the GDP fell by an annualized rate of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. Still, U.S. federal authorities want to tighten the economy even more to force down wages for the working class and weaken the effectiveness of what some call the “Great Resignation.”  Inflation and a tight monetary policy are the latest tools in a systemic class war targeting U.S. workers. Since the pandemic produced a massive shift in the economic organization in 2020 and 2021, many workers refused to work except in jobs and professions that provided the best incomes.  As labor activists Sarita Gupta and Erica Smiley write in their recent book, The Future We Need, millions of workers “were able to leverage a tight labor market to simply leave their jobs and not work for anything less than what they deemed fair.”  In addition, more workers found joining or organizing labor unions an excellent choice to strengthen their bargaining position with employers.  Employers and their political allies reacted swiftly. Many corporations drove up prices, and corporate-owned media began to talk about the problem of inflation and budget deficits. They demanded and got a federal monetary policy that would protect their profit margins.  Even before employment rates had reached pre-pandemic levels—which were already showing signs of weakness—U.S. politicians and the Federal Reserve authorities pushed to tighten the money supply with higher interest rates. President Joe Biden backed off promises for new rounds of economic investments—even as the U.S. political system ground to a halt unable to pass new laws to stimulate long-term economic stability.  Promises to forgive hundreds of billions in student loan debt have been kicked down the road. Little action has been taken to push for a higher minimum wage, and new investments in education, infrastructure, and technological research are lacking.    Illustration: Chen Xia/GT  One exception stands out. War. President Biden’s handling of U.S. policy on the Ukraine crisis has seen swift and unanimous action by the political class to provide tens of billions of dollars of new spending for military contracts. U.S. policy has focused on escalating the war by giving Ukraine a seemingly endless supply of weapons. Instead of fulfilling its obligations to call for peace and talks, the U.S. government has promoted a wider conflict.  The U.S. political class—nearly unanimously in both major political parties—has agreed to unified action to boost resources for the military-industrial complex.  This deliberate choice has proven to be beneficial for U.S.-based military contractors. Media reports indicated that Biden administration officials met with representatives of the top 8 military contractors in the U.S. in mid-April to plan its approach to extending the Ukraine conflict. U.S. arms giants, securing promises for $33 billion in new Pentagon arms deals to Ukraine and in loans to European countries to purchase weapons systems.  Top NATO officials seem fixated on extending the alliance to other European countries to foster hostilities with Russia and its allies.&nbsp;  Critics of U.S. policy believe that the goal of this policy, other than funneling more spending into the coffers of the military contractors, aims to destabilize Russia. Even though Russia has not recovered from the “shock therapy” after the collapse of the Cold War, its control over the flow of natural gas and petroleum resources into Europe has given it disproportionate influence over the European economy.  In the 2000s, NATO and the U.S. resisted Russian requests for admittance into NATO and the European economy, fearing a shift in European allegiances to the east.  The longer-term U.S. agenda appears to aim to find whatever means are available to stall or weaken China’s economic growth and global influence. Rather than systematic talks to defuse tensions or develop cooperative, if competitive, forms of engagement, the U.S. political class and its corporate allies seem obsessed with maintaining the U.S. dominance of a unipolar world system.  In the meantime, the people of Ukraine are made to suffer as the U.S. denies real progress at the diplomatic table. Further, the actual investments required to meet the needs of the U.S. people will have to be put off until the next war has ended. The people of both countries have an immediate interest in peace that their rulers have denied them.

John Lee Ka-chiu was elected with 99.16 percent of the votes. This shows that "patriots governing Hong Kong" is deeply bolstered by all sectors in the Hong Kong society, and the democratic development of Hong Kong has turned a new page after the improvement of the electoral system.  Some people in the US and the West are quite reluctant to see this new page. Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on Sunday openly denied the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong, and exploited the rhetoric used by "lecturers of democracy" to smear Hong Kong's new electoral system, attacking the practice as being "another step in the dismantling of the 'one country, two systems' principle." In response to this law-abiding, open and fair election, the US and the Western media outlets have launched a full-scale attack, and some politicians have expressed their "sour grapes mentality" as a conditioned reflex.  Facts have proven that some forces in the US and the West have tried every trick in the book to destabilize Hong Kong. Although it has been nearly 25 years since Hong Kong returned to the motherland, they still miss the page on which the Treaty of Nanking was signed 180 years ago. They are very nostalgic for the chapter in which Hong Kong citizens were not given freedom during 156 years of British colonial rule. What they are reluctant to remember, and what we must underline, is that Hong Kong today is not the land that Britain occupied in the war of aggression when it forcibly sold opium to China. Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, which has entered the era of "patriots governing Hong Kong."  Why fear for comparison between Hong Kong's past and present! Gone are the days when those who were against China attempted rampantly to destabilize Hong Kong in 2019. The Chinese central government made its assessment of the situation and decisively stopped riots, restored order, transitioned from chaos to stability and brought the city back on the right track of development. The improved electoral system of Hong Kong is conductive to selecting officials based on their integrity and ability and their working hard for the people. This is the embodiment of high-quality democracy.  Lee has served Hong Kong for more than 40 years. He is very familiar with Hong Kong. In fighting the violent demonstrations against the extradition bill, he played a key supporting role in restoring order and rebuilding confidence. Lee is thus widely welcomed by the public. His election is a vivid practice of "patriots governing Hong Kong." All walks of life in Hong Kong have full confidence in him leading the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to consolidate the transition from chaos to order and to start good governance.  Behind the many problems that have emerged in Hong Kong in recent years, there is invariably the shadow of some US and Western hostile forces. The more chaotic Hong Kong becomes, the better it is in their interests. A united and progressive Hong Kong has interrupted their minds to mess up Hong Kong. Those black-clad violent protesters, whom some US media called "former activists," are now feeling "desperate." "Patriots governing Hong Kong" will certainly make the US and Western hostile forces as well as their proxy in Hong Kong desperate. Only when they are desperate, there is hope for Hong Kong  Today in Hong Kong, people yearn for stability and unity in their hearts. Throughout the whole process of the Chief Executive Election, the Hong Kong society has demonstrated its unity and enterprising spirit, which is the new glory of the "Lion Rock Spirit" that Hong Kong people have always taken pride in. We believe that Hong Kong will create brilliance in the new journey, and the practice of "one country, two systems" will be stable and far-reaching. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

However, the consequences of the conflict are largely borne by Europe.  While addressing a G7 leaders meeting on March 24, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden said that “NATO is as strong and united as it has ever been.”  This remark undoubtedly tied Europe closer to the war wagon driven by the U.S. in the latter’s attempt to seek hegemony, and forced NATO to follow Washington in imposing sanctions, while paying the price for these actions.  Affected by the massive sanctions targeting Russia, multiple economic indicators of Europe worsened. Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for Economy, earlier pointed out that after the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the soaring prices of bulk commodities pushed inflation to a new high; suspended trade ties aggravated supply chain pressures, and consumer confidence dropped sharply, all indicating that the conflict has had a significant and far-reaching impact on the European economy.  In addition, European countries also face huge pressure from the refugee crisis triggered by the conflict. The UN Refugee Agency announced on April 20 that more than 5 million refugees from Ukraine had crossed borders into neighboring countries, causing an unprecedented refugee crisis.  As the culprit behind the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S., however, is reaping benefits without getting itself involved militarily.  The European stock market fell sharply; the euro drastically weakened against the dollar, and a significant amount of hedge funds flew out of Europe to the U.S. In March, the U.S. received only 12 refugees from Ukraine, with a large number of Ukrainian refugees still waiting at the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition, since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the stock prices of U.S. military firms soared, indicating that U.S. firms are making a great fortune from the conflict.  It is pretty clear who benefits from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and who loses from it. Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Chen Jianli)  BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- While China is still checking new epidemic flare-ups with its dynamic zero-COVID approach, some Western bigots sensed a chance to talk badly about the country's anti-pandemic efforts and heap scorn on the Chinese government's epidemic control policies.  For example, in its latest rant against Shanghai's anti-epidemic fight, The New York Times (NYT) has gone to great lengths to depict an inept Chinese government and question the "legitimacy" of the Communist Party of China (CPC) "in a time of crisis."  But all those jabs have crumbled in the face of facts. As China has struck a fine balance between pandemic control and economic development, its way of taming the virus has proven to be scientific and effective, and has testified to the country's institutional strength.  For more than two years, China has been putting people's lives and well-being first and sticking to its dynamic zero-COVID approach. In the meantime, it has been making dynamic conditions-based adjustments to its targeted epidemic control measures. All these efforts, coupled with an epidemic prevention focus to guard against both inbound cases and domestic resurgence, have enabled the country to restrict the spread of the virus and minimize the epidemic's impact.  As the highly contagious and latent Omicron variant is sweeping the world, multiple Chinese regions have been overshadowed by the current COVID-19 resurgence. But China has been rising to the challenge.  Through a resolute and full implementation of the dynamic zero-COVID approach, and with the whole-hearted support of the Chinese people, Shenzhen in southern China resumed normal work and production in late March as the resurgence subsides, while community transmission has been cut in Jilin Province since mid-April. Racing against time, Beijing has carried out multiple rounds of nucleic acid testing, and has grasped the basic picture of hidden transmission in society.  Besides, data shows the epidemic situation is steadily improving and under effective control in the city of Shanghai. Daily new COVID-19 cases have fallen from a peak of 27,000 to under 5,000, and nearly two-thirds of the infections have recovered in the city. Over 70 percent of Shanghai's 1,800-plus major enterprises have resumed work and production, and the resumption rate of the first batch of more than 660 key industrial enterprises in the city has exceeded 90 percent.  China's capability of successfully arranging massive nucleic acid tests, building makeshift hospitals, dispatching medical staff and delivering much-needed supplies have all demonstrated the country's systemic ability to pool strength behind significant undertakings and the solidarity of the Chinese people.  Under the guidance of the Chinese central government, Shanghai has mobilized nucleic acid testing teams with a daily handling capacity of 2.38 million test tubes. More than 30,000 medics from 22 provincial-level regions nationwide have rushed to the city to aid in the anti-epidemic battle. To many experts, such prompt actions in Shanghai are a miniature of China's unprecedented mobilization and organization abilities made possible out of the strong and wise leadership of the CPC, which has firmly stood as the most reliable backbone of the Chinese nation and people.  According to preliminary statistics in late April, more than 720,000 Party members volunteered to report for duty during the current resurgence in Shanghai. As of April 30, Party members have also helped set up 164 nucleic acid testing sites in the city.  Support from the people makes a difference in the anti-epidemic response, noted a meeting convened on Thursday by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, stressing the need to make sure that the Chinese people are well-informed, and to timely respond to their concerns.  This people-oriented philosophy, warmly welcomed and highly appreciated by the Chinese people, has secured China in achieving major strategic progress. Among major economies, China has been the first to bring the pandemic largely under control, the first to resume work and production, and the first to achieve economic growth. Even though thousands of daily cases have been reported recently, China, the world's most populous country, is still one of the countries with the lowest infection rates worldwide.  "The comprehensive strategy, marked by rapid mass testing, vaccinations and government support in terms of care for the afflicted, stands in stark contrast to what has happened in other jurisdictions around the world," noted Kenya-based international relations scholar Cavince Adhere. "On the basis of the experience, China is now taking right steps for its densely populated cities and around," said Muzaherul Huq, former Southeast Asia Region adviser at the World Health Organization.  The Chinese people's growing confidence in the government's epidemic control policies, as well as the international community's broad recognition of China's anti-pandemic achievements, have slapped the NYT and its like in the face. In the time ahead, more practice will prove that China's epidemic control strategy is the right choice that can stand the test of history. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Cyber defense has been part of the military alliance's core task of collective defense. By cooperating with South Korea's spy agency, the US-led NATO is attempting to turn the Northeast Asian country into a chess piece to contain China and Russia in the realm of cyber defense. It has extended its cyber defense to the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and even the Indo-Pacific region, paving the way for the interference of Western forces in regional geopolitical affairs.  Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that South Korea joining NATO's cyber defense cooperation offers room for the country to join other US-led intelligence mechanisms. Last year, the National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2022 from the US House of Representatives already required the US administration to consider expanding the Five Eyes alliance to include South Korea and three others if enacted.  "If the US is to contain China or Russia and wins in actual military conflict, it must gain an upper hand in intelligence-gathering. The rearrangement of the US-led cyber and intelligence groups aims to create a global network," said Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and commentator.  South Korea under the incoming administration of Yoon Suk-yeol is believed to enhance ties with the US. The country will welcome US President Joe Biden later this month, his first trip to Asia since coming into office. South Korea is also considering attending the NATO summit slated for late June. Yoon has said he will "positively review" South Korea's joining of Quad if invited.  Seoul is betting its own security on the US-led groupings. However, Song noted that if Seoul deepens cooperation with NATO or even joins NATO, it would only make itself more insecure.  "South Korea's security can only be ensured when it builds mutual trust with neighboring countries, rather than becoming the political and military henchman of NATO," said Song.  It is also worth noting that what serves US interests does not necessarily serve its allies. Although the US wants to expand its military outreach globally, it is not easy for NATO to expand to the Indo-Pacific region.  "Most NATO member states are EU countries who have already been badly battered by the crisis on their own soil. They do not want to be dragged into any crisis in Asia, nor do they want to overdraft the limited resources. NATO expansion to Asia fits the interests of only a few NATO members, such as the UK," said Song, adding that the US may want to achieve the globalization of NATO, but face the realistic problem of catering to all.  NATO is a defensive organization in rhetoric only, while its actions can amount to the definition of an "aggressor." The US knows clearly what consequences Ukraine would face by inciting it to join NATO, but it still led Ukraine to embark on a path of no return.  While Ukraine's joining NATO could provoke Russia's sense of insecurity, what South Korea does might trigger more confrontation with its neighbors, including China, Russia and North Korea, which may cause turbulence in the region, warned Song.  NATO is trying to expand to China's periphery. By trying to create an Asian version of NATO, the US will seriously undermine economic cooperation and prosperity in Asia, and bring about new divisions to the regional geopolitical and geo-economic landscape. Washington's intention to turn an Asia-Pacific country into a frontier of geopolitical confrontation is not in the interests of regional countries including South Korea.

Its 70-plus years of history and practice have proved that the UN, as the most universal, representative and authoritative inter-governmental international organization, is the best place to practice multilateralism and an effective platform for the international community to respond collectively to various threats and challenges.  In troubled times, it becomes even more vital to maintain the global system with the UN at its core.  Everybody knows that many hands make light work. Multilateralism in modern international relations originated from mankind's search for solutions to common problems.  Since the end of WWII, with the vigorous development of the UN and other international organizations, multilateralism has gradually become the consensus of the international community to uphold peace, promote development and meet common challenges through multilateral cooperation.  This consensus has led to accelerated economic globalization, increased international trade, and a stronger interconnection and interdependence between nations.  The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, as regional hotspot issues keep cropping up, traditional and non-traditional security threats are intertwined, and transformative changes and the COVID-19 pandemic have posed severe challenges to the security and development of all countries.  However, the United States still persists in pursuing unilateralism and hegemonism, engaging in power politics, harming other countries' security and development through unfair means, and provoking a new Cold War and geopolitical competitions. Its misbehavior has seriously undermined the international order and global strategic stability.  In the face of complex and grim situations, the international community needs to practice true multilateralism and reject small cliques and bloc politics, strengthen solidarity and cooperation and oppose confrontation and pressure, as well as uphold equality and mutual trust and oppose hegemony and bullying.  Only by moving in the right direction can the international community join forces to build a more prosperous, stable, fair and just world. Just as a famous Chinese saying goes: "Pool the wisdom of everyone and there is nothing you cannot achieve. Gather the strength of everyone and there is no victory you cannot win."  Over the years, China has always held high the banner of multilateralism.  On the international stage, Chinese leaders have made a strong call to uphold multilateralism, pointing out that the way out of the complex problems facing the world is "to uphold multilateralism and build a community with a shared future for mankind."  China has been firmly upholding the international system with the UN at its core, the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the UN's authority and status, and its central role in international affairs.  Facts have proved that China has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order.  From the Belt and Road Initiative to the Global Development Initiative and then to the Global Security Initiative, China has provided one international public good after another, promoted world connectivity, boosted global cooperation and development, and injected more confidence into world peace and stability.  History has shown time and again that when the UN's central role is taken seriously, the world will become peaceful. If individual countries are left to go their own way and start something else, the foundation of the "multilateral skyscraper" of the UN will be eroded.  At a time when the international system with the UN at its core is facing severe challenges, all countries should keep in mind the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, bear in mind the larger interest of the international community, resolve differences through diplomacy and dialogue, and jointly promote global peace and development under the coordination of the UN.

He also warned the lawmakers that the US is facing "a crisis deterrence dynamic right now that we have only seen a few times in our nation's history."  Sensationalizing China's "nuclear threat" to justify actual US nuclear expansion has become a familiar trick of Washington. Last month, Richard told lawmakers at a closed-door hearing that China's "breathtaking expansion" of its strategic and nuclear arsenal is a quickly escalating risk for the US. In March, he said he is "very concerned" about potential "cooperative aggression" from China and Russia. If the efforts are to expand the budget for the department he's in charge, Richard made it - according to the Biden administration's recently submitted fiscal year 2023 defense budget, total spending on nuclear weapons and systems research and procurement grew to $34.4 billion from $27.7 billion for fiscal year 2022.  Of course, this is part of Washington's series ways to justify its arbitrary "nuclear freedom" and "nuclear hegemony" by pretending to worry that "deterrence is no longer sufficient." That is why politicians and media in Washington either hype disinformation like "China is building missile silos in its northwest part," or promote ridiculous fantasies, such as "China might use nuclear weapons in the Taiwan Straits," based completely on hypothetical assumptions. In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it was the US and Western media and politicians who hyped the risk of nuclear war and wanted to "bind" China to Russia, even though China had nothing to do with the war.  These public opinion campaigns were "complemented" by a substantial step-by-step erosion of nuclear weapons limitations from the US. The Biden administration on one hand continues the nuclear weapons modernization efforts it inherited from the Trump administration. It increases investment to accelerate upgrading nuclear weapons and their delivery system, and maintain a low threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. On the other, the Biden administration has not corrected its predecessor's behavior of withdrawing from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which has undermined the international arms control system. The US has also further extended its nuclear forces beyond its territory. Under the leadership of Washington, NATO has expanded the scope of its "nuclear sharing" arrangements and actively promoted the forward deployment of nuclear weapons. And there have been voices in countries like Japan calling for "nuclear sharing" with the US.  Everyone knows that the US is already the "nuclear giant" on earth. According to the estimation of foreign think tank on arms control, the number of nuclear warheads in the US and NATO member countries is about 20 times that of China's. The amount of China's nuclear weaponry and that of the US and its NATO allies is not on the same level. The US sits on the world's largest nuclear arsenal, splashes huge sums of money to modernize its nuclear weapons and constantly relaxes the restrictions of using nuclear weapons. The risk of strategic misjudgment caused by all those will be incalculable.  China's nuclear policy is open and transparent. Of all five nuclear weapon states in the world, China is the only one that pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons. China has made it clear it will not engage in any nuclear arms race with any other country and will keep its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security.  This means that the development of China's nuclear force has its own established pace and China will not dance to the tune of US hype. In contrast, Washington has deliberately upheld strategic ambiguity on the use of nuclear weapons, trying to leave room for self-interpretation for the use of nuclear weapons in the future. People seem to see that Washington is pointing at other people's noses with one hand, while its other hand is quietly unscrewing the bottle and letting the devil out.  A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. At the beginning of this year, leaders of five nuclear weapon countries, China, Russia, the US, the UK and France, issued the Joint Statement on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, which stressed it again. It also expressed the common willingness to avoid military confrontation and prevent arms race. Washington should honor its commitment, rather than make petty moves of an arms race while shouting "deterrence crisis." On the nuclear issue, the "absolute advantage" and "absolute security" it pursues doesn't exist at all. Its strange logic will make all countries, including the US, feel unsafe. Washington should not be stubborn and should wake up in time. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

However, the American political elite is showing little interest in confronting the issue more than two years into the pandemic.  Referred to as "pandemic orphans," these children are at increased risk of alcohol and substance abuse, dropping out of school, descending into poverty and committing suicide, according to studies.  Inflicting a secondary pain on these pandemic orphans is the lack of attention to their immense suffering and the lack of urgency by government officials at all levels to do something about it.  For a government that boasts of defending human rights, turning a blind eye to vulnerable children in its own country throws its credibility into doubt.  A memorandum issued in early April by U.S. President Joe Biden only vaguely promised to lend federal support to pandemic orphans, who appear to be included as "individuals and families experiencing a loss due to COVID-19."  Throughout the memorandum, which vows support for individuals and families suffering long-term effects of COVID-19, a clear and purposeful federal-level strategy to address COVID-19 orphanhood is nowhere to be found.  Reading through the lines of the presidential memorandum, one may also easily and regretfully discover that the White House has failed to present a plan to address the psychological challenges faced by the pandemic orphans. It is undeniable that psychological intervention is among the most vital kinds of help that orphans now need.  "Deprived of parental care, (orphans) can endure physical, psychological, emotional and social harm, with consequences that last a lifetime. These children are also more likely to experience violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation," read a July 2021 statement by Henrietta Fore, then the executive director of UNICEF.  "To prevent and respond to this crisis for children in the immediate and long-term, it is vital that governments provide families with the emotional, practical and financial support they need," Fore said.  It may already be too late. Mary Wall, a senior policy adviser on the White House's COVID-19 Response Team who will serve as the "bereavement lead," told the Atlantic magazine that the program would not have a dedicated team.  Wall said additional funding might be needed at a certain point for the program to fulfill its aim. But in reality, Congress is so divided on approving additional COVID-related spending packages that lawmakers cannot even reach consensus on providing funding to ensure a continued supply of treatments, tests and vaccines -- all basic resources needed in the fight against COVID-19.  A presidential strategy to combat the HIV epidemic, in which a big chunk of congressional appropriation is pledged for kids orphaned by AIDS, has been in place since 2003. But missing with COVID-19 orphans is a sense of responsibility and the will to help those hardest hit by the pandemic.  "If we wanted to focus on children at home, we could absolutely do that," said Rachel Kidman, a social epidemiologist at Stony Brook University. "The expertise is there if the will is there."  With another pandemic resurgence now pending, Congress has been preoccupied with funneling weapons and funds into Ukraine to help the country in the fighting that is half a globe away from the United States.  The situation is dire, and government inaction will needlessly prolong the immeasurable suffering of innocent children.  Unlike COVID cases that may rise and fall, orphanhood cannot come and go. Once orphaned, any sense of normalcy is likely gone forever.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Li He)  Perhaps that is because of U.S. media's die-hard habit of smearing China in every possible way.  BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Once again, The New York Times (NYT) betrayed its ignorance of China.  In a recent report on the COVID-19 fight in Shanghai, the American newspaper jumped to a conclusion that the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is being tested, because residents in Shanghai are volunteering to help each other out during "lockdown" in recent weeks. Such an argument is as ridiculous as it is malicious.  In a stunningly far-fetched manner, the article tried to equate natural and warm-hearted mutual assistance with some kind of expression of discontent towards the CPC. Apparently, its authors were hardly touched by the love and care expressed by ordinary Chinese towards one another in their hours of difficulties. Perhaps that is because of U.S. media's die-hard habit of smearing China in every possible way.  Indeed, Shanghai has been experiencing its most severe COVID-19 wave in the past two years. Its residents' life and work have been impacted by strict measures to contain the highly contagious Omicron variant. And at the early stage of the outbreak, some people encountered various kinds of inconveniences to get food supply and medical treatments.    Du Shun (R), deputy manager of a Hema Fresh store in Wuhan, helps Liu Zengyu, a delivery man from Jiangxi Province, start his electric bicycle to deliver goods in Shanghai, east China, April 15, 2022. (Xinhua/Chen Jianli)  After all, meeting the daily needs of more than 25 million residents in China's biggest city in highly restricted conditions with no precedent to follow has posed a strenuous challenge. That is why the local authorities have on many occasions acknowledged their problems, and vowed repeatedly to improve their services.  And instead of hurting the CPC's legitimacy, the fact that hundreds of thousands of local citizens volunteer to lend each other help and support testifies to the strength of the Party.  In fact, many of the volunteers are either organized by the local authorities or working closely with neighborhood committees. And among those tens of thousands of volunteers the NYT mentioned, a large portion of them are CPC members.  "Wherever there is a need, there must be a Party member," the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee said in a recent open letter to CPC members in Shanghai. "Our Party members must go deep into the community and the masses, stand by and work with cadres and the people in the front line."    A volunteer waits for COVID-19 close contacts to board a transfer bus in Lianqin Village of Beicai Town, east China's Shanghai, April 28, 2022.(Xinhua/Jin Liwang)  Official statistics show that more than 700,000 Party members in Shanghai have registered to join the city's anti-COVID fight, and a large number of CPC members have been working as volunteers in districts, towns and villages. In some communities, 90 percent of community volunteers are Party members.  Anyone with some basic knowledge of the CPC's history would know that mobilizing the public to work with the Party in joint efforts to tide through hard times is both a tradition and a strength of the CPC, as the CPC has pledged that "everything is for the people and everything relies on the people."  Today, there are more than 95 million Party members from all walks of life across China. They are both members of the big Chinese family and representatives of their fellow countrymen. According to a report by Harvard University, the Chinese people's overall satisfaction toward the central government has been above 90 percent for years. Any attempt to sow discord between the Chinese people and the CPC would be futile. The NYT's attack on China's dynamic zero-COVID policy would be no different.  At the moment, the dynamic zero-COVID approach to containing the virus remains the most optimal choice for China.  "If we are not firm about the dynamic zero-COVID policy, China may miss the best time to stem the resurgence of cases, which may lead to higher costs and unbearable consequences," said China's leading epidemiologist Liang Wannian.  As China's economic center and an important link of the global supply chains, Shanghai can only minimize the impact of the pandemic on China and the global economy by putting the resurgence of COVID-19 cases under control and returning to normal as soon as possible. It is the broadest consensus shared by the general public in China.  And from a global perspective, by strictly enforcing the dynamic zero-COVID policy, China is making a huge sacrifice to ensure the long-term economic viability of Shanghai in global trade and commerce, which would inject more certainty into the world economy.

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  What also should be noted is that by citing people's self-reliance as evidence of public frustration, the NYT actually exposed America's monumental failure in battling the pandemic. Over the past more than two years, Washington has largely failed to shoulder its responsibility in leading the anti-COVID-19 fight, and left the American people to fend for themselves.  The NYT should quit its biased coverage on China, and try to understand the country and its ruling party better.  In 1936, when the prospect of the CPC-led social revolution was still unclear, Edgar Snow, an American journalist, ventured to north of China's Shaanxi Province, where the CPC and its military "the Red Army" were based and surrounded by resourceful and powerful enemies. Through comprehensive interviews and objective analysis, Snow made an accurate and foresighted judgment in his report that the social revolution "would eventually win."  In a cave dwelling on the Loess Plateau, Snow asked then 43-year-old Mao Zedong: the enemies' "economic resources many times surpassed ours, and they received material assistance from the outside. Why, then, has the Red Army scored success after success ... and not only survived still today but increased its power?"  "The explanation is that the Red Army and the (CPC-established) Soviet Government had created among all people within their areas a rocklike solidarity, because everyone ... was voluntarily and consciously fighting for his own interests and what he believed to be right," Mao replied.  Eighty-six years later, Snow's professionalism and Mao's words about the CPC's successes can still offer some clues about how the Western mainstream media, including the NYT, can tell their stories of China and the CPC.

Many districts of Beijing on Saturday launched the third round of nucleic acid testing amid efforts to contain the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the city. (Xinhua/Peng Ziyang)  BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- In a country of some 1.4 billion people, any public health issue is of significant concern, and the coronavirus outbreak is no exception.  From combating the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei Province more than two years ago to the ongoing battle against the highly contagious Omicron variant, China has always adhered to a stringent approach to stamping out infections.  China's anti-epidemic experience has demonstrated that its "dynamic zero-COVID" policy is not only the best option but also the bottom line that must be maintained for the country's current epidemic prevention and control work.  Yet, the country's effective anti-pandemic efforts such as temporary lockdowns, brief closures of factories and stores, and suspension of offline classes in schools, have been repeatedly questioned by a number of Western media outlets as being excessively strict.  While it is undeniably true that halting normal production can be costly, it is also true that the virus kills.  Worldwide, the virus has claimed over 6 million lives. In sharp contrast, the death toll was about 5,000 on the Chinese mainland.  By pursuing the dynamic zero-COVID approach, China has managed to safeguard people's lives and well-being and has minimized the epidemic's impact on economic and social development to the largest extent.  With a huge population, China continues to face unbalanced regional development, as well as scarcity and uneven allocation of medical resources. Besides, the vaccination rates for the elderly and children are not high enough.  In China, the number of those aged 60 and above, a group highly susceptible to COVID-19, is around 267 million. It is just unimaginable how many of them might have died had China not undertaken drastic efforts to combat the coronavirus.  The stringent anti-epidemic measures inevitably lead to short-term economic pains, but dynamic zero-COVID is overall a counter-epidemic policy that ensures economic development.  In the first quarter of 2022, China's GDP increased by 4.8 percent year on year. Against the backdrop of global inflation, domestic prices remain steady. The value of goods trade in the period rose 10.7 percent. China's major industrial firms saw their profits up 8.5 percent year on year.  As a result, it is not difficult to conclude that China's dynamic zero-COVID policy complements and bolsters the normal operation of the economy and society. The policy has woven a strong safety net for the 1.4 billion Chinese people. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The falsehoods, confusing right with wrong are an attempt to mislead the world. China's position on the Ukraine issue is above board, objective and fair.  Some examples of the disinformation and the reality are presented below to help the world understand what is really going on.  &nbsp;  Falsehood 1: A U.S. intelligence report said China told Russia that it would not prevent Russia from taking actions in Ukraine,while asking Russia not to do it before the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics. It also said that Russia has asked China for assistance including weapons and other equipment.  Reality Check: Russia is a sovereign country that independently weighs,decides and implements its foreign policy based on its own strategy and interests. There is no need to seek China's consent beforehand. In fact, U.S. officials have admitted that there is no evidence of China providing military assistance to Russia.  &nbsp;  ◆On March 14, 2022, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia had the potential to conduct an operation in Ukraine and had not requested assistance from other countries.  https://ria.ru/20220314/ukraina-1778071724.html  ◆According to media reports, information reported by The New York Times based on an anonymous source was actually provided by a senior official for Indo-Pacific affairs on the White House National Security Council. It was fake news deliberately spread by the U.S. to discredit China, divert public attention and shift the blame.  https://world.huanqiu.com/article/4777H2eyHqM  ◆According to NBC News, U.S. intelligence officers released information about the Russia-Ukraine conflict even when it wasn't "rock solid", and some assertions, such as China considering providing military help to Russia, were made up. This shows the U.S. was taking preemptive action to win the "information war" against Russia.  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-using-declassified-intel-fight-info-war-russia-even-intel-isnt-rock-rcna23014  ◆Speaking to the media on 22 March 2022, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan admitted that he had not seen any evidence of China providing military equipment to Russia.  https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-has-not-seen-china-providing-military-equipment-russia-white-house-2022-03-22/  ◆On March 30, 2022, Pentagon Spokesman John F. Kirby said that the United States sees no indications of Chinese military assistance to Russia.  http://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2983648/pentagon-press-secretary-john-f-kirby-holds-a-press-briefing-march-30-2022/  &nbsp;  Falsehood 2: The joint statement issued by China and Russia on 4 February this year provides evidence of China's support for Russia on the Ukraine issue. The joint statement is a "veiled support" for Russia's "invasion" of Ukraine.  Reality Check: Last February, China issued joint statements with a number of leaders attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The U.S.'s interpretation of the China-Russia joint statement is out of context and part of a smear campaign.  &nbsp;  ◆During the Beijing Winter Olympics, many foreign leaders visited China. China issued joint statements with Kyrgyzstan, Argentina, Ecuador, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and other countries to express mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests and highlight joint efforts to uphold multilateralism.  ◆In their joint statement, China and Russia call on all States to champion humanity's common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, respect the rights of peoples to independently determine the development paths of their countries and the sovereignty and the security and development interests of States, to protect the United Nations-centered international system, and the international law-based international order, seek true multilateralism with the United Nations and its Security Council playing a central and coordinating role, promote more democratic international relations, and ensure peace, stability and sustainable development across the world.  ◆In the joint statement, China and Russia call for the establishment of a new model of major-country relations on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and reaffirm that the new inter-State relations between China and Russia are superior to military and political alliances of the Cold War era, and the strengthening of bilateral strategic cooperation is neither aimed against third countries nor affected by circumstantial changes in third countries or the changing international environment.  ◆The China-Russia relationship features non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting at any third party. It differs from the practice of the US and a small number of other Western countries that stick to Cold War thinking and a friend-or-foe dichotomy to draw ideological lines, form so-called "alliances" and "cliques" and pursue bloc politics to create confrontation and division.  &nbsp;  Falsehood 3: China helps Russia spread disinformation that "the US owns biological weapons in Ukraine".  Reality Check: The US is doing this for the purpose of diverting public attention. According to public information, the US has conducted more bio-military activities than any other country in the world. It is also the only country that has used biological and chemical weapons in multiple wars, and the only country that opposes the establishment of a multilateral verification mechanism for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), a public stand held by the US for more than two decades.  &nbsp;  ◆The US Department of Defense controls 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries. Inheriting the "devil's legacy" from the Unit 731, the notorious branch of the Japanese army during the war of aggression against China,the US conducted research and development of biological weapons at Fort Detrick. Despite the entry into force of the BWC in 1975, the US continued with such activities. For more than 20 years, it is the only country opposing the establishment of a multilateral verification mechanism for the BWC, claiming that "the traditional approach ... is not a workable structure for biological weapons" and "(the draft Protocol to the BWC) would put national security and confidential business information at risk". As a State Party to the BWC, the US is obliged to make clarifications on issues of concerns to the international community in accordance with Article V of the Convention.  http://m.stdaily.com/guoji/xinwen/202203/c679761bfe7c44898178ee7ff0a271f1.shtml  ◆In the working document submitted by the US to the meeting of the State Parties to the BWC in November 2021, the US admitted that it has 26 bio-labs in Ukraine. According to the fact sheet released by the US Department of Defense in March 2022,the US is supporting 46 facilities in Ukraine.  https://meetings.unoda.org/section/bwc-msp-2020-documents/  https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/11/2002954612/-1/-1/0/FACT-SHEET-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE'S-COOPERATIVE-THREAT-REDUCTION-PROGRAM-BIOLOGICAL-THREAT-REDUCTION-PROGRAM-ACTIVITIES-IN-UKRAINE.PDF  ◆The Agreement Between the Department of Defense of the United States of America and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine Concerning Cooperation in the Area of Prevention of Proliferation of Technology, Pathogens and Expertise that could be Used in the Development of Biological Weapons signed by the two countries on 29 August 2005 clearly stipulates that the US Department of Defense representatives shall have the right to participate in all related activities at facilities in Ukraine; all dangerous pathogens in Ukraine shall be stored at designated laboratories; Ukraine shall share with the US data generated by the relevant surveillance network, transfer to the US side requested copies of dangerous pathogen strains, and withhold information designated by the US side as "sensitive" from public disclosure.  https://dontspeaknews.com/2022/02/24/the-secret-us-bioweapons-labs-in-ukraine-and-georgia/  https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/05-829-Ukraine-Weapons.pdf  ◆On March 8, 2022, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland admitted at a Senate hearing that "Ukraine has biological research facilities, which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydSf57SRtcQ  ◆On March 10, 2022, Tucker Carlson, Fox News Channel host, said that the US government is funding secret bio-labs in Ukraine to conduct research on dangerous pathogens. According to him, the US government has repeatedly denied the claim, calling it Russian disinformation, and the American people have been lied to. But the US government official in charge of Ukraine has confirmed that the information about US funding bio-labs in Ukraine is simply true.  https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tucker-the-pentagon-is-lying-about-bio-labs-in-ukraine  ◆On March 18, 2022, Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva released an "investigative material" on US-Ukraine cooperation, revealing a substantial amount of details of biological research cooperation between the two countries. For example, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from public disclosure of sensitive information about the Pentagon's program for bio-labs; the Pentagon has been granted access to certain state secrets of Ukraine in connection with the projects under their agreement; and Ukraine is obliged to transfer to the US Department of Defense dangerous pathogens for biological research.  http://news.cri.cn/2022-03-25/d8399086-f156-53eb-dec6-3a9a5dbf3164.html  ◆William Scott Ritter, a former UN Weapons Inspector in Iraq and former US Marine Corps intelligence officer, said in an interview that "There is an absolute requirement for stringent confidence-building investigations into what the United States was doing (in the US-led bio labs in Ukraine), so that the world can be confident that the United States operates within the framework (of the BWC)".  https://www.news.cn/world/2022-03/31/c_1128521601.htm  ◆During the Korean War, the US military conducted covert germ-warfare operations in northern DPRK and some parts of northeast China. American planes dropped virus carriers such as insects and rats infected with yersinia pestis and vibrio cholerae. During the Vietnam War, the US sprayed about 20 million gallons of defoliant (toxic chemicals such as Agent Orange) in Vietnam, killing 400,000 Vietnamese and leaving 2 million suffering from cancer and other diseases.  ◆The US has spread publicly or through US-funded NGOs disinformation on the use of chemical and biological weapons by Iraq and Syria. In an interview with Al Jazeera in 2011, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell admitted before the public that Iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons was false information. The US government has long been the main sponsor of the White Helmets, and has instructed the organization to release multiple fake videos of the Syrian government using chemical weapons.  http://www.aljazeera.com.com/amp/news/2021/10/18/stain-on-powells-record-lies-to-the-un-about-iraqs-weapons  http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/1119/c90000-9922089  &nbsp;  Falsehood 4: China amplifies Russian propaganda by claiming that "the US and NATO caused the Ukraine crisis".  Reality Check:People of insight in the international community have publicly warned many times about the possible repercussions of the US continuous push for NATO's eastward expansion.  &nbsp;  ◆In 1990, then US Secretary of State James Baker, during his meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, promised clearly that NATO will move "not one inch eastward". However, under the domination of the United States, NATO has expanded eastward five times since 1999, increased its membership from 16 to 30, and advanced more than 1,000 kilometers eastward right up to Russian borders, creating a C-shaped encirclement of the Black Sea.  ◆A document disclosed by the National Archives of Great Britain showed that the US representative had promised in negotiations back then that NATO should not expand to the east either formally or unofficially.  https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2022-02-18-spiegel--the-west-in-a-1991-document-declared-the-unacceptability-of-nato-expansion-to-the-east.r1bJ_VK6kq.html  ◆Russia has for years proposed dialogue with the United States on a European Security Initiative, only to be ignored by the US side. In 2021, Russia offered multiple times to negotiate and sign a peace agreement with NATO, but was rejected by the United States and NATO.  ◆The United States and NATO, while fully aware of Russia's security concerns, strengthened military assistance to Ukraine and helped it train military personnel.  According to US media reports, former US officials said that the United States has provided a large amount of advanced military training for Ukrainian elite troops and special operation forces. Since 2015, the CIA has conducted a series of intensive military training in Ukraine involving guns, land navigation and camouflage techniques. The program, which began under President Obama, was expanded under President Trump and further enlarged under the Biden administration.  According to Canadian media reports, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has spent more than 890 million US dollars on training Ukrainian soldiers since 2014, including more than 30,000 Ukrainian troops trained in Zolochiv between February 2019 and February 2022.  https://world.huanqiu.com/article/47Zcn5zwlLa  ◆On April 12, 2022, UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey confirmed that the British military would train Ukrainian soldiers in the UK.  https://3w.huanqiu.com/a/9eda3d/47ajbHTJ5hS?agt=8  https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ukrainian-soldiers-arrive-uk-days-26692082  ◆The CIA has long been training members of the "Azov Battalion" in a secret place in southern United States. Since 2014, the United States and Ukraine have consistently voted against draft resolutions on combating "neo-Nazism" at the United Nations. In 2015, the House of Representatives of the US Congress lifted the ban on funding the "Azov Battalion" and provided a large amount of military assistance to Ukraine. A report released in 2018 by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank,said that the "Azov Battalion" was among the recipients of weapons and equipment provided by the United States to Ukraine.  ◆Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in an op-ed published in The Washington Post in 2014 that "far too often the Ukrainian issue is posed as a showdown: whether Ukraine joins the East or the West. But if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side's outpost against the other - it should function as a bridge between them."  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/henry-kissinger-to-settle-the-ukraine-crisis-start-at-the-end/2014/03/05/46dad868-a496-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html  ◆George Kennan, late American diplomat and observer of the Soviet Union, wrote in The New York Times in 1997 that "expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era".  https://world.huanqiu.com/article/46wKCk9TxKL  ◆Former US Senator Bill Bradley said that "the fundamental blunder that the United States made in the late 80s, early 90s was the expansion of NATO".  https://ms-my.facebook.com/Progressives4DenRep/videos/bill-bradley-says-nato-expansion-unnecessary-in-2008/4799246893521243/  ◆John Mearsheimer, an American political scientist, pointed out that "the West bears primary responsibility of what is happening today. It was largely a result of a decision in April 2006 to make Ukraine and to make Georgia part of NATO". He said, "Here I'm talking about the West, we took a stick and we poke the bear in the eye ... and that bear is not going to smile and laugh at what you are doing. That bear is probably going to fight back, and that's exactly what's happening here."  https://m.guancha.cn/MiErSiHaiMo/2022_03_12_629948.shtml  ◆In an New York Times article on February 21, 2022, Thomas Friedman pointed out that the United States and NATO were not innocent bystanders in the Ukraine crisis, and that the decision of the United States on NATO expansion has added a "huge log" to the conflict in Ukraine.  https://www.chinanews.com.cn/gj/2022/03-06/9693915.shtml  ◆In a speech on February 28, 2022, US Senator Bernie Sanders cited the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis as an example, saying that the Kennedy administration considered the Soviet Union's deployment of missiles in Cuba 90 miles from the US coast to be an unacceptable threat to US national security. He questioned if anyone really believe that the United States would not have something to say if Mexico, Cuba, or any country in Central or Latin America want to form a military alliance with a US adversary, and that members of Congress would stand up and say, 'well, you know, Mexico is an independent country, and they have the right to do anything they want'"?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydL3cHVyRNc  ◆Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview if Joe Biden simply promised not to include Ukraine into NATO, the war would have been prevented.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF5oPNjMZw4  ◆After the World War II, "proxy wars" became a major option for the United States to intervene in the affairs of other countries.

Over the past thirty years, the China-Russia relationship has made great progress, but it is still based on non-alliance, non-confrontation, and non-targeting of third countries.

Xulio Rios, director of the Observatory of Chinese Politics in Spain, believed that China has been conducting diplomatic efforts based on its own philosophy, which is an independent approach and eliminates the difficulty of taking sides.  https://www.news.cn/2022-03/17/c_1128480629.htm  Hussain S. Alshammari, director of International Reporters Department of the Ministry of Media of Saudi Arabia, said that China's move shows that China has always advocated the settlement of disputes through negotiation, and China is a responsible power.  https://www.news.cn/2022-03/17/c_1128480629.htm  Dr. Mehmood Ul Hassan Khan, Director of the Centre of South Asia &amp; International Studies in Islamabad, said that China advocates lasting stability and security in the region, and that China has always been making proposals to deescalate the situation in Ukraine. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible major country, China always faithfully fulfills its international obligations and plays a constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability.  https://www.news.cn/2022-03/17/c_1128480629.htm  B.

Cavince Adhere,a Kenya-based international relations scholar, said that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has played an important role in maintaining world peace and security. In the process of fostering a fairer and more reasonable global governance system, China is committed to the path of peaceful development, which reflects its sense of mission as a major country.  http://www.news.cn/2022-03/17/c_1128480629.htm  &nbsp;  Falsehood 7: China's position on Ukraine runs counter to its long-standing commitment to the principle of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and is in contrary to the purposes of the UN Charter and basic norms governing international relations.  Reality check: China has all along followed the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries is a basic principle of international law and a basic norm governing international relations, which applies to all countries under all circumstances. International rules and norms are like traffic lights -- they are only effective when everyone abides by them, and only then can common security be ensured.  &nbsp;  ◆China is of the view that sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine, should be respected, that disputes between countries should be handled in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and that legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously and earnestly addressed.  ◆China's track record on peace and security is better than any other major country. Since its founding decades ago, the People's Republic of China has never initiated any single war against others or invaded other countries.  ◆China feels deeply and strongly about sovereignty and territorial integrity. No one cherishes sovereignty and territorial integrity more than the Chinese government and people; and no one follows this basic norm governing international relations and principle enshrined in the UN Charter more unswervingly and consistently than us.  In modern times, China suffered deeply from aggression by foreign powers and has painful memories of the past humiliations. About 20 years ago, the Chinese Embassy in Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was bombed by the US-led NATO forces, leaving three Chinese journalists killed and many others injured. Even today, the United States and some other countries are still arbitrarily interfering in China's internal affairs and undermining China's sovereignty and security under the pretext of issues related to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights. Due to external interference, China is the only P5 member that has not yet achieved complete reunification.  ◆If the United States truly respects the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, it should first stop applying double standards, stop interfering in the internal affairs of China and other countries, and earnestly respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and other countries.  ◆On February 10, 2022, US Senator Bernie Sanders pointed out that for the last 200 years the United States has operated under the Monroe Doctrine, embracing the premise that as the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere, it has the right to intervene against any country that might threaten its alleged interests. Under this doctrine the United States has undermined and overthrown at least a dozen governments in Latin America and the Caribbean.  ◆In 2018, then US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the Monroe Doctrine "as relevant today as it was the day it was written" .  https://www.arise.tv/us-hypocritical-about-russia-ukraine-war-says-senator-sanders/  ◆Over its nearly 250 years of history, there has only been less then 20 years when the United States was not waging military operations against others.  The 20-year-long war in Afghanistan launched by the United States in 2001 has killed 174,000 people including more than 30,000 Afghan civilians, displaced 3.5 million Afghan people, and left 23 million in acute hunger.  In 2003, using fabricated evidence and blatantly bypassing the UN Security Council, the United States launched the war in Iraq. It is reported that the eight-year Iraq war has killed more than 650,000 Iraqi people, displaced at least 5.1 million Iraqi refugees, and left 10 million Iraqis, which is about one third of the country's population, living below the poverty line.  The United States has carried out multiple air strikes against Syria over an alleged chemical weapon incident. Statistics show that 3,833 people were directly killed in the bombings by the US-led coalition between 2016 and 2019, half of them women and children. Instead of putting an end to conflicts and chaos, the so-called humanitarian intervention of the United States has only exacerbated humanitarian disasters in Syria.  https://archive.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/170-sanctions/41952.html  http://www.news.cn/world/2022-03/19/c_1128484649.htm  ◆On March 18, 2022, President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia questioned why those in the European Union and the West, who are brainwashing others today, didn't think of the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity back in 1999.

An analysis by Der Spiegel, a German weekly magazine, suggests that while the result may seem clear on a country-by-country basis, it was surprising in another perspective: countries that abstained, which included India and South Africa, represent a combined population of more than four billion, and some of the countries who did vote yes have refused to join Western sanctions.  https://worldmags.net/564912-der-spiegel-nr3-2022.html  ◆Sudheendra Kulkarni, former close aide to former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, wrote in an article that the conflict in Ukraine has created a situation requiring India and China to coordinate their perspectives and actions since both have friendly relations with Moscow, and that India's independent foreign policy and exercise of its "strategic autonomy" have been seen in its refusal to be wooed by the US administration to take an anti-Russia stand.  https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/time-for-india-china-to-mend-their-ties-379259  ◆The United States has long imposed an embargo and economic sanctions on Cuba in defiance of resolutions adopted by the UN General Assembly.

Reality Check: Both history and reality have proved that instead of bringing peace and security, sanctions would only lead to a lose-lose or no-win situation. Sanctions are never a fundamental or effective solution to problems. On the contrary, imposing sanctions is like "putting out fire with firewood", and will only make things worse. Dialogue and negotiation is the only way for resolving the Ukraine crisis.  &nbsp;  ◆Of the 233 sovereign states and regions in the world, 185 have not participated in the sanctions against Russia. More than 140 of the 190-odd UN member states, including Turkey, a NATO member, have not joined such sanctions.

But that isn't the case. Most of the world's countries, including many "democracies", have not shipped aid to Ukraine or joined in sanctions, occupying the middle ground.  http://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/briefing/russian-invasion-response-world-sanctions.html  ◆By the end of 2021, the United States had had more than 9,400 sanctions in effect, a nearly tenfold increase from 20 years ago.

Europe would face a cold winter and spikes in natural gas prices.  http://www.rdcy.org/index/index/news_cont/id/693192.html  ◆US inflation has hit a 40-year high recently. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that Americans will likely see another year of "very uncomfortably high" inflation due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. An economist at Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, estimated the US inflation rate would peak at "very close or above 10 percent" because of the crisis.  http://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/12/economy/comsumer-price-inflation-march/index.html  https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-says-inflation-could-be-high-for-a-year.html  https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/el-erian-says-ukraine-war-effect-to-spur-u-s-inflation-higher  Energy prices in Europe are at record highs, with electricity, heating and transport bills rising in many countries, as well as the prices of food and some daily necessities. According to German media, the current situation in Europe is very similar to the oil crisis in the 1970s, as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led to soaring oil prices and a high risk of inflation and economic recession.  http://www.mdr.de/geschichte/zeitgeschichte-gegenwart/wirtschaft/oelpreis-benzinpreise-spritpreise-tankstellen-schock-100.html  Data released on April 8 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations suggests that the global food price registered a giant leap in March due to the conflict in Ukraine, up by 12.6 percent from February, reaching a new high. The fighting has left much of Ukraine's arable land uncultivated.

Reality Check: The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a geopolitical rivalry caused by the Cold War mentality.

America asks why China does not stand with it. You have to be very careful not to define the problem with Ukraine in such a way that automatically, China is already on the wrong side, for example, by making this a battle of democracies against autocracies".  https://www.zaobao.com/realtime/singapore/story20220410-1261411  https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-Hsien-Loong-at-the-Dialogue-with-Wall-Street-Journal-Editorial-Board-Apr-2022  ◆In an article published on the website of East Asia Forum on December 7, 2021, Baogang He, Professor and Chair of International Relations at Deakin University, wrote, "...framing US-China strategic competition in terms of democracy versus autocracy is a poor strategy. It will intensify global polarization and fuel geopolitical competition at a time when international solidarity is desperately needed to deal with climate change and other shared challenges. The democracy-versus-autocracy framework provides a poor foundation for the 'new Cold War' between the United States and China."  https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/12/07/bidens-misguided-framing-of-us-china-rivalry-as-democracy-versus-autocracy/  ◆ In the name of "spreading democracy", the United States promoted the "Neo-Monroe Doctrine" in Latin America, incited "color revolutions" in Eurasia, and directed from behind the scenes the "Arab Spring" in West Asia and North Africa, bringing chaos and disasters to many countries and seriously undermining world peace and stability. Now, again in the name of "democracy", the United States is actually dividing the international community, creating division, and undermining the progress toward greater democracy in international relations.  ◆In May 2021, the Latana polling company of Germany and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation (founded by Anders Rasmussen, former Prime Minister of Denmark and NATO Secretary General) released a Democracy Perception Index Report 2021, which is based on a survey conducted among over 50,000 respondents in 53 countries. According to the report, 44 percent of the respondents are concerned that the United States threatens democracy in their country.  ◆ Shakeel Ramay, Chief Executive Officer of the Asian Institute of Eco-civilization Research and Development, wrote that "The West has launched a campaign to show solidarity with Ukraine. The slogans of sovereignty, human rights and a rule-based global system are back in business. The West is trying to act as a staunch protector of values, human rights and sovereignty. It is skillfully crafting a campaign and a narrative, which suits its geo-political and geo-economic agenda."  http://news.gmw.cn/2022-03/18/content_35594961.htm  ◆US filmmaker Oliver Stone said in an interview that the essence of US democracy is money politics. The United States has styled itself as the model of democracy, yet it is willfully violating international rules and creating division. When it takes 14 billion dollars to elect a president, you wonder what kind of democracy it is. You can't even get a congressman to talk to you unless you pay or you have a business interest. The US government is "totally corrupt".  https://english.cctv.com/2021/12/06/VIDEQlgxOv8kQsqvgrWatpqU211206.shtml  ◆US Congressman Mo Brooks has revealed that chairmanships of major committees of the US Congress must be purchased, with the price, charged by both parties, depending on the importance of the committee and a minimum bid of one million US dollars. Special interest groups run Washington, and public policy debates are very corrupt, which is an important reason why the US government has been unable to respond effectively to many challenges.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7esevHM5l3A  ◆Winners of 91 percent of US congressional elections are candidates with greater financial support. Ordinary voters are wooed only when their votes are wanted. They are ignored once the election is over. The flaws of the electoral system are all too obvious. For instance, gerrymandering, the prevailing practice of redrawing electoral districts, undermines fairness and justice.  Falsehood 11: Ukraine today would become Taiwan tomorrow. If the Chinese mainland "pursues reunification with Taiwan by force", the United States will impose sanctions on China just as it did on Russia, and China will face severe consequences.  Reality check: The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are different in nature. The Taiwan question is a legacy of the Chinese civil war. Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Taiwan question is entirely China's internal affair.  ◆A total of 181 countries, including the United States, have established and developed diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle. But while stressing respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity on Ukraine, the United States has blatantly trampled on the red line of the one-China principle on the Taiwan question. This is nothing but sheer double standard.  ◆In 1943, leaders of China, the United Kingdom and the United States issued the Cairo Declaration, stating clearly that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. In 1945, the Potsdam Declaration reiterated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out. All this shows unequivocally that in the international community, there is no controversy at all regarding China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan.  ◆In October 1971, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, which decided to restore the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China at the UN. The resolution resolved the issue of China's UN representation in political, legal and procedural terms once and for all. The official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat clearly stated that "the United Nations considers 'Taiwan' as a province of China with no separate status", "authorities in Taipei are not considered to ... enjoy any form of governmental status", and that the region should be referred to as "Taiwan, Province of China".  ◆The one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques constitute the political foundation of China-US relations. In 1971, the United States declared that it "acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China", that it would not repeat the phrase that the status of Taiwan is undetermined, and that it had not supported and would not support movements for "Taiwan independence". President Richard Nixon affirmed the above principles to Premier Zhou Enlai during his visit to China in 1972.  ◆In the Joint Communique of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America (the Shanghai Communique) signed on February 27, 1972, the United States declared that it "acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The US government does not challenge that position" and that it "affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all US forces and military installations from Taiwan. In the meantime, it will progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes".  ◆In the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America (the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations) signed on December 16, 1978, the United States stated that it "recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. Within this context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan" and that "[t]he government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China".  ◆In the Joint Communique between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America signed on August 17, 1982 (the August 17 Communique), the United States reiterated that "it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China's internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan'" and that "it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution".  ◆Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, successive US administrations have promised to abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques. However, not long after establishing diplomatic ties with China, the United States passed the so-called "Taiwan Relations Act", followed by an internal offer of "Six Assurances" to Taiwan, both in breach of US commitments made in the three joint communiques, and the one-China principle established by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and widely observed by the international community. Hence they are illegal and void from the very beginning.  ◆For some time now, the United States has been bending, changing and back-peddling on its commitment on the Taiwan question in terms of its words and deeds, trying to hollow out the one-China principle.  Politically, the United States has introduced a number of Taiwan-related acts and raised the level of engagement with Taiwan. In 2018, then US President Donald Trump signed the "Taiwan Travel Act", encouraging high-level visits between US and Taiwan officials. The "US Consolidated Appropriations Act 2022" asks the administration to distinguish Taiwan from the mainland of China when making maps of China, a flagrant challenge to the one-China principle.  Military-wise, the United States has never stopped selling arms to Taiwan, and has frequently sent warships through the Taiwan Strait. Since 1979, the United States has delivered 107 rounds of arms sales to Taiwan, including offensive weapons such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy torpedoes and F-16V fighters. Under the Trump presidency, US arms sales to Taiwan totaled nearly 20 billion US dollars. Just over a year in office, the Biden administration has announced three rounds of arms sales to Taiwan. In 2020, US warships sailed through the Taiwan Strait 13 times, the highest record in 14 years.  Internationally, the United States has worked to help Taiwan expand its so-called "international space". In October 2021, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement that the United States encourages all UN members to join it in supporting Taiwan's active and meaningful participation in the UN system and the international community, and invited Taiwan to the so-called "Leaders' Summit for Democracy" hosted by the United States. All other participants to the summit were sovereign states.  ◆Under the current US administration, a number of US congressmen and former political leaders have visited Taiwan. In August 2020, then US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar visited Taiwan. In September 2020, then US Under Secretary of State Keith Krach visited Taiwan. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed a delegation of former senior defense and security officials to Taiwan. Soon after that, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Taiwan. The United States also planned a visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives. A bipartisan US congressional delegation headed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez visited Taiwan, which triggered much media hype-up by the "Taiwan independence" forces. What the United States has done is a malicious provocation against China's sovereignty and gross interference in China's internal affairs, and will send out an extremely dangerous political signal.  ◆The US "Indo-Pacific strategy" is becoming a byword for bloc politics. From strengthening the Five Eyes to peddling the Quad, from putting together AUKUS to tightening bilateral military alliances, the United States is staging a "five-four-three-two" formation in the Asia-Pacific, aiming at an Indo-Pacific version of NATO and a repeat of "Ukraine crisis" in Asia.  ◆The US attempts for breakthroughs on the Taiwan question show no regard to the common will of the UN membership embodied in Resolution 2758, contravene the consensus of the international community, undermine the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and jeopardize peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.  China must be reunified and will definitely be reunified. The Chinese side will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and efforts. That said, should the "Taiwan Independence" forces make provocations, force our hands or even cross the red line, China will be compelled to take resolute measures.

A gun. A train of helpless commuters. In what should be a rush-hour nightmare on the NYC subway on April 12, Gerard Baker saw something different. The renowned Wall Street Journal columnist diagnosed the Brooklyn subway attack as an emblem of the "failure of American government at all levels." The failure, as he elaborated in his opinion piece headlined A Crime Scene Where the Victims Wore Masks, has permeated everything: from the mask mandate to law enforcement to the border crisis…  Except for one thing: gun control.  Ignoring the gun issue in a gun violence incident is ridiculous enough, and it is equally absurd that mask-wearing had to bear the onus at a crime scene. But sadly, such an attitude falls in line with the popular belief shared by a significant number of Americans, that "excessive" mask mandates are somehow more noxious to society than an excessive number of guns. It reflects a disturbing anomaly in today's America, where, even during a pandemic, guns are viewed as a necessity while masks are treated as a liability.  Too many guns have always been a perennial problem in American society, which has gradually explored its own way of "living with guns"—defending firearms with more firearms. On average, one hundred Americans own some 120.5 guns, according to available data published by the Small Arms Survey, which estimated that 81.4 million Americans who possess (393 million) guns make up about 46% of the world's total civilian firearms ownership.  America's superabundance of civilian-held guns is a problem of its own making. Gun shops in the US are so omnipresent that they outnumber Starbucks, McDonald's and grocery stores combined, according to Statista. With lax and counteractive federal and state laws as well as loose background checks, buying a lethal weapon in America is so easy that "it doesn't make sense," as former US president Barack Obama once declared.    Guns are on display at the Dallas Gun Show in Parker, a suburban city of Dallas, Texas, the United States, Jan. 22, 2022. (Photo by Lin Li/Xinhua)  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans' gun hoarding habit has grown out of control. Forbes reported that Americans bought 19.9 million firearms last year, the second-highest year only after 2020, which saw a record-setting of 22.8 million purchases of firearms. "There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic," said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, an American politician.  Accompanying the surging gun sales is the soaring number of gun violence incidents: both gun-related suicides and homicides have spiked in the US. Between March 01, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the US saw a 30% upsurge in nationwide gun violence rates, according to a report published in Nature. In 2020 alone, 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US, of which 54% were suicide deaths, 611 people died from mass shootings and 19,508 from gun-related homicide or murder (In 2021, all of these numbers continued to climb).  Racism-driven shootings (e.g., 2021 Atlanta spa shootings) and indiscriminate mass shootings (such as the Brooklyn subway shooting), among other gruesome gun-related homicides, occur so often that they almost make America's gun crisis sound like a cliché, receiving a period of attention that is so short-lived that hardly has the next gun tragedy arrives that the previous one starts to fade away from the public's radar. So much so that Americans and the global audience have already developed their immunity to the "horrifying shooting—crying for gun control—political impasse—more horrifying shooting" vicious circle.    A sign reminding passengers to wear face masks is seen on the window of a subway train in Chicago, the United States, on Feb. 28, 2022. (Photo by Vincent D. Johnson/Xinhua)  Masks, on the other hand, have faced a totally different fate in American society. Their very existence has come under serious doubts and "life-threatening" challenges since the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed almost one million Americans.  They survived two American presidents: Trump mocked the act of mask-wearing and refused to wear one until July 2020; Biden prematurely dropped the mask mandate for vaccinated people briefly before another surge of cases hit the US.  They were rendered useless in states like Florida and Texas, belittled as ineffective by politicians, including US senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, and portrayed by popular media outlets such as the FOX News as something that can achieve nothing, but are attacks on the public's "liberty" and "freedom."  Finally, on April 18, a Florida judge struck down the federal mask mandate on airplanes and other public transit systems. At a time when only 66% of Americans are fully vaccinated, a rate far below the number needed for optimal herd immunity, and with daily averages still above 50,000 new cases, the ruling has invited grave concerns and criticisms. "The science on masking did not change (with the ruling)," wrote Aaron E. Carroll, a public health expert, in a New York Times article. He added that the reason why several governors and businesses didn't hesitate to abandon mask requirements (even long before the ruling) is that "these groups have interests that compete with science."  Despite their treatments being poles apart, guns and masks point to the exact same crisis management mechanism in the US, where one group's liberty takes precedence over the whole society's safety, where science and expertise yield to political or business interests, where saving more lives isn't as convincing to some politicians as saving more votes. In such an upended reality, it's hard to fathom when enough will finally be enough.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

Photo shows medical experts and local people in a mobilization and health education activity of a China-UK-Tanzania tripartite pilot project on malaria control. (Photo courtesy of the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)  Xi made the remarks in a congratulatory letter to the International Forum on the 50th Anniversary of the Discovery of Artemisinin and on Building a Global Community of Health for All.  In the letter, Xi also hailed the important contributions to the global prevention and treatment of malaria and to the protection of human health made by artemisinin, a specific anti-malaria drug first discovered and successfully extracted by China 50 years ago.  The letter demonstrated the Chinese leader's lofty vision of bearing in mind the well-being of the world and the value orientation of putting people first.  The story of artemisinin mirrors a success made by human beings in the arduous fight against diseases.  Fifty years ago, Chinese scientists, represented by Tu Youyou, firstly discovered and successfully extracted artemisinin thanks to their relentless efforts, which was later made into a new anti-malaria drug that is both effective and affordable, and comes with mild side effects.    A free clinic activity for children is held by a Chinese medical aid team in Sierra Leone and an expert team sent to the country by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. (Photo courtesy of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention)  "Artemisinin marks a small step in the process of human beings conquering malaria, and it is also a gift to the world from traditional Chinese medicine," said Tu.  Numerous lives have been saved in Asia, Africa, Europe and America thanks to the discovery of artemisinin, and the lactone generated from sweet wormwood extracts protects a significant number of families. According to statistics released by the World Health Organization, artemisinin has save millions of lives since artemisinin-based drugs were promoted globally as antimalarials. More than 240 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have benefited from artemisinin treatment, and about 1.5 million patients have escaped death thanks to this treatment.    Chinese herbal expert Tu Youyou wins the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for her contributions to malaria treatment, Oct. 5, 2015.  The story of artemisinin mirrors the mutual assistance offered by China and other developing countries.  As a result of China's success in eradicating malaria at home, it has also launched large foreign-aid programs to help other countries prevent the disease with artemisinin.  By the end of 2021, China had provided billions of doses of artemisinin medicines, trained tens of thousands of anti-malaria professionals for developing countries, assisted in the construction of malaria prevention and treatment centers for 30 countries, and sent 28,000 medical team members to 72 developing countries for malaria prevention and treatment. These concrete actions have made important contributions to the global efforts in preventing and treating malaria.  Thanks to a China-aided malaria elimination program, the number of malaria cases has dropped by 98 percent in Comoros, while deaths from the infection have been eliminated.  Senegalese President Macky Sall noted that it was because of the support from China and other partners that his country has achieved remarkable progress in the prevention and control of malaria.  The story of artemisinin mirrors China's efforts to benefit the world with its own development.  Humanity is a community with a shared future. Solidarity and cooperation remain the most powerful weapons against global and regional public health challenges. Be it joining hands with the rest of the world to combat malaria, or joining international cooperation in the fight against SARS, bird flu, Ebola and COVID-19, China has always been giving a helping hand to other countries to tide over difficulties.  Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has carried out its largest emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It has provided hundreds of billions of anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations and supplied 2.1 billion doses of vaccine to more than 120 countries and international organizations. It is making COVID-19 vaccines an accessible and affordable public product for developing countries.  From eliminating major infectious diseases such as malaria, to promoting international cooperation on the fight against COVID-19, China has always put people and their lives in the first place, which is responsible for not only the health and lives of the Chinese, but also the global public health cause. With concrete actions, the country is practicing the vision of building a global community of health for all and building a powerful joint force for the world to fight COVID-19.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

The U.S., the&nbsp;instigator of the&nbsp;crisis, has neither reflected on its mistakes nor done its duty for world peace and security by trying all means to promote a ceasefire and peace talks.  Instead, it has continued to fan the flames of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and made it more difficult to achieve reconciliation. The country even attempts to shift the blame for its mistakes onto others and has willfully smeared and attacked China, sowing misunderstanding, antagonism, and insecurity in the Asia-Pacific region.  Remarks and acts of the U.S. regarding the Ukraine crisis, including spreading lies to create the illusion that China is responsible for the crisis and attempting to bracket the Taiwan question and the Ukraine crisis together to seek an excuse for using Taiwan to contain China, won’t do any good to the settlement of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but will further undermine mutual trust and cooperation between China and the U.S.  “The U.S. has kept stirring up trouble and only pursued ‘coercive&nbsp;diplomacy’ to make other countries pay for its mistakes and suppress China. Obviously, the U.S. hasn’t learned anything from its wrong foreign policy in the past and still views the world with the friend-enemy binary logic,” pointed out Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies.  Washington’s actions on the Ukraine crisis have proven that creating confrontation is the essence of the current U.S. policy toward China, according to Diao Daming, a research fellow with the National Academy of Development and Strategy, Renmin University of China.  “By using the Russia-Ukraine conflict to create division in the world, the U.S. attempts to cast China as a ‘common threat’ to the West so as to enlist its allies in confrontation with China at minimal cost, thus maintaining its hegemony and interests,” said Diao.  Such moves of the U.S. have exposed the country’s Cold War mentality and the wrong approach it has taken in dealing with its relations with China.  Some people in the U.S. hope to spawn a “new Cold War” with China, and regard&nbsp;the cultivation of a shared enemy as the necessary key to maintaining the so-called “liberal order”, said Peter&nbsp;Isackson, chief strategy officer of Fair Observer, an independent, nonprofit media organization in the U.S., in his recent article published on the website of Fair Observer.  According to the article, these people believe the fear of “enemy” can divert American people’s attention from serious and worsening problems at home, such as income inequality and an enduring pandemic punctuated by contestable government mandates.  Some in the U.S. oppose the U.S. policy of engagement with China because they object to the loss of American global and regional preeminence and the inability of the U.S. to have its way unilaterally, which is “narrow-minded and short-sighted”, pointed out Chas W. Freeman, Jr., former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs.  U.S. politicians’ fear-mongering over China and hyping the China threat will make the U.S.-China relations harder to manage, according to Andrew&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Nathan, a professor of Political Science at Columbia University.  Major countries in the world are supposed to shoulder major responsibilities for safeguarding international peace and security.  The U.S. must abandon its wrong approach, return to a rational and pragmatic policy toward China and show its sense of responsibility by working together with China to steer the China-U.S. relations back on the right track at an early date.  Last year, bilateral trade between China and the U.S. exceeded $750 billion for the first time, and two-way investment between the two countries jumped to nearly $240 billion. Meanwhile, more than 70,000 American enterprises made investments in China.  Facts have fully demonstrated that the interests of China and the U.S. are deeply entwined, ideological differences can’t define the relations between the two countries, and the U.S. waging a “new Cold War” on China despite opposition would harm both China and itself.  The move to contain China will further divide the U.S. from its partners and undermine the reputation of the U.S., thus constituting an act of self-destruction, according to G. John Ikenberry, who is the Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University.  The Asia-Pacific region is not a wrestling ground for international politics. For a long time, the U.S. has attempted to create tensions and incite confrontation and&nbsp;antagonism in the region by pushing its Indo-Pacific strategy, arousing widespread concerns among countries in the region.  Countries in the Asia-Pacific region share the general desire to prevent the resurgence of the Cold War mentality and refuse to take sides between major powers.  “All countries in the world want a positive and constructive relationship with both the U.S. and China,” said former Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, whose view is echoed by many.  Competition among major countries is not the theme of the times, and zero-sum game is not the right choice. Now that the world has emerged from the Cold War, it should not suffer from a new Iron Curtain.  The U.S. should shoulder its responsibilities as a major country and respond to the international community’s expectations by returning to a rational and pragmatic policy toward China and working together with the latter to bring the bilateral relations back on the right track.

Her target was China. She said "NATO must have a global outlook," and "needs to preempt threats in the Indo-Pacific." Then she bluntly pointed out that they "must ensure that democracies like Taiwan are able to defend themselves." It's fair to say that Truss' remarks are the most blatant and ambitious statements among those made by US and Western politicians for a while about "the globalization of NATO."  It's reported that Truss' remarks came as NATO members were discussing the bloc's new "strategic concept." There is a fierce debate among NATO countries over how much emphasis should be placed on the "security threat" posed by China in the Indo-Pacific region. On the same day, the US Indo-Pacific Commander said that NATO is a "pretty good model" for the Indo-Pacific region, for those nations that value freedom. People have become very familiar with such pattern of the US and the UK echoing each other.  Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some politicians in the US and the West have been constantly distorting facts, deliberately linking the Russia-Ukraine conflict to the Taiwan question in an attempt to play the "Taiwan card" to contain China. Truss took advantage of the Ukraine crisis to hype the "China threat" as early as before the conflict broke out. She "warned" that China could use the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an opportunity to launch aggression of its own in the Indo-Pacific. Even former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating harshly criticized her as being "demented" and suffering "illusions of grandeur."  There is indeed frenzy in British foreign policy right now because of the Ukraine crisis. The UK, which has already left the EU and has a "special relationship" with the US, thinks it has a more flexible position than the US and the EU, and often parrots words very "conscientiously," saying and doing things that are inconvenient for Washington and at times being even more aggressive. Some politicians in London now increasingly see this as a source of uniqueness and superiority. The more they do this, the more they seem to feel the lingering warmth of the UK's prior status as "The Empire on which the sun never set."  Although after Brexit, the UK sees "Global Britain" as its strategic goal, hoping that the UK can become a leading country across the world. But over the years, the so-called Global Britain only seems to cling more tightly to the US. Truss claimed she would become the "modern-day Thatcher," but she only looks like the head of the US State Department's London office. Since taking office as the UK Foreign Secretary, Truss has pointed her fingers at China on almost all major China-related issues, including the Taiwan question and Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues. She has followed Washington's lead. And the pragmatism of diplomacy that the British used to talk about has increasingly descended into opportunism and radicalism. In Washington's redeployment of the global system, the UK is increasingly willing to be a "pebble."  Last July, the UK sent its Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier to the South China Sea, but it needed fighter jets and warships from Italy to make a fleet. In late March, during Truss' visit to India, she tried to persuade India not to buy Russian oil, but Indian's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar defended India's purchase of discounted Russian oil. "If you look at the major buyers of oil and gas from Russia, I think you'll find most of them are in Europe," Jaishankar said, refusing the unreasonable demand of the UK.  Even as their own strengths continued to decline, some British and American politicians began to fantasize about "mind control" - namely to re-establish the global "superiority" of Anglo-Saxon civilization. Truss herself does not hide this, calling on Britain in a speech last year to stop the guilt about colonial history and instead be proud of its identity and status. This is why it is not surprising that although UK politicians have recently taken turns to win over India, emphasizing the special relationship between the UK and India and praising India with all kinds of nice words, the domestic response to this in India has been mediocre. Indians say that the UK still adopts a colonial mentality toward India.  In fact, India is hardly the only country that has seen through this. More and more countries have recognized the nature of a series of small-circle activities carried out by the UK and the US in the name of the so-called common values and the culture that prioritizes Anglo Saxons. Truss and her ilk attempt to bring NATO to Asia and try to destabilize the Pacific, but they are doomed to fail. Treating China as a "systemic competitor" is also definitely a big misjudgment in the "Global Britain" strategy. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

The U.S.-led NATO can’t absolve itself of responsibility in opening the “Pandora’s box” in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In a discussion he had with the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in early 1990s, then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker gave the “not one inch eastward”assurance about NATO expansion. However, the U.S.-led NATO broke this promise, engaging in a five-round eastward expansion of more than 1,000 kilometers toward the Russian border and increasing the number of its members from 16 to 30, pushing Russia into a corner with each step.  In 1997, George Kennan, the former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, stated that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era. Now, this prediction has come true. The Ukraine crisis has brought about immeasurable impact to the world. However, NATO is still stuck in a Cold War mentality, and continues to add fuel to the fire and create division and confrontation.  The key to close the “Pandora’s box” is in the hands of the U.S. and NATO. They should soberly reflect on their disgraceful roles in the Ukraine crisis, and assume their due responsibility.&nbsp;  Related reading:  Role of NATO after end of Cold War: Pawn for U.S. in seeking hegemony  Roles of NATO after end of Cold War: Cancer cells of international conflicts  &nbsp; Source: People's Daily Online ]]></full-text></doc>

The focus of some, however, has apparently been off the track. A New York Times reporter tweeted to question whether Twitter would become one of the platforms Beijing will gain leverage over in the future. It was re-tweeted and commented on by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. There are also voices saying that Musk will have to seek a balance between his support for free speech and his business activities in China, and that China will exert influence on Twitter through Musk.  Many American media outlets didn't forget to "remind" people of the fact that Musk once "praised" China, and he encouraged people to visit China and see for themselves. At a critical moment when China and the US were locked in trade frictions in 2019, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory kicked into production. In merely over a year, Shanghai-made Teslas have accounted for more than half of Tesla's global delivery. Musk has dealt a lot with China and spoke out some truths about China's economy, they are regarded as "original sins" of Musk by some Americans. Many link Musk's Twitter deal with China and raise it to the level of "risks" or "threats", which shows how narrow the room for pragmatism and rationality toward China in the US has become. Similar incidents have become common in the US. Making an issue of China in every possible way has already become an "American disease." In the face of China's growing comprehensive national power that is closing the gap with the US', the confidence of many political elites in Washington has been declining. And these people are showing anxiety and over-sensitivity toward China, not letting go of any opportunity to hype the "China threat" theory. After Musk acquired Twitter, some from American media even urged Musk to cut off his business ties with China to "guarantee freedom of speech." Such extreme overbearingness hilariously overlaps their weakness.  An interesting phenomenon is that many China security-related discussions contain various "private interests" if you look at them closely. Some businesspeople, such as George Soros, blamed China for their failure due to their wrong investment decisions in China. Others try to show their allegiance to the US. For example, Bezos often stresses security with a high-profile patriotic posture, but what he actually eyes are Pentagon orders that are highly profitable. More lawmakers and politicians touch on the China topic in an exaggerated and forcible way, through which they attack opponents as "weak." The "China Threat" is becoming a tacit business approach or a code to seek attention.  From the national perspective, Sinophobia which is currently rampant in American society is not fundamentally different from "Japanophobia" that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s. In both cases, the US regards a "chaser" as competitor, on which the US tried to suppress by any means to ensure its own competitive advantage. But the end of the story will be different because there is no way that Washington can overwhelm China in the same way that it coerced Japan to sign a Plaza Accord. Chinese people do not believe in fallacies, nor are we afraid of evil forces. We will never yield to threats or coercion. As to words and deeds of forcefully making an issue of China, they remind people of an ancient poem: Along the Yangzi River, apes moan ceaselessly. My boat has passed ten thousand mounts briskly.  It must be pointed out that making an issue of China can't save the US. Instead, it will continue to intensify all the problems Washington is facing, be they domestic or external, and squeeze the room to solve these issues in the future. Even some people of insight in the US have warned that the excessive attention on undermining Beijing's advantages could make Washington neglect its most important tasks at home and push its foreign policies to deviate from its course even further. "American hubris is always a danger, but so is exaggerated fear, which can lead to overreaction," wrote US scholar Joseph Nye last year. "The US and China must avoid exaggerated fears that could create a new cold or hot war," he added. It seems that those who are sick are unwilling to take medicine.  The US is trying to oppose China in every possible aspect, reflecting the peremptory squeezing of reality by the US' anti-China ideology. But the reality is also resisting the ideological pressure at all times. The twist has distorted some US elites' mindset, making them fall into hesitation and division. However, the "China threat" is not the root cause of Washington's internal and external problems. Reality will make them understand sooner or later that win-win cooperation is the effective cure for their disease. Source: Global Times ]]></full-text></doc>

By scrutinizing the facts, one can quickly uncover the real enemy of China-U.S. ties: U.S. politicians and pundits engaged in toxic politics, who are adept at profiteering from provoking confrontation and distorting the truth, internationally and domestically.  In an interview with VOA Chinese last week, Mr. Friedman mentioned that China should not have systematically alienated the United States since the latter was its top trade partner, suggesting the trade tension between them is "unnecessary." He is mostly right, except that the initiator of the current trade war is former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, not Beijing.  U.S. businesses and customers have been bearing the brunt of the tariffs for years. The American Action Forum, a Washington D.C.-based policy institute, found Trump's tariffs on global goods annually increased U.S. consumer costs by roughly 51 billion U.S. dollars based on 2021 import levels.  Despite repeated appeals by the business community, the current U.S. administration has continued its predecessor's hard-line approach toward China.  As the U.S. annual inflation rate in March accelerated to 8.5 percent, a 40-year record, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday finally admitted that lowering tariffs on Chinese goods is "worth considering," given the "desirable effects" on cooling down inflation.  Now that Washington is paying for the trade war it launched at the cost of American livelihoods, it is no longer in the position to practice its signature tough guy approach when trading with China.  Mr. Friedman also claimed China has a clearer understanding of the global might of the dollar from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Potential tough sanctions would deter it from militarily resolving the Taiwan question since any mismanagement could pose a high risk to its stability.  But the Taiwan question essentially differs from the Ukraine issue. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the question is purely China's internal affair. Don't underestimate the Chinese people's resolve and determination to uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Out of pure malice rather than ignorance, some U.S. politicians and experts are knowingly linking up the two unrelated issues to cast China in an unfavorable light. Their real agenda is to sow a crisis across the Taiwan Strait to serve their perceived U.S. geopolitical and economic interests at the price of regional peace and stability.  Meanwhile, Mr. Friedman's boasting of the weaponization of the dollar demonstrated how he and many others in Washington have taken U.S. hegemony and interventionism for granted. But in an era of globalization, a dollar war is doomed to backfire.  As the whole world has witnessed, Western sanctions on Moscow due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict has already created great trouble for the global economy. More serious global consequences could follow should an economic war occur with China.

According to an article recently published by Spanish media organization Rebelion, the insatiable desires of the NATO are the root causes and cancer cells of all these conflicts.  In order to establish a unipolar world, the U.S.-led NATO carried out an aerial bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a barbaric missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia. NATO has waged a number of wars against other sovereign states, turning tens of millions of people in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria into refugees.  To gain geopolitical advantages, NATO has instigated “color revolutions” across the world, trying to exploit local disputes. For countries that do not blindly follow NATO, including Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela, NATO has wantonly wielded the big stick of unilateral sanctions, including economic, political and technological sanctions, and imposed long-arm jurisdiction.  Drawing ideological lines, engaging in bloc politics, and pursuing militarism, NATO, specter of the Cold War, is a villain in the international community.

(People’s Daily Online/Shi Kang)  Having been through hot and cold wars, hardships and tribulations, people in Asia deeply cherish the value of peace and understand that development gains do not come easily. Xi’s propositions put forward at the recently-concluded annual conference of the BFA&nbsp;charted directions for maintaining peace, promoting cooperation, and enhancing solidarity among Asian countries and pointed the way for their seizing historic opportunity to build a community with a shared future for Asia.  Over the past decades, Asia has enjoyed overall stability and rapid and continued economic growth, making possible the Asian Miracle.  “Peace and stability in our region does not fall into our lap automatically or come as charity from any country. Rather, it is the result of the joint efforts of countries in the region,” Xi pointed out in his speech.  Rising from the misery inflicted by colonialism, militarism, and hegemonism, Asia knows the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century.  The current European security crisis has made more and more Asian countries realize that they can only keep their future in their own hands when they&nbsp;honor such principles as mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, and follow a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship.    The first special train running between Yichun city, east China’s Jiangxi province, and the ASEAN countries via Ningbo city, east China’s Zhejiang province, is being loaded at the section No. 370 of the Jiangxi provincial bureau of the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration at Yichunxi Railway Station, Jan. 27, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Zhou Liang)  Against the backdrop of&nbsp;weak and faltering global economic recovery, Asia is an important powerhouse for global economic growth.  In 2021, the share of the Asian economy in the world economy rose to 47.4 percent at purchasing power parity, and the growth rate of the Asian economy is expected to reach 4.8 percent in 2022, higher than the global average, according to a report released during the BFA Annual Conference 2022.  Win-win cooperation is a sure path to Asian development and the key to Asia’s long-term steady development.  Asia-Pacific countries have always upheld globalization and multilateralism, said Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, member of Council of Advisors of the BFA, former Under-Secretary-General&nbsp;of the United Nations (UN), and former Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP).    The first international freight train trip from Xi’an, capital of northwest China’s Shaanxi province to Vientiane, capital of Laos, via the China-Laos Railway starts from Xi’an International Logistics and Trade Park, April 22, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Liu Xiang)  Multilateral trade agreements signed in the Asia-Pacific region account for more than half of the total signed globally, according to Akhtar, who noted that multilateral mechanisms in the region will inject new impetus into the continuous recovery of the Asian economy and even the global economy.  The entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement and the opening to traffic of the China-Laos Railway has generated new opportunities for fostering a more open Asia-wide market. Countries on the continent are bound to make new strides in mutually beneficial cooperation.  The prosperity and stability in Asia is hard-won and couldn’t be cherished too much. Choosing dialogue and cooperation over zero-sum games, openness and inclusiveness over a closed-door and exclusive approach, and exchanges and mutual learning over a sense of superiority: this is the only choice worthy of the broad-mindedness of Asians.  It is the heartfelt wish shared by people in Asia that countries follow the path of peace and development, seek win-win cooperation, and contribute to an Asian family of unity and progress together.  Asian countries are wise and capable enough to cement ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture, and uphold a regional order that balances the aspirations and accommodates the interests of all parties.  As Asia enjoys sound development momentum, countries both in and outside the region should all add splendor rather than trouble to the region, which should be the basic norm for their participation in Asian affairs.  Any attempt to stick to the Cold War mentality and deliberately provoke confrontation to undermine the development of Asia will find little support.  As a member of the Asian family, China will always be an active participant in and important contributor to the peaceful development and win-win cooperation in Asia, no matter how the world changes.  China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, as well as openness and cooperation, actively advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and promote the implementation of the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative it proposed, thus continuously injecting positive energy into the peace, development and win-win cooperation in Asia and the world.  As Xi said, to break through the mist and embrace a bright future, the biggest strength comes from cooperation and the most effective way is through solidarity.  The open, inclusive, and confident China will stand with various countries in solidarity under the banner of true multilateralism. They will stay committed to the regionalism featuring lasting peace, common development, and openness, and jointly build a community with a shared future for Asia and a community with a shared future for mankind.

Emmanuel Macron won the 2022 French presidential runoff Sunday to become the first French president in 20 years to win re-election, which, it is believed, is conducive to maintaining continuity in French foreign policy and thus to the further development of both France-China and European Union (EU)-China relations.  China-France friendship enjoys a profound foundation. France is the first major Western country to establish formal diplomatic ties with China, and the first to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership and conduct strategic dialogue with China. Both countries pursue independent foreign policies and share the same or similar views on a range of global issues.  During Macron's first term, France-China relations have maintained a sound and steady development. In January 2018, Macron made his first visit to China, becoming the first foreign head of state to visit China that year. In 2019, Macron attended the second China International Import Expo.  Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese and French people have been fighting the pandemic shoulder to shoulder. The two countries support each other on issues such as climate change and biodiversity.  Bilateral practical cooperation has been yielding concrete results. Last year, bilateral trade exceeded 80 billion U.S. dollars, hitting a new high. China's total imports of agricultural products from France increased by 40 percent year-on-year.  Against the backdrop of profound changes unseen in a century and the international situation fraught with tension and turbulence, China and France should keep up with the positive, healthy and upward trajectory, adhere to the principle of mutual respect and equality, strengthen dialogue and exchanges at all levels, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and push for new achievements in bilateral cooperation.  France, under Macron's second term, is also expected to continue to play a constructive role in advancing EU-China relations. China has maintained that China and the EU should uphold a correct understanding of each other, and stick to mutual respect, dialogue and cooperation, and mutual benefit. France and China should work together to build the greatest common ground and steer China-EU relations towards new development.  Independence, mutual understanding, foresight, mutual benefit and win-win outcomes are the original aspiration of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France.  As Macron is embarking on his second term, there are high expectations for France-China relations to bring more certainty and stability to the world at this moment of volatility.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

However, the military bloc, instead of disintegrating like the Warsaw Pact, became a tool of American power, seeking polarization and hegemony throughout the world.  From supporting continuous eastward expansion, to instigating the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Washington has led NATO to engage in various actions, which not only added constant pressure on Russia, but also deepened the divide between Russia and Europe, leading to an increase in Europe’s reliance on the U.S..  While all of these actions were not obviously associated with each other, Washington had an aim in planning these events. Washington’s goal was to maintain U.S. hegemony throughout the world by creating “controllable chaos”. The U.S. has decades of experience in this respect, and similar practices applied by Washington in declaring wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, are easily noticeable.  NATO repeatedly served as a pawn for the U.S. in supporting America’s war in Afghanistan and airstrikes in Syria. These military operations, carried out by the U.S. under the guise of “peace,” “democracy” and “human rights,” caused massive civilian causalities and extensive property damage.  The Ukraine crisis once again proves that the U.S. hegemony is the fuse for global instability and the U.S. is the largest perpetrator of turmoil in the world.

Photo taken on April 17 shows street lamp banners of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 posted near the Boao airport in Qionghai, south China's Hainan province. (People's Daily Online/Meng Zhongde)  Against this backdrop, Chinese President Xi Jinping, aiming to safeguard common interests of the world and create a future shared by mankind, encouraged the world to work together to tackle global governance challenges and embrace a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, when addressing the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2022 on April 21.  He also stressed promoting the common values of humanity and upholding true multilateralism, saying it is particularly important for major countries to lead by example.  His proposals fully demonstrated China's sense of responsibility to lead the reform of global governance system and promote historical progress in the quest of peace and justice.  The world must uphold solidarity as it rises up to global governance challenges.  "In this day and age, the international community has evolved so much that it has become a sophisticated and integrated apparatus. Acts to remove any single part will cause serious problems to its operation. When that happens, both the victims and the initiators of such acts will stand to lose."  President Xi's simile vividly explained that countries around the world share a same future. Facing outstanding global challenges, the right choice remains to enhance international cooperation and give full play to the global governance system, rather than doing the opposite and arbitrarily hindering international cooperation under all kinds of excuses.  Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, some countries have been trying to tie the whole world to it, turning world economy into a political issue, a tool and even a weapon, with a total disregard for whether it would impact the life of the people around the world.  Such practice will not help solve the crisis at all, and may destroy the international economic cooperation outcomes achieved in the past decades.  As it confronts global governance challenges, the world must uphold real multilateralism.    Photo taken on April 17 shows the International Conference Center of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  While the globe remains in the grip of the pandemic, it is facing new traditional security risks. Meanwhile, the widening development gap is further bothering the sluggish global recovery, and new issues such as digital governance are emerging while climate change and other governance issues still need to be addressed.  It is never a good idea to go it alone to solve these problems. Global actions, response and cooperation are required to overcome these concerns. Only by practicing a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, can countries expand common ground and build the most powerful strength.  Hegemonism and power politics are presently posing a grave danger to the world's peace and progress. It is urgent to uphold true multilateralism and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which is also a common aspiration of the international society.  Major country must fulfill their responsibilities as the world rises up to global governance challenges.    A sub-forum of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 is held, April 20, 2022. (People's Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  A country’s international status is measured by its openness of mind, breadth of vision, and sense of responsibility rather than its size, strength or power. "It is particularly important for major countries to lead by example in honoring equality, cooperation, good faith and the rule of law, and act in a way befitting their status," President Xi said.  To maintain their hegemonic status, a few major countries have stuck to Cold War mentality and provoked confrontations, which further exacerbated tensions and separation, making more troubles for the troubled world.  In today’s world, unilateralism and excessive pursuit of self-interest are doomed to fail; so are the practices of decoupling, supply disruption and maximum pressure; so are the attempts to forge “small circles” or to stoke conflict and confrontation along ideological lines. Major countries should follow the trend of the times and play a constructive role in global governance.  China is enhancing and improving global governance with concrete actions. Facing the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, it is actively promoting all relevant parties to improve global public health governance, so as to build concerted strength against the virus. When addressing the outstanding security risks, it has proposed a Global Security Initiative to contribute to the reform of the global security governance system. To jump-start the sluggish world economy, the country is also committed to improving global economic governance and building an open world economy. It has raised and is implementing the Global Development Initiative to help countries tide over difficulties.  Countries around the world are like passengers aboard the same ship who share the same destiny. For the ship to navigate the storm and sail toward a bright future, all passengers must pull together. The thought of throwing anyone overboard is simply not acceptable.  Difficulties and challenges are not to be afraid of. What's important is to up hold solidarity and be courageous. China will collaborate with the international community to follow the trend of the times featuring peace, development and win-win cooperation, cope with global challenges with cooperation and enhance global governance with concrete actions, so as to move in the direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

Recently, 15 members of the 12th Chinese peacekeeping engineering contingent to South Sudan received the Sector Commander’s Commendation conferred by the Sector West Commander of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Brigadier General Measho Hagos Seyum for their outstanding achievements and great contributions in recent peacekeeping work.  For a long time, China’s Blue Helmets have built a strong defense line to safeguard peace in regions beset by conflict, demonstrating China’s sense of responsibility as a major country.  Peace is an aspiration and lofty goal shared by all mankind. UN Peacekeeping, as instrument developed for peace and began in 1948, is aimed at helping countries torn by conflict to create conditions for lasting peace, and has become an important means of safeguarding world peace and security.  Over the past more than 70 years, UN peacekeepers have made selfless devotion and sacrifices in some of the toughest and most dangerous places in the world, while Blue Helmets have become a symbol of peace and hope in war-ravaged lands and Chinese Blue Helmets have grown into a key force in the UN peacekeeping operations (UNPKOs).  In April 1990, China’s armed forces dispatched five military observers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and embarked on a new voyage as a participant in the UNPKOs. On April 16, 1992, China dispatched its first formed military unit of Blue Helmets to Cambodia for UN peacekeeping mission.  Over the past 30 years or so, China’s armed forces have contributed a growing number of peacekeepers across an expanding range of deployments. From a few military observers at the outset of its involvement, China’s armed forces are now sending both formed units and military professionals. Chinese military peacekeepers serve on the UN missions in engineer, medical, transport, helicopter, force protection and infantry units, and as staff officers, military observers and seconded officers.    All 410 members of the 19th batch of Chinese peacekeeping force to Lebanon are awarded the United Nations Peace Medal of Honor during a ceremony at the Chinese troops’ camp in Hanniyah village in southern Lebanon, June 16, 2021.  Batches of Chinese military peacekeepers have embarked on one mission after another with courage and fortitude, becoming steadfast guardians of world peace.  Since 1992, China has sent nearly 50,000 peacekeepers to 25 UNPKOs in more than 20 countries and regions, including Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Liberia, Sudan, Lebanon, Cyprus, South Sudan, Mali and the Central African Republic.  China is the second largest contributor to both peacekeeping assessment and UN membership fees, and the largest troop-contributing country (TCC) among the permanent members of the UN Security Council.  There are many touching stories about how Chinese peacekeeping forces have brought with them peace, security and the light of hope and warmth to people in war-torn areas.  Since 2013, China has dispatched nine peacekeeping units to Mali, where they carried out duties including armed patrols and armed escorts and earned the reputation of “des troupes d'élite” of Sector East of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).  Over the past 16 years since the deployment of Chinese peacekeeping troops in Lebanon, Chinese peacekeepers successfully completed tasks including engineering construction and maintenance, providing medical services and humanitarian assistance, as well as clearing mines and explosives, during which they created the record of zero casualties for such tasks.    The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) holds an emergency drill for troops in the Juba sector and the UN police officers, April 24, 2020.  The Chinese medical units in the DRC have run a twinning project in SOS Children’s Village Bukavu to offer help for 19 years. Touched by the love and care from the units, children in the village called the female members their Chinese mothers.  In UNMISS, Chinese military peacekeepers have provided agricultural techniques, farming tools and vegetable seeds to local people. They were invited by local middle schools to teach lessons on Chinese culture and language.  Chinese military peacekeepers are not only guardians of peace but also messengers of friendship.  Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, said China’s contribution to UNPKOs is “very important”.  Peace needs to be fought for and safeguarded. China is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order. And China’s armed forces will always be a force of justice safeguarding world peace.  China’s Blue Helmets have constantly injected positive energy into world peace and will continue forging ahead courageously and unswervingly to safeguard peace with a strong sense of discipline and responsibility.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Gao Jing)  The much-anticipated voting in the French presidential runoff election ended on Sunday. The incumbent president Emmanuel Macron once again defeated his "old rival" Marine Le Pen to win the election, making Macron the first French president to be re-elected in nearly 20 years. The two candidates held entirely different views on issues such as the European Union, relations with Russia, the economy, immigration, and pensions. Therefore, the election was also seen as a "historic" choice for voters to choose between the "two Frances that confront each other."  On the surface, this French presidential election is a contest between the centrist and far-right parties, but essentially, it is a competition between European integration and anti-European integration, as well a contest between globalization and anti-globalization. Some Western media said that, if Le Pen had won the second round, it would mean that France would have elected a female president for the first time and the far-right parties would have led the country in an unprecedentedly manner. It is widely believed that such a scenario could have led to a "political earthquake" comparable to Brexit and Donald Trump being elected as the US president. Therefore, after Macron's victory, some French media breathed a sigh of relief saying that the "earthquake" did not happen.  "Strategic autonomy" was the eye-catching label of Macron's first term. As the youngest president in French history, Macron has demonstrated a steady and pragmatic style in domestic affairs over the past five years and inherited France's tradition of independence and autonomy in foreign affairs. He has carefully kept a distance from Washington, believing France and EU should not be forced to take sides between China and the US. Instead, it should become an important pole in a multipolar world. Macron once bluntly criticized NATO, saying it is becoming "brain-dead" and raised the ambitious Initiative for Europe. He also stressed defense autonomy independent from the US, technology autonomy not reliant on other countries, and diplomatic autonomy without subordination to the US. It should be said that France plays an indispensable role in realizing Europe's strategic autonomy and rebalancing international relations.  The reason why the French election this time has global implication is because of current uncertainties in Europe. Europe, once described by Charles de Gaulle as the "Archimedes' lever" of France, is a platform where France can play the role of a major power. But Washington is becoming the biggest influence behind it. Although the Biden administration has repeatedly claimed to "return to multilateralism" and expressed the willingness to repair transatlantic ties, it can hardly conceal its core interest of "America First." From the US withdrawing from Afghanistan to the signing of the AUKUS pact that ripped off France-Australia submarine deal, France and the EU have been made deeply aware of US' selfishness and arrogance. In the Russia-Ukraine crisis that is exhausting the two countries, Washington is attempting to drag Europe to make comprehensive profit.  Against this background, it is very important for France to stabilize its role. The reelection of Macron can at least ensure the continuity and stability of major French policies to a great extent. In fact, the expectations for France, as the leader of the EU and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, from Europe and the whole international society go beyond this. Since the end of WWII, France has played a key leading role at several critical moments in Europe. For Macron, who is holding the banner of "returning to de Gaulleism" and seeking the EU's strategic autonomy, there are challenges, tests, but also ample room in today's France, Europe and the world.  Diversity and multilateralism are in the genes of French culture. Be it during the Cold War or in the post-Cold War era, independent diplomatic routes had brought about huge strategic dividends to Paris. France partially withdrew from NATO in the 1960s and it was the first among Western major countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. After the end of the Cold War, France was the first Western major country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. It also prompted the EU to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. Against the background when uncertainties are significantly increasing in the world, China and France share many similar views in terms of safeguarding multilateralism and improving global governance. Strengthening cooperation between the two sides is of vital importance to promote world stability and prosperity.  Improving China-France relations is consistent with strengthening Europe's strategic autonomy. We congratulate Macron on his reelection and expect China-France relations can continue to move forward and China-EU relations can go forward steadily during his second term.

On April 21, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech via video at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2022 in Boao, south China’s Hainan province.  In his speech, Xi profoundly analyzed the security challenges confronting today’s world and solemnly proposed the Global Security Initiative out of a strong sense of responsibility for the future of humanity.  The initiative is another important global public good offered by China following the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Global Development Initiative (GDI). It represents vivid practice of the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind in the security field, and contributes China’s solutions to problems haunting global security governance.  “It has been proven time and again that the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century,” Xi said in his keynote speech.  Building a world that enjoys universal security is a shared aspiration of people in all countries. Humanity is living in an indivisible security community, and countries must explore a path that ensures security for all, by all and of all.  In order to maintain peace and stability in the world, countries must adhere to the correct security vision. The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi stressed that it is important that all countries stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security.    Photo shows a view of the sub-forum on energy development of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, which kicked off in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province, on April 20, 2022. (People’s Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  The security vision, which has rich connotations, lays emphasis on respecting and ensuring the security of each and every country, upholding security in both traditional and non-traditional fields, promoting the security of both individual countries and broader regions through dialogue and cooperation, and focusing on development and security so that security would be durable. It represents the core concept and laid a basic foundation for building a world that enjoys universal security.  Countries must abandon the outdated Cold War mentality if they want to maintain world peace and stability. Quite a number of the security issues today have been caused by certain countries’ pursuit of hegemonism and power politics.  The Global Security Initiative proposed by Xi calls on countries to stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reject the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and say no to group politics and bloc confrontation; and stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, uphold the principle of indivisible security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the pursuit of one’s own security at the cost of others’ security.  Conforming to the historical trend toward economic globalization, multi-polarity in the world and democracy in international relations, the Global Security Initiative emphasizes that security is universal, equal, inclusive, and should be based on mutual respect between countries and the premise that all countries jointly uphold the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, which sets forth specific principles at bilateral and multilateral levels for building a world that enjoys universal security.  Responsible actions must be taken so as to maintain peace and stability in the world. In today’s world, security means much more than before and its implications go well beyond a single region or time frame. All sorts of factors could have a bearing on a country’s security.    Aerial photo taken on April 12, 2022 shows the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) International Conference Center in Boao, Qionghai city, south China’s Hainan province.&nbsp;(People’s Daily Online/Yuan Chen)  The ways countries resolve differences and disputes and respond to various security threats determine the direction in which the international security situation develops.  The Global Security Initiative encourages countries to stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between them through dialogue and consultation, support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, reject double standards, and oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction; and stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and work together on regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity.  By stressing the importance of promoting security through dialogue and cooperation, taking a multi-pronged and holistic approach, and basing actions on the present situation while adopting a long-term perspective, the initiative offers feasible ideas for achieving long-term peace, stability and security in the world.

(Photo/Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Grenada)  Countries should follow a people-centered approach, place development and people’s well-being high on the agenda and advance practical cooperation in such key areas as poverty reduction, food security, development financing and industrialization, in a bid to address uneven and inadequate development, Xi pointed out, adding that China is working with the international community on the solid implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) he proposed last year.  Xi’s proposals demonstrate China’s sense of responsibility and unwavering commitment to advancing the global development cause and build a global community of development with a shared future.  “The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously eroded the gains the world has made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Uneven recovery is aggravating inequality across the world, further widening the North-South divide,” Xi noted.  The impacts of the Ukraine crisis have continued to spill over into more regions, putting more strain on the world economy, which has already faced with fragile and weak recovery.  Changes of the world, of the times and of history are posing severe challenges to the global development cause, which must be taken seriously by humanity.

(People’s Daily Online/Wei Jinsong)  The pandemic has resulted in the relapse of several emerging nations into poverty and instability. Numerous people in developed countries are also living through a hard time due to the pandemic.  “Safety and health are the prerequisite for human development and progress,” Xi said, emphasizing the need of countries supporting each other, better coordinating response measures and improving global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic.  More than 10 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally, but about 83 percent of Africa’s population has yet to receive a single dose. The top priority for countries at the moment is to close the immunization gap.  China has honored its commitment to making Chinese COVID vaccines a global public good and tried to ensure their accessibility and affordability in developing countries, according to Xi. The country has provided over 2.1 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations, and will follow through the pledged donation of 600 million and 150 million doses of vaccines to Africa and ASEAN countries respectively.  The global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted; commodity prices continue to climb; and energy supply remains tight. These risks amplify one another and exacerbate the uncertainties surrounding economic recovery.  The global low inflation environment has notably changed, and the risks of inflation driven by multiple factors are surfacing. If major economies slammed on the brakes or took a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability.  Xi urged countries to increase macro policy coordination, turn to science and technology for more growth drivers, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and prevent serious negative spillovers from policy adjustments in some countries to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development.  In the planet that we call home, humankind shares the same future. Only by staying on top of the dominant trend of economic globalization and adhering to the times' tendency of peace, development and win-win cooperation can human beings jointly surmount difficulties and embrace a brighter future.  True development is development for all and good development is sustainable. The entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the completion and operation of the China-Laos Railway have effectively improved regional “hard connectivity” of infrastructure and “soft connectivity” of rules and standards, demonstrating how win-win cooperation between countries drives development.、    Photo taken on April 17, 2022 shows national flags of various counties fluttering in the wind at the Qionghai Boao Airport in Boao township, south China’s Hainan province, host township of the Boao Forum for Asia. (People’s Daily Online/Meng Zhongde)  China has actively pressed ahead with high-quality Belt and Road cooperation for high-standard, sustainable and people-centered growth, injecting strong impetus into the sustainable development of countries along the routes of the initiative. The GDI proposed by China has been echoed and supported by the United Nations and other international organizations and nearly 100 countries. These are convincing evidence of China’s efforts to promote the global development cause in pursuit of win-win results.  As the Ukraine crisis continues to escalate, geopolitical factors are encumbering global economic recovery and further disrupting the global development cause; developing countries are bearing the brunt of the effects.  China has persisted in promoting peace talks and stressed that all parties should create the necessary environment and conditions for advancing peace talks. This is a decision made by the country not only for world peace and security, but for global development.  “A review of human history teaches us that the more difficult things get, the greater the need grows to stay confident,” Xi pointed out. China will continue to join hands with various countries and create tremendous synergy through win-win cooperation to together overcome various roadblocks along the way, promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development, and push forward the global development cause.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

And yet, NATO has never stopped pursuing its eastward expansion, which eventually led to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The U.S., the backstage manipulator of NATO’s eastward expansion, and which has already raked in huge profits from the conflict, has not only benefited from the conflict, but also has attempted to seek hegemony amid tensions.  Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the stock prices of relevant companies have all dropped, but those of American military companies have meanwhile soared. The stock prices of U.S. military firms Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies Corporation increased by about 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in the most recent nearly one-month period. Gregory J. Hayes, CEO of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, said his company will benefit from the tensions now unfolding around the world.  This is not the first time that the Americans have profited from a war, and the repeated conduct of the U.S. in its raking in profits from wars around the world are just too numerous to count. According to a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on March 14, the overall volume of international transfers of major arms between 2017 and 2021 was lower than that between 2012 and 2016. However, during the same period, the arms exports of the U.S. increased significantly. The U.S. is the world’s largest arms exporter, while crises and wars undoubtedly provide hotbeds for U.S. military companies and American politicians to make a fortune.  In addition to supporting American arms producers, there are other measures that Washington has taken to allow the U.S. to profit from wars. Plundering and controlling the energy markets has always been an important aim of the U.S. government in instigating confrontations and waging wars around the world. The U.S. authorities, while saying that they stand on the side of peace and justice, are actually thinking about how to get more Americans engaged in what is a lucrative business.  The rights and wrongs in the Russia-Ukraine crisis can and will be witnessed by all. The U.S. has exposed its selfishness and hypocrisy by pouring fuel on the fire. Washington is the one that is profiting from the conflict, and the Americans may be the only ones who benefit from the conflict.  While taking advantage of the conflict to rake in huge profits, the U.S. has also reinforced the bloc that it established by ganging up with its Western allies, and has attempted to contain its “imaginary enemies,” thus further exacerbating divisions and confrontations between countries and then taking advantage of these divisions and confrontations to consolidate its global hegemony.  In the meantime, with the U.S. government failing to curb such persistent domestic problems as the country’s political divides, ethnic conflicts, and rising violent crimes, not to mention the rapidly spreading COVID-19 virus and rampant high inflation, a conflict in Europe offers a perfect opportunity that U.S. politicians can make use of in order to serve U.S. domestic political purposes and distract the attention of the American public from domestic contradictions.  However, the whole world is paying a price as the U.S. seeks selfish gains. Led by the U.S., Western countries have imposed all-round and undifferentiated sanctions against Russia, which not only has complicated the situation in the region, but has also struck a heavy blow to the world economy. Affected by a rise in the prices of bulk commodities, many countries and regions, including the Eurozone, are seeing soaring inflation, which is severely straining the livelihoods of the common people residing in these various European countries and regions.  Europe is entering a difficult phase in its history. The region will face, in the short term, higher inflation and slower growth. There is considerable uncertainty about how large these effects will be and how long they will last for, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), pointed out.  For a long time, the U.S. has instigated confrontations and conflicts in countries around the world in an attempt to make a fortune, severely undermining international peace and stability. The tricks of American leaders will sooner or later be seen through for what they are. The U.S., by hyping up threats of wars, aggravating regional conflicts, profiting from tensions in relevant countries, and raking in huge profits from crises at the expense of its allies and even the whole world, is bound to be resisted and opposed by the international community of nations.

(Xinhua/Zhang Nan)  BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- As the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 wrapped up in south China's Hainan Island on Friday, participants are walking away knowing that China remains a stabilizing force for the world at this precarious moment.  The forum was held against the backdrop of recurring COVID-19 outbreaks, rising geopolitical tensions and higher inflation, all of which have spelled more uncertainties for the global economy.  All eyes were on China, whose economic performance and trade policies have far-reaching influences.  Registering a 4.8-percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of this year, China's economy is off to a steady start, a feat accomplished despite the daunting challenges of contracting demand, supply chain shocks and a weak forecast.  The healthy economic output, grown out of a series of pro-growth policies rolled out by Beijing, underscores the resilience of China's economy.  Faced with the challenges of the pandemic, China has executed a dynamic zero-COVID approach, balancing the tasks of protecting its population from the virus with keeping its economy on track.  Meanwhile, China has done its best to support the worldwide cause of fighting the pandemic, and actively promoted foreign trade, which have helped stabilize the global supply chain and alleviated inflation, benefiting China's trade partners.  Last year, China's foreign trade exceeded 6 trillion U.S. dollars for the first time, reaching a new height. In the first quarter of this year, China's total imports and exports of goods grew by 10.7 percent year-on-year. The figures highlight the global dividends of China as the "world factory" and "world market," which are especially valuable given the shadow of hyperinflation.  Furthermore, China's actual use of foreign direct investment (FDI) hit a record high when it expanded 14.9 percent year-on-year to 1.15 trillion yuan (around 177 billion dollars) in 2021. In the first quarter of this year, China's actual use of FDI increased by 25.6 percent year-on-year.  Facing unfavorable external factors including the accelerated pace of the U.S. Federal Reserve's tapering and interest rate hikes and the tightening of global liquidity, China has focused on its own economic realities, relied on its large market advantage and strong foreign exchange reserves, pursued a proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy, maintained a reasonable amount of liquidity, and demonstrated its regulatory strength and policy determination.  On April 15, China's central bank said it had decided to lower the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions by 0.25 percentage point from April 25, enhancing its support for the development of the real economy and for the reduction in comprehensive financing costs.  To offset risks brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China has insisted on peace, and exerted stability on the global supply chain through public goods such as the Belt and Road Initiative.  All these facts have made it abundantly clear that China is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order, and that it has injected and will continue to inject urgently needed certainty into an unpredictable world.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Wang Ying)  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern, said the World Health Organization (WHO) in a recent statement, calling on countries to maintain response measures.  However, some countries have decided to "lie flat" with the "let it rip" approach. For instance, many states of the U.S. have ended mask mandates, relaxed indoor control measures and shut down COVID testing sites. The UK has removed all COVID-19 restrictions and stopped offering free COVID-19 testing for the general public.  Germany cancelled most of its control measures and some other countries, including Switzerland, removed them all. Besides, compliance with control measures in Sweden has always been voluntary rather than mandatory since the outbreak of COVID-19, and the country has never implemented lockdown or shut down enterprises to prevent the spread of the virus.  Is the "let it rip" approach making situations better in these countries?  Not really.  A report written by American public health experts found that the U.S. saw the largest decline in life expectancy over the past two years among the 20 wealthy countries the report studied. And the country was the only one that experienced a drop in life expectancy in both 2020 and 2021, while the rest saw a rebound last year after undergoing a slight decline in 2020.  According to statistics released by the Office for National Statistics of the UK earlier this month, one in 13 people in the country was estimated to have been infected with the virus, nearly 20 times the average prevalence recorded previously.  As a matter of fact, the "let it rip" approach not only imposes health and safety risks against the people in the countries that adopt it, but also impedes global efforts to fight the virus.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently warned that some countries have relaxed public health and social measures and reduced testing, impacting thus the global ability to monitor evolution of the virus.  What's even worse, the instability brought by Western countries' "let it rip" approach is making COVID-19 control much more difficult for developing countries.  Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization noted that vaccination gaps will keep Latin America at risk during future waves. A study suggests that more than two-thirds of all Africans have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, adding that the virus is still spreading and may evolve into more dangerous variants.  Studies show that the mortality during Omicron waves was higher than that when Delta prevailed, though the death rate in the recent days declined. The Omicron variant is still dangerous. It is especially threatening aging groups and patients with serious underlying diseases. Therefore, timely nucleic acid testing, effective control measures and fair vaccination are still what's needed today.  The WHO Emergency Committee for COVID-19 suggested that countries continue to use evidence-informed and risk-based public health and social measures, and be prepared to scale up these measures rapidly in response to changes in the virus and the population immunity.  Recently, the surging infections have already prompted some countries to restart control measures that had been relaxed or canceled. The White House declared to extend the U.S. coronavirus public health emergency on April 13, and Germany reversed course on plans to end mandatory quarantine. Facing the Omicron sublineage BA.2, which is more transmissible and undetectable, countries "lying flat" are just seesawing their response measures.  In front of a pandemic that is unseen in a century and concerns the future of mankind, countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which their shared destiny hinges. Only with science-based and firm control measures can they jointly walk out of the shadows and embrace a bright future.&nbsp; Source: People's Daily ]]></full-text></doc>

Naturally, all anti-epidemic measures come at a price, and there has been short-term downward pressure on the Chinese economy. But it would be shortsighted to believe that this will cripple the growth of the world's second largest economy.  First of all, China has been careful to monitor the duration and scope of all anti-epidemic measures, and the vast majority of its people are still enjoying a normal life, free from the woes of the epidemic.  Moreover, we can be certain that the financial hub of Shanghai will rebound from anti-epidemic measures, and this is also true for the rest of the nation.  China has over two years of experience as well as a track record that speaks for itself in coordinating epidemic prevention and economic development.  Second, with better-than-expected growth in the first quarter, China's economy is off to a steady start this year. It exceeded market expectations with year-over-year growth of 4.8 percent, well above 4 percent in the previous quarter.  In the same period, China's total imports and exports of goods jumped by 10.7 percent year on year, while paid-in foreign direct investment (FDI) soared by 25.6 percent year on year.  This rock-steady start only goes to show that the momentum of China's sustained economic recovery remains unhinged. China continues to draw from its array of strong economic fundamentals such as its industrial supply chains and its colossal consumer market.  Thirdly, China has already rolled out a raft of supportive policies to counter the fallout of the COVID-19 resurgence.  The People's Bank of China, the central bank, announced a 0.25 percentage point cut of the reserve requirement ratio from April 25, injecting 530 billion yuan (about 82 billion U.S. dollars) of liquidity into the market.  The central bank, together with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, this week jointly released 23 measures to help businesses affected by the latest COVID-19 resurgence to improve domestic economic circulation and facilitate exports.  In 2022, the 400 billion yuan inclusive re-lending fund that especially targets micro and small enterprises will continue to be used on a rolling basis, and the quota can be expanded if necessary.  Other supportive policies included setting a quota of 3.65 trillion yuan for local-government-issued special-purpose bonds to fund construction projects, 2.5 trillion yuan worth of tax and fee cuts in 2022, and front-loading the construction of major projects.  And last but not least, China is known for having an extensive policy toolkit it can use to stimulate the economy, such as the deep cash reserve held by commercial banks.  There is still plenty of room to adjust monetary and fiscal policies, including the injection of more liquidity and more tax and fee cuts.  Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun said, in an article published on April 16, that the proactive fiscal policy will be front-loaded and fully implemented.  Policies need to be issued at the earliest possible date with funds allocated in a timely way to generate economic activities and stabilize the economy, Liu said in the article in the Qiushi Journal, a flagship magazine of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.  All in all, any impartial eye can see that China is poised to overcome the challenges that lie ahead, achieve sustained economic growth, and make further contributions to world economic recovery. ■ Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

By weaponizing its global financial supremacy, Washington's financial terrorism is escalating the already highly-charged confrontation and sending shockwaves around the world.  The moment Moscow launched the military operation, Washington rushed to maneuver a ton of sanctions against Moscow, removing Russian banks from the international financial messaging system SWIFT, freezing any Russian assets "touching the U.S. financial system," and threatening to "crush Russia's economy."  Russia and the rest of the world have already felt the repercussions. Following the sanctions, ratings agencies downgraded Russia to "junk" status. The Institute of International Finance predicted a double-digit contraction in Russia's economic growth.  On the global scale, the sanctions fueled sharp hikes of oil and natural gas prices. Sizable increase in the prices of key commodities is triggering accelerated high inflation in many countries and weakening the already faltering global recovery from the pandemic.  It is abundantly clear that the United States, by exploiting the U.S. dollar's global dominance, is converting the international financial system into an international sanctions system.  In the mid 1960s, when fixed exchange rates based on the post-World War II gold standard were gradually replaced by a global system reliant on the dollar as the primary means of cross-border payments and reserves, France's then Finance Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing coined the phrase "exorbitant privilege" to bemoan a United States taking advantage of the dollar dominance for self-interest.  Over the past more than 50 years, the United States has transformed that "exorbitant privilege" into an "exorbitant weapon of mass financial destruction" for geopolitical contention, and pulled the trigger multiple times.  In early of the century, Washington executed the same playbook in its dealing with the Iran nuclear issue, expelling Iranian banks from SWIFT and banning imports of Iranian energy. Even now, the Iranian economy is still struggling in the shadow of Washington's sanctions.  The latest sanctions and threats of more sanctions on Russia are another salient example that Washington is getting increasingly unscrupulous in abusing its dollar hegemony for self-serving purposes. The global community should stay ever more vigilant against Washington's unbounded financial terrorism.  America's messing around is reminding all countries of the dangerous possibility of being cut off from the global financial market at Washington's whim.  "The more we use it, the more other countries are going to diversify due to geopolitical reasons," said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a fellow for international political economy at the Council on Foreign Relations based in the United States.  As a hedge against the risk of falling into the prey of Washington's financial terrorism, de-dollarization is being accepted as a rational option by more.  Since the 2000s exactly when Washington started using the dollar dominance as a menacing tool for geopolitical coercion, the dollar's position as the world's dominant reserve currency has been going downhill.  According to data from the International Monetary Fund, in 2021, the dollar accounted for less than 60 percent international foreign currency reserves, while in 2000, the number is more than 70 percent.  By contrast, currencies of some emerging economies like the Chinese renminbi are gaining a larger share in international foreign currency reserves and transnational transactions.  People with basic economic knowledge know that the value of a currency rests on people's trust in its issuer, typically a country's government. The eroding dollar dominance is a prognostic indicator of the shrinking trust the world holds towards Washington.  The United States does not lack world-class minds to tell that Washington's addiction to dollar weaponization is provoking a backlash: the world's trust in the U.S. dollar and a global financial transaction system underpinned by the dollar is fading away. There is only one way to explain Washington politicians' craziness: they have grown too hubristic to make rational calls.  Like in the game of Jenga, the tower of the dollar dominance is still standing, yet some of its blocks are being taken away. A complete collapse may take some time, yet seems inevitable in the future if Washington continues down the wrong and destructive path.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

This year's event is being held as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage all over the world and the international situation turns increasingly grave, casting a shadow over global economic growth.  Asia led the world in economic recovery in 2021 and remains a powerhouse of global economic growth. The Asian economy will still be in recovery in 2022, but its growth rate could be moderate, according to a BFA report titled "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress."  Looking ahead to 2022, there are still many factors affecting Asia's economic growth, including the pandemic, the geopolitical situation, and the pace and intensity of monetary policy adjustments in some countries including the United States.  Xi noted that the strength to break through the mist and embrace a bright future comes from cooperation, and that the most effective way to do so is through solidarity. Countries should uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and international order underpinned by international law. In particular, major countries should lead by example.  Countries should remain committed to building an open world economy, stay on top of the dominant trend of economic globalization, and increase macro-policy coordination. They should turn to science and technology for more growth drivers, keep the global industrial and supply chains stable, and prevent serious negative spillovers from policy adjustments in certain countries, all in an effort to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development.  Asia should seize the opportunities provided by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the China-Laos railway to foster a more open Asia-wide market and make new strides in mutually beneficial cooperation.  Moreover, great efforts should be made to promote Asian unity. Choosing dialogue and cooperation over zero-sum games, openness and inclusiveness over a closed-door and exclusive approach, and exchanges and mutual learning over a sense of superiority -- these are the only choices worthy of the broad-mindedness of Asians.  Despite increasing headwinds, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, including its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. China will provide great dynamism for the stability and recovery of the world economy and broader market opportunities for all countries.  China will redouble its efforts to achieve high-quality development and expand its high-standard opening-up. It will take solid steps to develop its pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port, align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and move ahead with institutional opening-up.  It will implement the RCEP in full, seek to conclude high-standard Free Trade Agreements with more countries and regions, and actively work toward joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement. The country will also press ahead with high-quality Belt and Road cooperation to make it high-standard, sustainable and people-centered.  China will follow the path of peaceful development unswervingly, and it will always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of international order.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Historically, Europe has considerably contemplated the issue of peace and made active practice in this respect.  For instance, German philosopher Immanuel Kant published the famous essay Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch in 1795, putting forward the idea of achieving perpetual peace for humankind in practical and reasonable manner.  Even during the Cold War, European countries were able to progress in building a common security architecture through dialogues and negotiations, and created and wrote the important principle of “indivisible security” into Helsinki Final Act, Charter of Paris for A New Europe and other agreements.  However, the “Helsinki Spirit” never really put down roots in the European continent. The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has thrown the continent into warfare once again, which proves that the existing security architecture in Europe is seriously flawed.  Although a bipolar system was long gone before the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine conflict, the “post-Cold War order” governing Europe’s security was never rid of the residual effects of the Cold War. Antagonistic contradiction was not removed and the Cold War mentality still prevailed.  The U.S., the self-proclaimed winner in the Cold War that takes Russia as the loser, has roped in European countries to conduct political discrimination and economic “reform” against Russia and squeeze the latter’s security space.  Theoretically, Europe’s security is governed by the “Helsinki Spirit” advocated by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), but what in practice holds a dominant position is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which beats the drum for a security concept full of exclusiveness and confrontation.  NATO has been building up its strength by recruiting new members and expanding under its “new mission”, during which the military alliance and Russia have accumulated escalating conflicts of interest and gradually lost mutual trust. This has made Europe’s security situation seriously imbalanced.  When the Ukraine crisis was emerging and escalating, the U.S. refused to assume its responsibility to carry out direct and equal dialogues with Russia on Europe’s security issue, though there was huge room to solve the problem with diplomatic means.  Instead, the White House directed the NATO to show military deterrence, which squeezed the space for European countries to conduct diplomatic mediation. This led to an illusion that the U.S. and NATO could “provide protection” for Ukraine, and eventually prompted the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  The long-lasting peace in the region needs to be supported by a balanced security architecture, must be maintained by effective mutual trust measures, and requires employing all necessary means to ensure sustainable development.  The security concerns of all relevant parties should be respected, and differences in the size, strength and systems of countries should not become a dividing line separating them from each other.  Arduous journey as it may be to regain security and peace in Europe, countries in the region must take the unshirkable responsibility to build a long-term regional security architecture, as war-induced fear, refugee crisis, economic recession and poverty are even more unbearable.  To restore security and peace in Europe, the European Union needs to give full play to its role as the most important political and economic organization in the region, uniting all forces in the region and even the international community that advocate peace talks and taking all possible measures that help enhance mutual trust rather than heightening hostility to promote Russia and Ukraine to conduct dialogues and negotiations for a ceasefire as early as possible.  Europe has experienced alternate years of war and peace and should be well aware of the truth that “long-lasting peace can only be achieved by transforming enemies to friends.”  The fact is that European countries and Russia have been and will always be neighbors. Therefore, European countries should handle major issues such as expanding sanctions against Russia and increasing military aid to Ukraine in a rational and prudent manner, conduct equal and candid dialogues with Russia on the establishment of a regional security architecture, and seek to reach a consensus with Russia on realizing the common interests of Europe and even Eurasia through economic cooperation, political reconciliation and other means.  More importantly, Europe should make resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict and reshaping future regional security as the most important goal for achieving strategic autonomy, realize its role as the subject in restructuring European security, and urge the U.S. to take responsibility for not escalating the conflict, not evading contradictions with Russia, and not undermining European security.  Only through gradual changes to ideas and long-term capacity building on the basis of conflict resolution can Europe establish an independent strategic position and provide a solid and strong guarantee for a sustainable regional security architecture.  Regional security architecture cannot exclude any country in the region. As the international community generally reaches a consensus about pursuing development and economic globalization has made countries’ destinies more closely intertwined, Europe should, more than ever, endeavor to build a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture to promote long-term peace in Europe and Eurasia.

Unlike her usual transactions, this time she chose to pay in digital yuan, China's digital fiat currency, or the e-CNY.  "I feel it is very convenient as it took me less than one minute to download the application and register an account," said Zhang. "There are also some discounts available now, so I'm willing to try the digital yuan."  Like Zhang, many Chinese people are embracing the digital yuan with a positive attitude. Thanks to the promotion of banking institutions, internet companies, and retail terminals, digital yuan now can be used in a wider range of scenarios.

(Xinhua)  MORE CONVENIENT  China has stepped up efforts to promote the digital yuan with pilot programs. Since 2017, the country has tested the use of the digital yuan in over 10 places from Shenzhen to Shanghai and Xiong'an New Area.  The use of digital yuan is similar to that of WeChat Pay and Alipay, which are popular online payment apps in China. With QR code or Near Field Communication (NFC) techniques, the payment can be completed easily on mobile terminals of both shoppers and merchants. What makes digital yuan different is that it can still be used without a network.  Tourists could pay in digital yuan at ticket windows, merchandise stores and restaurants from April 15, according to Liu Yiying, a finance manager of the management branch under Canton Tower Cultural Tourism Development Co., Ltd.  "We launched preferential activities for digital yuan after the May Day holiday, which has attracted an increasing number of tourists," said Liu.  In the tramline in Guangzhou's Haizhu District, the upgraded checking machines in passenger cars and stations also support digital yuan payment.  Since the digital yuan payment was launched in April, hundreds of payments have been made cumulatively, with nearly 100 orders a day at most, according to Su Jun, deputy general manager of Guangzhou Tram.  "From the perspective of enterprises' financial management, digital yuan improves the efficiency as the money paid by consumers can be transferred to our account in real time," said Su.

(Xinhua/Wu Wei)  MORE INSTITUTIONS COVERED  The pilot version of the digital yuan app was released on major Android app stores and Apple's App Store on Jan 4. Currently, the designated operators of digital yuan cover major Chinese banks, such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank, and online banks.  "We promote discount campaigns for people using the digital yuan in supermarkets such as Guangzhou Grandbuy and Guangzhou Friendship Store, which can effectively stimulate the enthusiasm of consumers," said an official with the Guangzhou branch of ICBC. "The merchants are also free of service charge at the same time."  Many internet platforms that gather rich consumption scenes are also opening up to embrace the digital currency, such as JD.COM, Tencent, Meituan and Bilibili.  By the end of 2021, there were more than 8 million applicable scenarios of digital yuan in the pilot areas via WeChat, a social software developed by Tencent. The company said it has deeply participated in the design, research, development and operation of the digital currency since 2018.  According to data from Meituan, more than 5 million sub-wallets of digital currency were pushed to the Meituan App, and more than 4 million users spent digital yuan on Meituan from last September to early May.  Several banks in south China's metropolis of Shenzhen are to cooperate with Meituan to distribute red packets of digital yuan worth 30 million yuan (about 4.42 million U.S. dollars).  "The pilot project of Meituan is a beneficial attempt to advocate simple, moderate, green and low-carbon life through digital currency," said Cao Heping, a professor at the School of Economics of Peking University.

(Photo by Luo Ling/Xinhua)  MORE CITIES INVOLVED  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced in early April that the pilot program would be expanded to more domestic cities, including Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen and six cities in east China's Zhejiang Province hosting the 19th Asian Games, following its successful operation over the past years.  Beijing and Zhangjiakou were also included in the program after tests in the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.  A number of application modes have taken shape in wholesale and retail, catering, tourism and payment of administrative fees, which cover both online and offline scenarios and can be replicated and promoted. The scale of users, merchants and transactions in the pilot areas has grown steadily.  Guangzhou, as one of the pilot cities, has innovatively implemented new application scenarios such as granting talent subsidies and paying parallel imported cars with digital yuan and promoted the use of digital yuan in various scenarios such as transportation, supermarkets in business circles, tourism and online consumption platforms.  China's digital yuan transactions hit nearly 87.57 billion yuan at the end of 2021, as the country ramped up research and pilot use of the central bank's digital currency.  A total of 261 million personal wallets for the digital yuan had been opened, and the number of pilot scenarios had exceeded 8.08 million, said Zou Lan, an official with the PBOC.  Zou said the central bank would continue promoting research and development of the digital fiat currency and further deepen the pilot use of e-CNY in retail services, government services, and other scenarios.

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  The United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded U.S.-ASEAN summit will not draw regional countries closer to the U.S. side, and the U.S. attempt to court support among ASEAN in pursuit of its geopolitical interests is unlikely to gain traction, experts have said.  U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL  Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.  Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.  "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."  The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."  Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."  Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.  Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.  "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.  As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.  "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.  "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.  From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.  A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."  This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."

(Photo by Sovannara/Xinhua)  ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE  Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.  With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.  The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.  "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."  The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.  Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.  "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.  Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.  "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.  "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.  VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN  It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.  Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.  "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.  Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."  "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances." Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Ninni Andersson/Government Offices of Sweden/Handout via Xinhua)  Finland and Sweden have been members of the European Union since 1993, but until now they have been among a small minority of EU member states not part of the NATO military alliance. Once they join, it will leave only four of the EU's 27 member states Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta -- outside NATO.  ROME, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The likely ascension of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been sparked by fears in those countries of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. But analysts said the development could have consequences that go beyond the current crisis.  Finland and Sweden have been members of the European Union since 1993, but until now they have been among a small minority of EU member states not part of the NATO military alliance. Once they join, it will leave only four of the EU's 27 member states Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta -- outside NATO.  It also means that 24 of NATO's 32 members will be members of the European Union.  Analysts said that the two countries' membership in NATO will strengthen the alliance: both countries are among the world's richest nations, according to World Bank data, and military spending in both countries is broadly in line with NATO averages stated as a percentage of each country's gross domestic product.    Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde (6th L), Minister of Defense Peter Hultqvist (5th L) and other parliamentary party representatives present the result of a security analysis at a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 13, 2022. (Ninni Andersson/Government Offices of Sweden/Handout via Xinhua)  "What this means is that the ties between NATO and the European Union will become even closer," Elena Sciso, an international law professor at Rome's LUISS University, told Xinhua. "Consider that the European Union's Lisbon Treaty from 2009 includes a clause on mutual, collective defense, just as NATO does."  Nicolai von Ondarza, a political scientist and head of the European Union division at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs said Finland and Sweden were never "entirely neutral" when it came to security issues, noting their armed forces already coordinated activities with those from NATO countries and they shared intelligence. Instead, they practiced what he called "armed neutrality" -- meaning they are willing to use military force to maintain their neutrality if needed.  "One of the things this will mean is that the Baltic Sea will now become largely a NATO Sea," von Ondarza said in an interview, referring to the body of water in northern Europe surrounded by Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany -- all NATO member states -- in addition to Finland, Sweden, and Russia.  "I also think we will see a policy shift when it comes to foreign and military policy that will shift from crisis management to territorial defense," he said.  According to LUISS University's Sciso, there could be impacts of the move far beyond Europe. She noted that the Arctic Sea -- a nearly unpopulated region without major land mass thought to contain 160 billion barrels of oil and as much as 30 percent of the planet's natural gas is currently administered by eight countries that border it, five of which are members of NATO: Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United States. Once Finland and Sweden join NATO, that number will be seven of eight, with only Russia outside the alliance.  "It's significant because the states that govern the area will be dominated by NATO," Sciso said. "The countries involved are obligated to respect rules agreed to for the region on things ranging from fishing rights to nuclear testing, but they remain sovereign states and two of them are the world's largest nuclear powers."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

U.S. President Joe Biden defended his response to the crisis Friday as Republicans and conservative media attacked his administration's actions.  "If we'd been better mind readers I guess we could have (reacted faster)," he told CNN at a press conference.  Across the country, mothers took to social media and drove up to 50 miles to look around amid baby food formula shortage, People, an American weekly magazine that specializes in celebrity news and human-interest stories, said Friday, calling the situation "very, very scary."  One mother also told the Denver Channel that "my entire family just goes and finds the formula when we they can."  "My sister picked me up some in Arvada yesterday, my dad up in Thornton the other day," Ashlee Lane, the mother of a 7-month-old, said of her family's efforts scouring the Denver area for baby formula.  Data released this week by Datasembly, which tracks baby formula stock at more than 11,000 stores, showed that 43 percent of the top-selling baby formula products were out of stock as of the week ending May 8, and in five states, more than half of the top-selling formula products were missing from stores.  At busy retail giant Target in Boulder, 50 km northwest of Denver, baby formula supplies were scarce and most store shelves were empty on Friday.  "Usually they tell us when more is coming in," a store inventory clerk told Xinhua, pointing to her hand-held computer. "But this says zero are coming in and zero are expected soon."  Nearby, at high-end grocer Whole Foods, the story was the same, even with non-traditional formula products that catered to mothers with money seeking organic baby food solutions.  "We really noticed it in the past week," customer service representative Julian Bell said, "although our stock has been dwindling for several weeks."  On Friday, the Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS) website posted that "manufacturers have ramped up production 30-50 percent," and that "yesterday, President Biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including Walmart, Target, Reckitt, and Gerber, to discuss ways to get more formula quickly and safely onto store shelves."  HHS pointed to the January recall of "certain powdered infant formulas" by industry leader Abbott Nutrition as a catalyst for the shortages, a federal response to four Michigan babies getting sick from the formula and two infant deaths between September and February.  "The reason we're here is because the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) took the steps to ensure that babies were taking safe formula," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a press conference Thursday.  "There were babies who died from taking this formula, so they were doing their jobs," Psaki said.  Psaki announced a series of measures to alleviate the shortage, including efforts to speed up production and crack down on price gouging, as reports surfaced of individuals buying out store supplies and re-selling them on Ebay for huge profits.  The Justice Department is now working with state attorney generals to monitor price-gouging in the formula market, and Biden said Thursday he had asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate reports of price-gouging.  The Biden administration is also working to increase imports of formula, a new solution as the United States produces 98 percent of its formula supply, according to an administration fact sheet.  On Friday, Biden also called for cutting red tape on the types of formula parents can buy, calling on the FTC and state attorneys general to crack down on price gouging and unfair market practices, and increase the supply of formula through increased imports.  Congressional Democrats joined the president in demanding answers from baby formula manufacturers.  In letters to the heads of four baby formula companies, Democratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney of New York and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois demanded documents and details about the shortage.  "The national formula shortage poses a threat to the health and economic security of infants and families in communities throughout the country -- particularly those with less income who have historically experienced health inequities, including food insecurity," they wrote in letters sent to Mead Johnson Nutrition, Nestle USA, Perrigo Company and Abbott Nutrition.  These companies control nearly 90 percent of the U.S. market for baby formula, the lawmakers said, requesting certain documents submitted by June 2.  REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT THE CRISIS  Republican leaders were quick to exploit the baby food crisis for their own political gain, slamming Biden on several fronts.  "This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE in America," Elise Stefanik, a New York House Republican, wrote on Twitter. "Sadly, this has become the norm because of Joe Biden's radical agenda."  "Unsurprisingly, when I reached out in February from my office to the FDA we received no substantive response. Joe Biden simply has no plan," Stefanik told the media at a press conference Thursday.  "Instead, bare shelves. Biden has continued to pass the buck. This is not a Third World country. This should never happen in the United States of America. We're unified in demanding action to address this crisis," she added.  Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, joined in: "This is sadly Joe Biden's America."  "Working families are already struggling to put food on the table due to the skyrocketing costs of every day items, and now they are facing a crisis that is threatening the very lives of their newborn children," Wagner said.

The viral disease, which gets its name "tomato fever" because of the red blister it causes, has raised concern in Kerala and the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.  Doctors say tomato flu comes with red rashes, skin irritation, and dehydration.  The illness that experts say is contagious can also cause tiredness, joint pain, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, high fever, or body ache. In some cases, it may also change the skin color of legs and hands, according to reports.  In Kerala, the disease has been detected in children under five years of age.  Tamil Nadu's Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan on Friday urged the local residents not to panic as health authorities were monitoring the situation across the state.  The Karnataka state government has sounded high alert in the districts bordering Kerala.  Health officials in these districts have been directed to step up surveillance measures and maintain a constant vigilance on outpatient services at both private and public health institutions.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"The Organizing Committee hereby expresses sincere gratitude to the AFC, all host cities and the whole society for their great support during the tournament's preparations," the statement added.  The AFC said in a separate statement that it appreciates that China, the CFA and the Local Organizing Committee have made "this very difficult but necessary decision in the collective interests of the AFC Asian Cup 2023, which has also provided the AFC the required time to assess the situation regarding the hosting of the AFC Asian Cup 2023."  "The AFC worked closely with the CFA and the AFC Asian Cup China 2023 Local Organizing Committee during the preparations and several milestones were achieved, including the launch of the tournament logo and the unveiling of the newly completed Shanghai Pudong Football Stadium last year," the Asian football governing body added.  Details about the next steps related to the hosting of the Asian Cup will be announced in due course, the AFC said.  China was awarded the hosting right of the 2023 Asian Cup in June 2019. The 24-team competition was scheduled to be hosted across 10 Chinese cities. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The displaced and most vulnerable families identified by surveys in Shibar and Yakawlang districts of the province received 400 U.S. dollars each in cash assistance on Wednesday, the ministry said in a statement.  The assistance was provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), according to the statement.  It added that more humanitarian assistance would be provided to needy families in Afghanistan's far-flung provinces in the coming days or weeks.  Following the U.S. forces' pullout from Afghanistan last August, Washington has imposed sanctions on the Taliban-run administration and frozen assets of more than 9 billion U.S. dollars of Afghanistan's central bank in a move weighing heavily on the battered economy in the war-torn Asian country.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Although India's first singles Lakshya Sen could not challenge world No. 1 Viktor Axelsen, his team took a 2-1 lead after three matches.  As the semifinal entered the deciding match after Denmark tied the score in the second doubles, India's remarkable run at the tournament seemed to come to an end when H.S. Prannoy twisted his ankle early in the first set. But he bounced back to win the match 13-21, 21-9, 21-12 against Rasmus Gemke.  In the other semifinal, Indonesia cruised into the final again after Anthony Sinisuka Ginting, as well as Mohammad Ahsan/Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, secured a 2-0 lead before Japan put up a tough fight to force a tie. In the third singles match, Shesar Hiren Rhustavito fended off Kodai Naraoka to take the victory for Indonesia. Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

[Photo/Xinhua]  Shanghai is expected to achieve zero-COVID beyond areas under closed-loop management in mid-May, and will by then ease COVID-19 restrictions while implementing a tiered management system for communities based on their risk levels, local authorities said on Friday.  According to Shanghai's Vice-Mayor Wu Qing, efforts to control the current COVID-19 wave have started to show good results. Despite small fluctuations in daily new infection numbers, over 99 percent of new infections have been identified through testing in closed-loop management zones. In the past three days, only six cases were found in other areas.  "The city now faces a critical transition from epidemic emergency response to a normalized prevention and control mode," Wu said.  Further efforts will be made in epidemic control and prevention in key areas, including old neighborhoods and villages at risk of a resurgence, he added.  "We're drafting an outline to consolidate the results of the prevention and control efforts so far and to prepare for the resumption of work, business and on-campus education and a return to normalcy," Wu said.  Cars will be allowed back on the roads gradually while supermarkets, convenience stores and other types of businesses such as hairdressing will gradually be allowed to operate.  "Students who need to sit exams, especially ninth, 11th and 12th graders in high schools, will be given priority to return to school. More healthcare institutions and government service windows will also be reopened gradually," he added.  Over 9,900 nucleic acid testing sites have been set up and more than 5,700 of them were operational across the city as of Thursday, mainly providing services for residents in precautionary zones and people who have resumed work, Wu said.  Shanghai reported 227 new locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases, 1,869 asymptomatic infections and two deaths on Thursday. The two who died were aged 88 and 89.  "Given the large aging population that is vulnerable to the virus, vaccination acts as one of the most effective means to protect the elderly and we must promptly accelerate the vaccination of this group of people," said Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission.  Shanghai administered around 100,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines between May 1 and 11, with about half of these given to people aged 60 and above, according to Zhao.

Following an apparently random yet violent murder of a young Korean-American woman in a Chinatown apartment here in February, mourners placed flowers, candles, photos, and cardboard signs condemning anti-Asian hatred around a tree outside the residential building where Christina Yuna Lee was stabbed to death.  While the shock of Lee's death had yet to wear off, mourners were outraged that the makeshift memorial for Lee had been repeatedly vandalized.  The temporary memorial was first vandalized in the middle of the night just three days after Lee's death, and it continued to be vandalized even in broad daylight.  "So five times last month, and it just keeps increasing. It is very sad," Brian Chin, Lee's former landlord, told Xinhua.  According to video clips from a surveillance camera shared by Chin, a man kicked at the flowers, candles, and signs in the early morning on March 2, and another pedestrian pulled down a cardboard sign about a week later.  Every attack on the memorial is pretty much anti-Asian and "it is very scary right now," said Chin, whose family came to the United States from China over 60 years ago.  "They're doing it with hate. They see her picture. They see the flowers and candles," Chin added.  Lee's tragic death followed the fatal shoving of Asian American Michelle Alyssa Go onto subway tracks by a man at Times Square station on Jan. 15 and the death of Yaopan Ma in January in a racially motivated attack in East Harlem.  "Her (Lee's) death is part of an alarming pattern of unchecked, hateful violence against women, namely women of Asian descent and women of color that can no longer stand without consequence," said one of Lee's relatives in an appeal on Gofundme.com.  For Chin, a middle-aged man, the continued anti-Asian hate crimes had brought about unprecedented depression.  "I think everyone is terrified right now that they will be attacked on the subways, on the streets, and then the guy will be out on the same day," he said.  According to Chin, this wave of anti-Asian hatred began with very vitriolic language which claims COVID-19 as the so-called "Chinese flu" or "Wuhan flu."  Kathleen Flynn-hui, whose husband originally came from Hong Kong, said that anti-Asian prejudice affects her family on a daily basis.  "We've kind of always felt it, but not as strongly as now," said Flynn-hui, adding that she "dealt with discrimination against my husband because he was Asian the whole time."  Chin said the situation is deteriorating due to a combination of politics, the impact of new laws, and the new Manhattan District Attorney's lenient stance on crime.  "The cops are doing their job, but they arrest them, and they're free the next day due to the laws," said Chin.  Right now, much stronger laws are needed to protect the Asian community, Chin said, calling on lawmakers, the city council, and the mayor to take stronger and more enforceable action.  The Committee of 100, a non-profit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans, recently called on U.S. elected officials, law enforcement, and responsible media to address racism, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders immediately with actionable and concrete results.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

According to the latest edition of Newspoll published on Friday night, the Labor Party holds a comfortable 54-46 lead over the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis.  It marks the 20th consecutive Newspoll where the Coalition has trailed the Labor since November 2020.  Significantly, the Coalition has not been able to make any inroads since Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the election on April 10.  Newspoll found that 43 percent of voters identified Morrison as their preferred prime minister and 42 percent as Labor leader Anthony Albanese.  It represents a major swing in Albanese's favor from a 46-37 lead for Morrison at the end of April.  In a major shift of tone, Morrison promised to change his leadership style if re-elected.  Admitting he can be "a bit of a bulldozer", Morrison promised to empathize more with Australians if given another term as the prime minister.  "I will seek to explain motives and my concerns and empathize a lot more. But I tell you what, at the end of the day, what matters most is I get the job done," he told reporters.  In response, Albanese, who on Saturday announced a Labor government would boost health spending by 970 million Australian dollars (673 million U.S. dollars), promised to unite the country.  "A bulldozer wrecks things. A bulldozer knocks things over. I'm a builder, that's what I am," he said. "I will build things in this country."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at the White House during a summit held on Thursday and Friday, a move widely seen as an attempt by the world's sole superpower to pull members of the bloc into its camp against a rising China.  U.S. ATTEMPTS SHALL FAIL  Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S.-initiated summit was widely viewed as a signal to highlight the importance of what America calls the "Indo-Pacific" region out of strategic concerns, and to counter the rising influence of China in the region.  Lee Pei May, a political expert at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said while the summit occurred amid the tougher Russia-Ukraine conflict, the primary concern of the Biden administration is not about Russia, but more about ensuring a so-called "free and open" Indo-Pacific.  "For the Biden administration to advance this vision, they have to get ASEAN countries on the American side and potentially for the U.S. to play a role in managing the disputes in the South China Sea," she said. "Such moves can be interpreted as challenging China's position in the region and hindering peaceful progress between China and ASEAN countries."  The summit's significance lies in its timing, reported Foreign Affairs magazine on Wednesday. "It is being held as war rages in Ukraine, demonstrating that the United States has not lost its focus on the Indo-Pacific," the report said, adding "U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to better position his country in the wider geopolitical competition with China."  Yet, the United States "shall fail in attempts to counter China, because most ASEAN countries want to expand economic exchanges and other cooperation with (their) regional neighbor China," Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist for the English daily The Philippine Star, told Xinhua.  Flores noted that Washington was also aimed at convincing ASEAN countries to take tougher public positions and join its sanctions against Russia, which, likewise, shall fail. "Most of ASEAN seek to promote dialogue, diplomacy and stability in crisis areas due to ASEAN's traditional position of non-interference and upholding consensus."  Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said that the United States should not use the summit to coerce and pressure ASEAN into submitting to its will and approach against Russia and China.  Commenting on the Western sanctions and illegal embargoes on Russia, Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said these sanctions will harm the global economy.  "I think the rise in fuel prices will not slow down if the Ukraine crisis still continues and the U.S. still push this war forward," Sereyvath added.  As the United States is scrambling to combat a sluggish economy and simmering social disorder amid COVID-19, its capability to fulfill promises to other countries has come under question.  "The U.S. now has limited capacities to deliver on its promises, due to its own political and economic challenges, especially with the upcoming midterm elections in November," Flores cautioned.  "The U.S. can still lobby to export its weapons to ASEAN. It can still attempt (to carry out) political or diplomatic initiatives. It can also attempt to pursue security alliances. But its waning economic activities and influence in Asia will weaken its strategic presence and leverage," the columnist noted.  From the "Pivot to Asia" to the "Indo-Pacific Strategy," the United States has been teaming up its allies and regional countries to contain China. Washington never stops hyping up the concept of "Indo-Pacific" to peddle the targeted strategy at economic, political and military levels.  A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."  This viewpoint was echoed by Veronika Saraswati, researcher at Indonesia's the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is not hard to see that although the United States wants to strengthen its influence in ASEAN, it has not built cooperation with ASEAN countries in a more concrete level, only symbolic."  ASEAN NATIONS WON'T TAKE SIDE  Many believe that ASEAN members, now with a primary focus on post-pandemic economic recovery, will maintain neutrality at the forefront and neglect the attempts to pressure them into a U.S. sphere of influence.  With China rising "sharply out of expectation," the United States "is afraid of losing its control" in Southeast Asia and found it necessary to hold tighter their hegemonic power, Saraswati pointed out.  The Indonesian researcher stressed that Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, certainly do not want to be dragged into the competition between major powers.  "Powerful countries should never use coercive measures to force other countries to choose side," she noted. "For a long time, the exercise of hegemonic power by the U.S. and its allies has had a deep impact on the survival and development of many countries."  The United States will find itself unable to make any headway among ASEAN members, especially after Malaysia and Indonesia voiced concerns over the AUKUS trilateral security partnership involving Australia and Britain, said Azmi Hassan, a senior research fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.  Hassan gave the persuasive example that the United States has been unable to exert pressure on ASEAN over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with most of the 10-member bloc abstaining from voting in favor of a resolution to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council last month.  "Bringing up controversial issues, forcing and coercing ASEAN member states to support its approach and agenda in the region, and trying to divide ASEAN on any issues will undermine the credibility and authenticity of the whole summit. The U.S. should be mindful of it," Matthews told Xinhua.  Rather than pressing the bloc to follow its scenarios or agendas against other countries, Washington should use the meeting to express support for ASEAN's post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery, Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.  "What the U.S. should do is encouraging ASEAN to adhere to its principle of centrality, solidarity and unity," he said, adding the United States should also respect ASEAN's rights in making decisions and refrain from using economic, political or security pressure to bargain with ASEAN or to force ASEAN to make decisions in its favor.  "The U.S. must respect the common interests of the ASEAN, the region and the world, and should not put forward any scenarios or agendas that lead to ASEAN's rift and instability in the region," he said.  VIGILANCE, UNITY URGED IN ASEAN  It is essential for the 10-member bloc to stand in solidarity against the U.S. interference for the sake of regional peace, stability, development and prosperity, Phea said.  Matthews also urged ASEAN leaders to be vigilant about the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, and the Australia-U.K.-U.S. pact, saying both military-cum-security alliances are posing a major security threat to ASEAN and the whole Asia region.  "These alliances will trigger a conventional and nuclear arms race in the region, and thus destabilize peace and security, undermine economic development and destroy the ASEAN's centrality," he said.  Unless it can demonstrate unity, ASEAN may find itself in a position where different members pursue different paths, which could compromise its cohesiveness, Lee cautioned. "This can be remedied by member states forging a consensus when dealing with the United States."  "Having a consensus on key issues is not easy, but it is crucial as it would allow the members to speak with one united voice at the summit," the Malaysian expert noted. "The members can send a signal to the U.S. that ASEAN would remain neutral in whatever circumstances."&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The seven are among a group of 13 people who visited the famous Chinese mountain area, a renowned tourist spot, without permission, bypassing a guarded checkpoint.  The search operation for the remaining six continues.  Cangshan Mountain Reserve in Yangbi Yi Autonomous County has been under closed-off management since March 29, 2020, due to safety work and anti-epidemic prevention.  Local conservation authorities said they received tips from the public about the unauthorized trip on Thursday afternoon.  Ten other people in the group were found on Friday morning and removed from the area.    Rescuers search for missing people on Cangshan Mountain in Dali in southwest China's Yunnan Province, May 14, 2022. /CMG  Rescuers at the site told CMG on Saturday that the missing group consists of six guides, five non-locals, and two members of China's Blue Sky Rescue Team, the country's largest non-governmental humanitarian organization.  Some of them have extensive wilderness survival experience and were equipped with professional hiking sets, including two satellite phones, as well as food and water.  But steep slopes, dense forests and rain are hampering the search.  Authorities said they're trying to find out the reason for the trip, but The Paper, a Chinese media outlet, reported that the visitors were attempting to locate the crash site of a plane that went down on a Hump Route mission in the early 1940s.&nbsp; Source: CGTN ]]></full-text></doc>

This is the third consecutive month of decline for the gauge, which is lower than that of the same period last year, said the China Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.  Halted production due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, coupled with industry chain disruptions and high commodity prices, has made it more difficult for some companies to cover costs, said the association.  The sub-indexes for industry, construction, transportation and postal services, wholesale and retail, as well as hospitality and catering retreated from a month ago, while that for real estate increased.  The industry group calls for targeted support to virus-hit small businesses in the service sector, implementation of policies like tax and fee cuts, as well as efforts to keep prices and employment stable.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"To influence domestic policies in recipient countries ... the U.S. has provided assistance to serve its goals and achieve its interests," Ayman Okeil, general manager of the Cairo-based Maat for Peace, Development, and Human Rights, told Xinhua in a recent interview.  THE NED AS A PROXY  Among all the proxies Washington uses to serve its political agenda in other countries, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was founded in 1983 as a bipartisan, non-profit institution by the U.S. government, is one of the most active.  Nominally a non-governmental organization that provides support for democracy abroad, the NED in fact relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the U.S. Congress, and takes orders from the U.S. government.  Okeil described the NED as one of Washington's "soldiers" for interfering in other countries' decision-making process.  The NED has worked as a substitute for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in cultivating pro-U.S. opposition activists for subverting lawful governments and provoking uprisings in the Arab countries under the pretext of promoting democracy, he said.  According to Saeb Rawashdeh, a political analyst at the Jordan Press Foundation, the NED was founded as a tool for projecting political influence in different sovereign states that the U.S. government has labeled as "non-democratic, totalitarian, authoritarian and anti-American."  The NED supported opposition groups in other countries, which were trained to represent Washington's interest, rather than the vital interests of their own nations and states, Rawashdeh pointed out.  Echoing Rawashdeh's point, Okeil said that the NED has spent millions of U.S. dollars to support political parties, labor unions, dissident movements, and media in dozens of countries.  The organization has been employed as the "mastermind" behind separatist riots, color revolutions, and political crises around the world, with the aim of toppling legitimate governments and creating U.S. puppets in targeted countries, said Ahmad Ashqar, a Syrian journalist and political expert.  The NED makes sure that nations across the globe do what the United States wants them to do and in no way feel confident and capable of pursuing their own political/ideological agendas, Rawashdeh said. "And this is also what the U.S. foreign policy is doing for decades."  A NEW TYPE OF IMPERIALISM  The United States, unfortunately, has created a new type of imperialism, by occupying foreign countries with money and forces and interfering in their choice of leaders and party compositions, Okeil told Xinhua.  Unlike the funds that came from some countries like China, which help improve health, education and development sectors, the U.S. economic aid is always with conditions attached, he noted  Okeil's words are not groundless. According to a study by the American University in Cairo in November 2021, the NED has allocated more than 606 million dollars in "democracy assistance" to Egypt in the period between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the U.S. government provided 415 million dollars in economic assistance to Egypt, which includes 55 million dollars to support programs for promoting democracy.  However, as Tariq Fahmy, a political science professor at the Cairo University, noted, the U.S. mode of democracy has not been successful in the Middle East, and it contradicts many countries' unique conditions.  "We all saw the disgraceful role in provoking the Arab Spring via funding the protesters" under the cover of democracy and human rights, Fahmy said, explaining that such kind of imposed democracy couldn't breed stability.  After the Arab Spring, many people in the Middle East have started to see the real objectives behind the U.S. aid when knowing that Washington had a role in inciting the Arab Spring uprisings via supporting, training and funding young protesters, Okeil noted.  The U.S. model of democracy is not suitable for the world, and based on that model, the U.S. policies led to real crimes, Fahmy said.  It's a fact that the United States has distorted the positive meaning of democracy and emptied such a notion of anything useful and beneficial for other countries, Ashqar argued.  "We have seen several examples like in Syria, where the United States used democracy as a pretext to support separatist forces and radical ones to destabilize the legitimate government," he said. "The U.S. presence in Syria has achieved all but the so-called democracy."  "Under the pretext of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy, the U.S. has stolen key areas in Syria rich with oil and gas, do you call that democracy?" asked the Syrian journalist.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The fire broke out inside the building on Friday evening at 4:40 p.m. (local time) near the city's Mundka metro station, and the death toll became clear only by night.  Reports said the fire started from the first floor of the building at an office of a CCTV cameras and router manufacturing company.  Officials said the firefighting and rescue operations continued until early morning on Saturday. Police are yet to identify the deceased, and the injured have been admitted to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital.  Firefighters used heavy cranes to reach the top floor of the building, and 27 fire tenders were sent to contain the blaze when smoke surrounded the entire building.  Video clips showed people trying to escape the building using a rope and hanging from broken windows. Many people could be seen trying to jump to another building.  "There was only one staircase and because of that people could not go out. I think the building did not have a proper no objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department," Satpal Bhardwaj, divisional officer of the Delhi fire department told media.  Police said they have arrested the owners of the company, but the owner of the building who did not have safety clearance from the fire department is on the run.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed grief over the deaths in the fire.  "Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a tragic fire in Delhi. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery," Modi wrote on social media.  Chances of fire in Indian buildings are usually high as people often ignore safety standards vis-a-vis fire.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

"Different countries and civilizations may prosper together on the basis of respect for each other, and seek common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences," he added.  Xi's remarks elaborated on "Xiconomics," or the economics philosophy of the Chinese president, demonstrating China's commitment to building a harmonious world, promoting common development and enhancing the common interests of mankind.  OPENING WIDER  "We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges," Xi said in his special address, giving insight into a world battered by both the COVID-19 pandemic and sluggish economic growth.  In the past two years, under the guidance of Xi's economic thought, China has struck a fine balance between pandemic control and economic development.  In 2020, China has emerged as the only major economy with positive growth. In 2021, its gross domestic product saw a year-on-year increase of 8.1 percent, contributing around a quarter to world economic growth and beating most market expectations. The country has also played a crucial and irreplaceable role in supporting the global supply chains.  Alexander Petrov, a professor at St. Petersburg State University, said China's success has proved that in a socialist market economy, it is possible to coordinate the efficiency of economic development and social governance, which is needed for global economic recovery in the post-pandemic era.  China has once again become one "driving force of the global economy," said Jochen Goller, president and CEO of BMW China, who spoke highly of China's concerted efforts and strong resilience in both successfully fighting against COVID-19 and boosting economic recovery.  China's steady growth has served as a stabilizer for the world economy amid the pandemic. It has been implementing a development philosophy featuring openness and cooperation, which helped strengthen global solidarity for economic recovery.  "Countries around the world should uphold true multilateralism. We should remove barriers, not erect walls. We should open up, not close off. We should seek integration, not decoupling. This is the way to build an open world economy," Xi said, urging countries worldwide to "make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, and to fully unleash the vitality of the world economy."  Humphrey Moshi, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam of Tanzania, said that "China has been on the front line of encouraging multilateralism among global countries, and it has been doing that through cooperation on the principles of a win-win situation."  "As a staunch supporter of globalization, China has been actively participating in and promoting international cooperation against COVID-19, providing medical equipment and COVID-19 vaccines to many countries," Moshi said.  "China stands ready to work with all countries to build an open world economy so that the spring breeze of openness will bring warmth to all parts of the world," Xi said at the opening ceremony of the fourth China International Import Expo in November 2021, reiterating China's resolve to open wider and with a high standard.  From shortening the negative list for foreign investment and improving the business environment to expanding institutional opening-up, China has honored its commitments by offering more opportunities to other countries, which injected fresh momentum into global economic recovery.  Honson To, chairman of KPMG China and Asia Pacific, said China has kept opening wider to the world, upheld and acted on multilateralism, as well as actively pushed for a more inclusive global cooperation, sending a positive signal that China is willing to work together with other countries for a better future.  BENEFIT FOR ALL  At a time when the international community is struggling to reduce the development gap and secure equal opportunities for all, China has offered its solution to the problem by underlining the people's desire for a happy life.  "No matter what difficulties may come our way, we must adhere to a people-centered philosophy of development, place development and livelihoods front and center in global macro-policies, realize the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build greater synergy among existing mechanisms of development cooperation to promote balanced development worldwide," Xi said at January's forum.  In the eyes of Raphael Tuju, secretary-general of Kenya's ruling Jubilee Party, this people-centered philosophy of development Xi emphasized is well manifested in the Chinese president's famous remarks that "for the good of my people, I will put aside my own well-being."  By the end of 2020, China had lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line and met the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.  Its own people's well-being is not the only thing China cares about. As Xi noted, "on the road to the well-being of all mankind, no country or nation should be left behind."  From China's growth to inclusive and common development of countries worldwide, Xi's economic thought addresses the need of the development of mankind through a variety of cooperation frameworks, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  The Mombasa-Nairobi Railway is a mega project under the BRI. It boosted Kenya's economy by significantly improving freight transportation, brought substantial benefits to local people, and at the same time protected the local ecological environment.  This is the beginning of the transformation, which will create jobs, hope, opportunities and prosperity for all Kenyans, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said during a test ride of the railway.  Another landmark project of Belt and Road cooperation is the 1,035-km China-Laos Railway, which has opened the landlocked country in Southeast Asia and connected it to markets as far away as in Europe since the railway's operation on Dec. 3, 2021.  Sommad Pholsena, vice president of the National Assembly of Laos, said while China was not the first country to express a willingness to build a railway in Laos, it was the only one to turn it into reality.  Xi's proposal to enhance interconnectivity and promote common development provides an opportunity for cooperation among developing countries, Pholsena said.  According to the World Bank, BRI transport projects could, by 2030, help lift 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million people out of moderate poverty globally.  "The more we study the BRI and witness its continuous advancement, the more we can appreciate the vision and the wisdom of President Xi's economic thought on world development," said former Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf.  DEVELOPMENT FOR GOOD  To tackle global challenges and seek sustainable development, the Chinese president has been promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.  Mankind was presented with two choices -- one is vicious competition or even armed conflict for power and self-interest, which may well lead to a disastrous crisis, Xi said when addressing the CPC (the Communist Party of China) in Dialogue with the World Political Parties High-Level Meeting in 2017.  "The other is for us to go along with the tide of the times and rise to challenges through global collaboration," he said. "This, in turn, will create favorable conditions for building a community with a shared future for mankind."  For Khalid Taimur Akram, executive director of the Center for Global and Strategic Studies in Islamabad, the notion of building a community with a shared future for mankind bears significance for today's global development.  China has provided a platform for all to turn this vision into reality, as the international community is searching for ways to advance cooperation and resolve differences, Akram said.  In his speech in September 2021 at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly via video, Xi said "we must revitalize the economy and pursue more robust, greener and more balanced global development. Development holds the key to people's well-being."  He then urged countries around the world to "work together to steer global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth," and proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) to this end.  Speaking highly of the GDI, Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Liberata Mulamula said the pandemic serves as a reminder that the world is a community and no country should be left behind.  Since Xi brought up the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind in 2013, China has been enriching it to reflect the hope of people from all countries for a better world.  "We should follow the trend of history, work for a stable international order, advocate common values of humanity, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We should choose dialogue over confrontation, inclusiveness over exclusion, and stand against all forms of unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony or power politics," Xi said at the WEF meeting in January.  The notion of a community with a shared future is the right path for human development, which could help reduce global inequality, said Ronnie Lins, director of the China-Brazil Center for Research and Business.  The Chinese president's philosophy is of profound theoretical significance, said Maxim Rybachuk, leading researcher at the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  "We are talking about development concepts such as inclusive growth and dual circulation that have benefited both the Chinese people and people in other countries," Rybachuk said.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Xinhua/Zhang Ling)  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's top political advisory body convened a biweekly consultation session on Friday at which attendees contributed their suggestions on further improving capacity building for those who love the country, and love Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions (SARs).  The session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was presided over by Wang Yang, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.  Highlighting the necessity and urgency of enhancing capacity building for the ranks of patriots who love the country, Hong Kong and Macao, Wang underscored the importance of adhering to the fundamental principles of "patriots administering Hong Kong" and "patriots administering Macao."  He urged efforts to unite the patriots and help them improve capabilities including enhancing political consciousness, forging close ties with the people and solving problems, so as to contribute to the realization of good governance in the SARs and ensuring the steady practice of "one country, two systems."  Ten political advisors and an invited representative spoke at the session, while over 90 political advisors voiced their opinions via an online platform.  They extended congratulations on John Lee's election as the six-term chief executive designate of the Hong Kong SAR with an overwhelming majority of votes and expressed confidence in Hong Kong's harmony, stability, prosperity and development.  The political advisors noted that, since the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, those who love the country, and love Hong Kong and Macao have done a lot of work and played an important role, and have withstood tests and shouldered responsibilities.  The political advisors suggested that high priority should be given to enhancing political integrity and capability in governance among the governing teams of the SARs.  For those in political and social organizations in the SARs who love the country and love Hong Kong and Macao, the political advisors suggested that efforts should be made to further strengthen their political stand, promote self-reform and strengthen internal management.  The political advisors also suggested attaching importance to uniting those from professional sectors, expanding the reserve force of those who love the country, and love Hong Kong and Macao, improving the composition of CPPCC members from the SARs, and strengthening patriotic education for young people in the SARs.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Najib Balala, the cabinet secretary of the Ministry for Tourism and Wildlife, told journalists in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, that trial runs by motorists are expected to commence on the facility from Saturday.  "The future is bright for the tourism sector because the Nairobi expressway is expected to reduce travel time from the airport to various tourism destinations across the city," Balala said Thursday evening during the fifth-anniversary celebration of Park Inn Hotel, Nairobi.  He observed that tourists have been facing delays in moving between the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Nairobi's central business district.  "With the expressway, tourists will take about ten minutes from arrival at the airport to the city center, instead of taking more than two hours currently," he added.  The 27.1-km Nairobi Expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model and consists of four-lane and six-lane dual carriageways.  The Kenyan official said the Nairobi expressway will ensure tourists can enjoy the city's beautiful scenery due to seamless connectivity. "We want tourists to enjoy a seamless travel experience from their arrival so as to enhance their tourism experience in Kenya."  According to the Ministry for Tourism and Wildlife, the Nairobi expressway will also attract more international hotel brands to set up operations in Kenya's capital city as the level of traffic congestion reduces.  A trial run of the expressway will be launched Saturday.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The West Texas Intermediate for June delivery added 4.36 U.S. dollars, or 4.1 percent, to settle at 110.49 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude for July delivery increased 4.1 dollars, or 3.8 percent, to close at 111.55 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange.  The rally came despite data released Friday by Houston-based oilfield services company Baker Hughes showing that the number of total active drilling rigs in the United States rose by nine to 714 this week.  Oil rigs in the United States rose by six to 563 this week , gas rigs rose by three to 149, and miscellaneous rigs stayed unchanged at two, showed the data.  Concerns over supply risks lingered as the European Union (EU) worked on gaining support for an oil embargo against Russia.  Last week, the EU unveiled a plan to phase out Russian crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of the year, as part of its sixth sanction package aimed against Moscow.  Hungary and other Eastern European countries, whose economies are largely reliant on Russian oil, are not ready yet to accept the sanction package in its current form.  Traders also weighed risks to the demand side.  In its monthly report released on Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries revised down its forecast for world oil demand growth in 2022, citing impacts from geopolitical tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the week, the U.S. crude standard rose 0.7 percent, while Brent declined 0.7 percent, based on the front-month contracts.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The fire broke out at around 4:40 p.m. local time in the building located near the Mundka metro station in outer Delhi.  "A total of 16 bodies were recovered from the three-storey commercial building which had caught fire this evening near Delhi's Mundka metro station," Atul Garg, director of the Delhi fire service, told local media.  According to Garg, the third floor of the building was yet to be searched.  Police officials said the death toll was likely to rise as many people were feared trapped in the building.  "Rescue operation is underway in the building," a police official said.  Officials said 24 fire tenders were at the spot to contain the blaze.  "It's a massive fire and heavy cranes are being used to go up and douse the fire," a fire service official said.  The cause of the fire is not immediately known.

(Xinhua/Ren Chao)  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- As of Friday, the worldwide count of COVID-19 cases has exceeded 520 million, with over 6 million related deaths.  As the world is plagued by major challenges, not least a pandemic unseen in a century, Chinese President Xi Jinping has on multiple occasions called on the international community to take concerted actions against the virus.  The following are some highlights of his remarks on how cooperation can help the world survive.  April 21, 2022  In his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, Xi stressed that we need to work together to defend people's lives and health.  For humanity to clinch a final victory against the COVID-19 pandemic, more hard efforts are needed. It is essential that countries support each other, better coordinate response measures and improve global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic, said Xi.

(Rouelle Umali/Xinhua)  Jan. 17, 2022  At the virtual session of the 2022 World Economic Forum, Xi pledged to embrace cooperation on jointly overcoming the pandemic and champion economic globalization.  As COVID-19 is resurging with more variants and spreading faster than before, Xi stressed the importance of fully leveraging vaccines as a powerful weapon and ensuring the equitable distribution of vaccines to close the global immunization gap.  Xi called on countries to strengthen international cooperation against COVID-19, carry out active cooperation on the research and development of medicines, jointly build multiple lines of defense against the coronavirus, and speed up efforts to build a global community of health for all.  Dec. 31, 2021  China has provided 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations for the global COVID response, Xi said in his 2022 New Year Address.  "Only through unity, solidarity and cooperation can countries around the world write a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind," he said.

(Xinhua/Wang Ping)  Nov. 29, 2021  China and Africa should fight COVID-19 with solidarity, deepen practical cooperation, promote green development, and uphold equity and justice, Xi said at the opening ceremony of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation via video link.  On fighting COVID-19 with solidarity, Xi stressed the need to truly ensure the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in Africa.  Oct. 31, 2021  While addressing the 16th G20 Leaders' Summit via video link, Xi said that at present, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered multiple crises.  The development achievements made by the international community over the years have been seriously eroded and developing countries are facing unprecedented challenges and tests, Xi pointed out.  The COVID-19 pandemic has once again shown that all countries, with high stakes in each other's future and converging interests, form a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi said, noting that promoting sustainable development in developing countries will benefit the people of the countries concerned, and also affect the future and destiny of the whole mankind and the Earth.  Sept. 24, 2021  While delivering a speech via video at the opening ceremony of the 2021 Zhongguancun Forum, Xi called on all countries to strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology.  Xi noted that nowadays profound changes unseen in a century are evolving rapidly in the world and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far-reaching, presenting severe challenges for the recovery of the global economy.  All countries in the world need to strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology, explore ways and means of jointly solving important global issues through sci-tech innovation, address the challenges of the times together, and promote the noble cause of peace and development for all, said Xi.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)  *The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements.   *The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House is peddling its so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" against China and ramping up its pressure campaign of the Russia-Ukraine conflict during a two-day summit in Washington with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  But its hope to pull ASEAN members into its camp will shrivel, as ASEAN countries have already woken up to Washington's typical hegemony, hypocrisy and egomania.  The arrangement of the summit itself has laid bare Washington's double-dealing nature. Its disrespect for ASEAN members concerning scheduling issues despite its pledge of "enduring commitment" has sparked a wave of complaints among ASEAN members, resulting in a postponement of the summit from late March to May.  Cambodian Minister attached to the Prime Minister Kao Kim Hourn said before the summit that if Washington was serious about improving its ties with ASEAN, it should have arranged bilateral meetings between the United States and ASEAN countries. ASEAN leaders "should be treated with respect and equality," he noted.  The U.S. administration has long taken pleasure in organizing destructive meetings under the guise of constructive engagements. The so-called "Indo-Pacific Strategy" it is selling at this summit, for example, claims to maintain regional freedom and openness and respect ASEAN centrality in regional affairs, but in reality incites confrontation, undermines unity, and threatens cooperation and development in the region through such exclusive geopolitical blocs as AUKUS and Quad.  Many sober minds in ASEAN have seen through this duplicity and bullying. Indonesia and Malaysia warned that AUKUS could lead to a major arms race in the region. A recent report by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies showed that many ASEAN members have expressed concerns that the so-called "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" is "primarily a political endeavor meant to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative."    Photo taken on March 24, 2022 shows the U.S. national flag (R) on the U.S. Embassy building in Moscow, Russia. (Xinhua/Bai Xueqi)  Meanwhile, the White House will attempt in vain during this summit to talk ASEAN into imposing sanctions against Russia. Ever since the escalation of the current Ukraine crisis, Washington has been trying to exert pressure on ASEAN to take sides, but most of ASEAN members did not follow suit.  On April 7, six of the 10-member bloc abstained from voting in favor of a resolution to remove Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and two voted against it. Long adhering to an independent foreign policy, ASEAN members have urged solving the crisis through negotiation and dialogue.  Moreover, some ASEAN members have been well aware of Washington's unspoken calculations to turn bloody sufferings of others into golden opportunities for profits in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, during his visit to China in early April, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said he appreciates China's objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue, that "Asian countries should maintain peace and stability in the region, jointly resist unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law, and prevent attempts to create tensions and replicate crises in the region."  Playing small clique politics and forcing others to take sides -- Washington's old tricks to gain geopolitical interests -- work against ASEAN's will to uphold regional peace and stability and to realize sustainable economic development. Launching trade wars and breaking pacts -- Washington's classical acts of unilateralism -- severely disrupt normal trade exchanges and supply chains in the region and deal a heavy blow to ASEAN's economy. All those wrongdoings have tarnished Washington's credit and influence as the world's sole superpower, and driven it further apart from ASEAN members.  The long arc of history teaches each and every country that acting without scruples almost always results in the reverse of what one desires. It is time for Washington to learn this lesson, abandon its old dream of Cold War hegemony, uphold an open and inclusive mindset, and play its due role in maintaining regional and global peace, stability and development.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

The security analysis, which serves as an important basis for Sweden's upcoming NATO membership decisions, has been prepared by all eight parliamentary parties, of which, the Left Party and the Green Party, however, do not support the report's conclusions as a whole.  Although the analysis listed a number of advantages of possible Swedish membership in NATO, with an "increased security" as the main conclusion, it does not provide a recommendation on whether Sweden should join.  However, the analysis is widely understood to serve as an important basis for the ruling Social Democrats' and the government's NATO decision, to be presented on Sunday and Monday respectively.  "The main conclusion of a possible membership in NATO is that Sweden would become part of NATO's collective security," said Foreign Minister Ann Linde at a press conference on Friday.  While the analysis assesses that Sweden will not be exposed to a conventional military attack as a reaction to a possible Swedish NATO application, Linde said that "an armed attack on Sweden can not be ruled out."  "We see a democratic decline in several countries today, even among countries that are members of NATO, which is not clearly mentioned. The Green Party's basic attitude towards NATO has not changed." Maria Ferm, member of the Green Party, told Swedish Television, emphasizing her party's opposition to joining NATO.  "We have therefore submitted a special opinion about this issue and about this analysis, because we do not agree with all the wording about NATO this analysis contains," Ferm emphasized.  "I think there is no analysis of the risks that a Swedish NATO membership entails." Hakan Svenneling, a member of the Left Party told Swedish Television, "We are making the biggest change in Swedish security policy in a very long time. And freedom of alliance has been very important and served Sweden well for a long time, and could do so for a long time to come."  "I am worried that every major conflict for a long time to come, for decades, will take place at Sweden's borders or in Sweden. This is something I do not want to be a part of, which is why I oppose Swedish NATO membership," Svenneling said.&nbsp;    Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde (R) and Minister of Defense Peter Hultqvist attend a press conference on a security analysis in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 13, 2022.

Large retail companies in Shanghai have started to reopen their supermarkets amid the recent COVID-19 resurgence. (Xinhua/Chen Jianli)  BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has exerted downward pressure on the Chinese economy. With an array of pro-growth policies to produce their intended effects, the risk is manageable and the sound fundamentals of the world's second-largest economy in the medium-to-long term will not change.  To cope with the pandemic, China has applied a stringent dynamic zero-COVID policy. As the pandemic is still raging across the world and coronavirus continues to mutate, there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning how the situation will develop. The country has warned against any slackening in its efforts to control the virus.  China's stance has been firm and clear -- unswervingly adhering to the dynamic zero-COVID policy while shoring up the economy and ensuring people's lives are affected as little as possible.  Giving proper consideration to all these aspects is a difficult task. The earnest implementation of this policy is a major test for all regions and departments.  A string of pro-growth policies is in the pipeline. China has already adopted multi-pronged fiscal measures in tax and fee cuts, public budget expenditure and bond issuance to stabilize the economy and ensure its people's wellbeing.  Moreover, China has accelerated the establishment of a unified domestic market, comprehensively strengthened infrastructure construction, and deepened reform and opening-up across the board.  The State Council and relevant departments are also rolling out detailed policies and measures to help industries, individually owned businesses and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises hit hard by the pandemic, and to stabilize market entities.

(Xinhua/Zhang Jiansong)  Chinese authorities have ample space and diversified tools for fiscal, monetary and other policies. They have rich experience in responding to downward pressure on the economy and will further strengthen regulatory control, and will do so when the time is right.  The Chinese economy is off to a steady start this year, with its GDP up 4.8 percent year on year in the first three months. Despite the downward pressure, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, including its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. After pro-growth policies gradually produce their intended effects, China's economic performance will improve.  By contributing approximately 30 percent to world economic growth, the Chinese economy is the largest engine driving global economic growth. The Chinese economy is at a critical moment in overcoming its difficulties. It is only by remaining confident and rising to the challenges that China can turn adverse situations into opportunities, embrace its bright prospects, continue to inject dynamism into the stability and recovery of the global economy and bring broader market opportunities for all countries.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to a query about a joint statement issued by Japan and the EU at a summit on Thursday, which expressed "concerns" over the situation of the Diaoyu Islands, East China Sea, South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, as well as so-called human rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.  Japan and the EU have hyped up China-related issues, made smearing remarks against China, interfered in China's internal affairs and instigated regional confrontation, Zhao said. "China is firmly opposed to such practice, and has lodged stern representation with relevant parties."  Zhao said the Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands have always been an inherent part of the Chinese territory, adding no matter what is said or done, the fact can never be altered that the islands belong to China.  Regarding maritime issues, Zhao said China will firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and at the same time is ready to settle differences with relevant countries via consultations.  As for issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, Zhao said they all fall within China's internal affairs, which brook no interference by any external forces. "We urge relevant countries to focus on putting their own house in order."  China's development means important opportunities for the world, Zhao said, citing facts that China's economy has contributed 30 percent to the world economic growth, and China's achievements in COVID-19 response have helped stabilize the global supply chain. The Belt and Road Initiative has benefited more than 180 countries and international organizations.  "The so-called China threat theory has gone bankrupt in face of facts," Zhao said.  Noting the world needs unity and cooperation more than ever before in face of challenges such as the resurgences of COVID-19 and lackluster economic recovery, Zhao urged Japan and the EU to abandon seeking ideological confrontation and a zero-sum game mindset, to practice real multilateralism and inject more positive energy into the world.&nbsp; Source: Xinhua ]]></full-text></doc>

(Photo by Fan Jiashan/People’s Daily Online)  China’s services trade has maintained fast growth. Data from the country’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) showed that China’s imports and exports of services totaled over 1.45 trillion yuan ($214.6 billion) in the first quarter of 2022, rising 25.8 percent year on year.  Its exports of services grew 30.8 percent to 713.98 billion yuan and imports of services reached 743.01 billion yuan with a year-on-year increase of 21.3 percent. The growth of services exports outpaced import growth by 9.5 percentage points, resulting in a 56.4-percent drop in the country’s services trade deficit to 29.03 billion yuan from the same period last year.  Zhao Zhonghui, director of the translation center of BERIS Engineering and Research Corporation in Qingdao city, east China’s Shandong province, has been busy dubbing a program of Shandong TV into Lao with her colleagues.  “This is a new service export project we launched this year. We’ve so far finished translating the Chinese subtitles into Lao, English and Romanian, and basically accomplished the dubbing work,” said Zhao, adding that the program will be aired on Lao National Television and Romanian public television TVR in a few days.  According to Zhao, the company completed the multilingual dubbing and subtitle translation of more than 10,000 standard episodes of TV programs in 2021. The programs it exported last year, which were 450,000 minutes in total length, have been broadcast on TV stations and online video platforms in 195 countries and regions and received over 10 billion hits globally, bringing the company an export value of several billion yuan.

(Photo by Fan Jiashan/People’s Daily Online)  During the rapid development of trade in services, knowledge-intensive service industry, as a key field, made remarkable progress and showed stronger export competitiveness, noted Zhang Jianping, head of the Center for Regional Economic Cooperation under the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.  China’s trade in knowledge-intensive services climbed 14.1 percent to 615.66 billion yuan in the first quarter of the year, according to an official with the Department of Trade in Services and Commercial Services of the MOFCOM.  Knowledge-intensive services exports expanded 16.3 percent to 350.06 billion yuan, among which exports of such fields as telecommunications, computer and information services, other business services, as well as intellectual property royalties registered fast growth, rising 22.1 percent, 14.6 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively.  Imports of knowledge-intensive services grew 11.4 percent to 265.6 billion yuan during the period.    A busy container terminal of Haikou Port, south China’s Hainan province, August 29, 2021.  The sound performance of China’s trade in services is attributed to Chinese enterprises’ increasing competitiveness and the government’s policies and measures.  On August 26, 2021, China officially began to implement a negative list for cross-border trade in services in the southern island province of Hainan. The introduction and implementation of the negative list represented a major breakthrough in the management model of trade in services and signaled further opening-up in cross-border trade in services.  An MOFCOM official recently disclosed that the country plans to formulate a negative list for cross-border trade in services that is applicable to all of its 21 pilot free trade zones (FTZs) this year, and will promote the introduction of a national negative list for cross-border services trade in due course.  In March, the general office of the MOFCOM issued a circular on making good use of the guidance funds for the innovative development of services trade to support the development of new trade forms and models, encouraging leveraging new ways of financing to stimulate new trade forms and models.  The MOFCOM and six other government departments lately approved a new batch of 40 specialized bases for featured services export. China is now home to 112 bases for featured services export, which cover seven fields including culture, traditional Chinese medicine, digital services, human resources, geographic information, intellectual property and language services.  The 2022 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), which is scheduled to be held both online and offline in September, will focus on trends in services trade, highlight digitalization and green development, and add a thematic exhibition of environment services.  Six kinds of activities will be held during this year’s CIFTIS, including the Global Trade in Services Summit, exhibition, conference and forum, promotion and negotiation, achievement release as well as supporting activities.  The exhibition will cover an area of no less than 126,000 square meters, and over 100 conferences, forums, promotion and negotiation activities will be held.  As an important part of international trade and a major field of international economic and trade cooperation, services trade plays a key role in building a new development pattern.  Last year, the value added of China’s service sector accounted for 53.3 percent of the country’s GDP, and the country’s total trade in services reached 5.3 trillion yuan, ranking second in the world for eight consecutive years.  On the whole, China’s trade in services is characterized by constantly expanding scale, steadily increasing added value and continuously growing competitiveness, and still has huge potential for growth and great market opportunities.

(Photo/Courtesy of China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology)  China’s Long March-7 Y5 carrier rocket launched the country’s Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China’s Hainan province at 1:56 a.m. on May 10, Beijing time, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), which declared the launch a complete success.  The launch was the 22nd launch mission of China’s manned space program, the first launch mission since the construction of the country’s space station shifted from the key technology verification phase to the in-orbit construction phase, and the 420th flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series.  The Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft successfully completed status setting after entering orbit. At 8:54 a.m. on May 10, Tianzhou-4 conducted a fast automated rendezvous and docking at the rear docking port of the Tianhe core module of China’s space station, delivering goods to its destination within few hours after launch.  All the food, clothing, equipment and other supplies astronauts need for long-term stay in space must be carried to space station in time by cargo spacecraft, as well as the fuel the space station requires to maintain its orbit.  Last year, Long March-7 Y3 and Long March-7 Y4 carrier rockets sent the Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft, respectively, into space, delivering supplies for the construction of the country’s space station.  This time, before the arrival of the three crew members, the Tianzhou-4 cargo ship carried the necessary supplies for the forthcoming six-month Shenzhou-14 crewed mission to the space station. The cargo vessel brought more than 200 sets of items into orbit, including consumables for the Shenzhou-14 crew, propellants, gadgets, equipment, and samples for application experiments and testing, as well as replacement components and payloads.  Tianzhou-4, after rendezvous and docking with the combination of the space station core module Tianhe and the Tianzhou-3 cargo craft, joined the combination.  In order to ensure supplies can be delivered to the space accommodations safely, the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft has used cargo bags, racks, and storage tanks to carry goods. The categories and quantities of the transported goods vary according to the needs of the space station.  Simultaneously, the cargo craft can also undertake tasks including controlling the attitude and orbital trajectory of the space station and supporting space science experiment.  According to a designer with Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, the construction of China’s space station is like putting together building blocks, and the docking mechanism is the joint that connects various modules with each other.  Since China’s first-ever rendezvous and docking of two spacecraft in 2011, the country has successfully carried out rendezvous and docking of spacecraft for 19 times, which laid a solid technological foundation for the construction of its space station.  The docking mechanism is going to face bigger tests this year as it will need to connect the Wentian and Mengtian lab modules with the space station combination.

(Photo/Courtesy of China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology)  During the construction of the space station, the docking mechanism needs to handle various ways of docking of spacecraft whose weights range from 8 to 180 tons. Besides, huge docking energy can be generated during the process, which poses high requirements on the docking mechanism’s buffering and energy dissipation capacity.  To make sure two heavyweight spacecraft can dock with each other successfully, designers have carried out massive studies and research on relevant plans and finally mastered the key technology.  The launch of the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft is expected to be followed by the launch of the Shenzhou-14 crewed mission in June, the Wentian lab module in July, and the Mengtian lab module in October. The two lab modules and the Tianhe core module will form a T-shaped structure, with the core module at the center and the two lab modules attached to each side of it. The formation of the basic structure will signal the completion of the space station.  Hao Chun, director of the CMSA, says that upon the completion of the in-orbit construction of the space station this year, it will enter a phase of application and development that is expected to span over 10 years.  “The initial plan is to launch two manned spacecraft and two cargo spacecraft each year. Astronauts will stay in the space station for a long time to carry out space science experiments and to maintain the space station,” Hao said.  As the first launch mission of the space station missions in 2022, the launch of the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft marked the beginning of the in-orbit construction of the space station and made people start counting down to the completion of “a new home in space” that will benefit all humanity.
